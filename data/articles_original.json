As ‌part⁣ of this ⁤agreement, city leaders have⁣ pledged to enforce higher standards and provide improved training for local police.\n\nThe announcement was made just two days shy of the two-year mark of one​ of the most devastating school shootings in the history‍ of the United States. ‌On May 24, 2022, a teenage‌ shooter stormed into⁢ a fourth-grade classroom at‍ Robb Elementary School, killing 19 students and‍ two teachers.\n\nThis lawsuit is the most recent in a series of ​legal actions seeking to hold law enforcement accountable for their response. Despite more than 370 federal, state, and local officers arriving ‌at ‌the scene, ⁣they waited over⁤ 70⁣ minutes before confronting the shooter.\n\nThe lawsuit highlights that state troopers failed to adhere to their active shooter training and duty ‌to ​confront the shooter. Meanwhile, the students and teachers‍ inside the school were following⁢ their lockdown protocols, ​which included turning off lights, locking ⁢doors, and‍ maintaining silence.\n\n“The protocols trap‌ teachers and students inside, leaving them fully reliant on law ⁣enforcement to respond quickly‌ and effectively,” the families and their attorneys stated.\n\n‘A Complete Betrayal’\n\nInside the classroom,⁤ terrified students dialed ⁤911 ⁣while distraught parents pleaded with officers, some of whom could hear gunshots while standing ⁤in a hallway,⁣ to ​intervene. A tactical team of officers eventually entered‍ the classroom and neutralized the shooter.\n\n“The inaction of law enforcement that day was a⁢ total and⁤ absolute betrayal of⁤ these families and⁢ the sons, daughters, and mothers they lost,” said Erin Rogiers, one of the attorneys representing the families. “TXDPS had the resources, training, and firepower to respond ​appropriately, and they ignored all ⁤of it and failed on every level. These families have not only the right but also ⁣the responsibility⁤ to demand justice.”\n\nA criminal investigation ⁢into the police response by Uvalde District Attorney Christina⁢ Mitchell’s office is still underway. A grand​ jury was convened this year, and some law enforcement ‌officials ‌have already been summoned to⁣ testify.\n\nThe lawsuit, which‌ targets 92 Texas Department of Public Safety officials‍ and ⁣troopers, also names the Uvalde‌ School District, former Robb Elementary Principal Mandy Gutierrez, and former Uvalde schools police Chief Peter Arredondo as defendants.\n\nAnother lawsuit filed in December 2022 against local and state ‍police, the city, and other school and law enforcement, seeks at least⁢ $27 billion and class-action status ⁣for survivors. Additionally, at least two other lawsuits have been filed against Georgia-based gun ⁤manufacturer Daniel Defense, which produced the AR-style rifle used by the gunman.\n\nThe settlement with the city was capped at $2 million as⁢ the families⁣ stated ​they didn’t want to bankrupt the city where they still reside and to allow the community to continue its healing⁣ process. The settlement will be covered‍ by the city’s insurance.\n\nAs part of the settlement, the city agreed to a new “fitness for duty” standard and enhanced training for Uvalde police officers.⁤ It also establishes May 24 as an ⁤annual day of remembrance, a permanent memorial in the city plaza, and support for mental health services ⁢for the families and the broader Uvalde area.\n\nThe ​police response to the mass shooting has been heavily criticized and⁤ scrutinized by state and federal authorities. ⁣A 600-page Justice Department report in January detailed​ “cascading failures” in training, communication, leadership, and technology on that day.\n\nAnother report commissioned by the city also pointed⁣ out ‍numerous missteps by law enforcement but defended the actions of local police, which sparked outrage from⁢ victims’ families.\n\n“For two long years, ‍we have languished in pain and without any accountability from⁢ the law enforcement agencies ​and officers who allowed our families to be destroyed⁣ that ​day,” said‌ Veronica⁤ Luevanos, whose daughter Jailah and nephew Jayce ‌were ‍among⁢ the victims. “This settlement reflects ⁢a first good faith effort, particularly by the City of Uvalde, to begin rebuilding trust in the systems that failed to protect us.”","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/05/22/texas-state-police-face-lawsuit-from-uvalde-school-shooting-victims-families-over-mishandled-response/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Grizzly Bear Attack in British Columbia Leaves Hunter with Severe Injuries, Hospitalized","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/4901-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"In the ⁣picturesque region of ELKFORD, British Columbia, a dramatic event unfolded as a ​36-year-old man was rushed to a hospital via helicopter following a grizzly bear attack.

Robert Menendez was depicted by a federal‍ prosecutor as a politician driven by greed, willing to disrupt local ‌criminal investigations and assist foreign governments in return for bribes, including gold bars.\n\nThe prosecutor, Lara Pomerantz, informed the jury on Wednesday that Menendez, the senior senator⁤ from New Jersey, utilized​ his wife as an intermediary. He attempted to aid Egypt in securing billions‍ in U.S. ‌military assistance and⁤ further the business and‍ legal interests⁣ of two businessmen from ⁣his state involved in local criminal ⁤cases.\n\n“Robert Menendez, for years, has been​ betraying the people he was elected to serve by accepting bribes,” ⁢ Pomerantz stated during the ‌prosecution’s⁢ opening statement in​ Manhattan federal court.\n\nShe further added, “This case revolves around a public official who prioritized greed, who placed ⁤his‌ own interests above his duty to the people, who put his power on⁤ the auction ⁢block. This was not your typical politics. This ⁤was ​politics driven by profit.”\n\nProsecutors have labeled Menendez‍ as the key player in a five-year‌ scheme where he accepted ⁤hundreds‍ of thousands of ⁢dollars in bribes in return for political favors​ and assistance to the governments‌ of ‍Egypt and Qatar.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the bribes received by Menendez and his ⁣wife, Nadine Menendez, included cash, gold bars, mortgage payments, and a Mercedes-Benz convertible. The⁤ 70-year-old, three-term senator has pleaded not guilty to⁤ 16 criminal charges including bribery, fraud, acting as a foreign ​agent, and obstruction. Wael Hana‍ and‌ Fred Daibes, the two ⁢New Jersey businessmen being tried alongside him, have also pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe defense lawyers will also ⁣present their ‍opening statements.\n\nNadine Menendez, 57, has also been charged and pleaded not guilty. She is set to face trial on July 8, with the delay resulting from what her lawyers have ⁣described as a serious medical‌ condition.\n\nThe senator’s trial could extend until early July. This is the senator’s second trial on bribery charges,⁤ which cost him the leadership of⁢ the influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Menendez’s previous trial concluded in 2017​ in a mistrial after the jury was unable to reach a verdict.\n\nEarlier‍ in the ⁢day, U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein selected 12 jurors and six alternates, including an investment banker, a commercial litigator, a retired economist, a doctor,⁤ and multiple therapists. They‌ were chosen over 2-1/2 ⁤days of jury selection from a pool of 150 potential jurors.\n\nInterference\n\nPomerantz outlined what prosecutors believe to be a complex⁣ and​ scandalous web ⁢of corruption spanning from 2018 to 2023, with the Menendezes accepting bribes‌ from Hana, Daibes, and an ⁤associate of Hana, insurance broker​ Jose Uribe.\n\nPomerantz stated that in return, the ⁤senator assisted Hana ⁤in securing a profitable⁣ monopoly on certifying that meat exports ⁣to Egypt adhered to Islamic law, and attempted to help Daibes obtain millions of dollars ⁣from a Qatari investment ⁢fund.\n\nMenendez has also been accused of attempting to interfere in a federal criminal case against Daibes in New Jersey, including by recommending ​a candidate⁢ to be the ⁢top federal prosecutor there, and in state criminal cases involving two of Uribe’s associates.\n\nPomerantz said Menendez tried to cover his tracks by​ having ​his wife communicate ⁢about the bribes, but that she kept him informed.\n\nProsecutors have ⁤stated that⁢ FBI agents ‌discovered more than $480,000 of cash in ⁢the Menendezes’ home, much of ⁢it hidden in clothing, closets, and a‍ safe.\n\nThey also ‍stated that Hana and‌ Daibes provided more than $100,000 of gold bars to the Menendezes, while‍ Uribe assisted the couple‌ in purchasing ​the Mercedes. Pomerantz said the money for that purchase was disguised as a loan.\n\nUribe ⁢pleaded guilty​ in March to bribery and fraud and is expected to testify against Menendez.\n\nWhile Nadine ​Menendez is not yet on trial, ⁣her husband’s lawyers have​ suggested ‍his defense might include an attempt to blame‌ her ‍for ⁤withholding information and making him believe his activities were⁤ lawful.\n\nRobert Menendez‌ became a​ senator in 2006. Prior to being indicted, he would have‍ been favored in his Democratic-leaning state to win a fourth full Senate term in November.\n\nHowever, any re-election‌ bid now would be a long shot,⁣ reflecting recent⁤ polls of voters that⁤ show overwhelming disapproval of Menendez’s job performance.\n\nMenendez has suggested that he would try if acquitted to run as an ⁢independent. Only 9% of⁤ voters polled in March by Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill said they would⁣ prefer him to another Democrat or a Republican.\n\nThe senator has resisted calls to resign made from across the political spectrum.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/05/16/prosecutor-accuses-us-senator-menendez-of-greed-driven-corruption-as-trial-commences/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Prosecutors Recommend 40-Year Jail Term for Assailant of Pelosi’s Spouse","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/4859-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"SAN FRANCISCO — Prosecutors have recommended a 40-year prison ⁢sentence⁤ for the individual who forcefully entered the residence of former U.S. House Speaker‌ Nancy Pelosi and brutally attacked her husband with a hammer. They argue that his federal offenses equate to an act of terrorism.\n\nIn a ⁣memorandum submitted to the U.S. District Court in San Francisco, the prosecution team stated that David Wayne DePape, the ⁤convicted man, has⁤ shown no signs of‍ regret for his actions. They believe he⁣ deserves no ⁣mercy and should be given ‍the maximum statutory penalties for⁤ each ⁢of the two charges he was found guilty of last year.\n\nThe memorandum read, ⁤”This case​ comes at a time when radicalism has resulted in ⁣assaults on public figures and elected officials. It provides an opportunity ⁢to‍ send⁣ a ⁤strong message to those nurturing violent ‌ideologies and plans.”\n\nThe sentencing is scheduled for May 17.\n\nIn November, a federal⁢ court jury found DePape guilty of attempting to‍ abduct Pelosi, who was then the speaker ⁢of the U.S. House of Representatives, and assaulting‍ her husband, Paul Pelosi, due to her official role as a⁢ Congress ⁢member.\n\nThe prosecution team suggested that DePape should ⁤be given the maximum prison term for each charge — 20 years for attempted kidnapping and 30 years for assault — ⁢with 20 years of the second charge to ‍be served consecutively⁢ to the first, resulting​ in a total ​of 40⁤ years in prison.\n\nAlthough DePape was not found guilty of terrorism, ‌his offenses — committed a ⁢week before the ​2022⁣ congressional midterm elections — fit the federal definition of terrorism as a crime “designed to influence or affect the conduct of government through intimidation or coercion,”​ according to the prosecutors.\n\nThe prosecutors considered this situation as a⁤ factor for sentencing “enhancement.”\n\nDePape forcefully entered Pelosi’s San Francisco residence in the early hours of Oct. 28, 2022, confronted her ‍husband, and struck him on the head with a hammer⁢ before‌ the police, who were alerted, managed to⁢ apprehend the intruder.\n\nAt the time of the incident, the House speaker,​ who is second in the constitutional line of ​succession to the presidency,‌ was in Washington. Paul Pelosi, then 82, ​was ‌admitted to the hospital for ‍several days due to skull fractures and injuries to his hands and right arm.\n\nEvidence presented ​at the trial revealed that DePape, a Canadian citizen who had been residing‌ in the United States illegally for 14 years at‌ the time of⁢ the attack, was influenced by far-right conspiracy theories, particularly those propagated by the extremist QAnon movement.\n\nThe sentencing memorandum referred to DePape’s⁤ own trial testimony, in which he admitted his​ plan was to abduct Nancy Pelosi, interrogate her, and break her ‍kneecaps if she was found​ to be lying.\n\nThe jury also ⁤listened to a recording of an interview DePape gave to a television station in 2023, in ⁢which he expressed regret for not ⁤causing more harm, stating, “I should have come better prepared.”\n\nAlong with⁣ highlighting DePape’s lack of remorse, the prosecutors argued that the severity of the crime and the need to deter ‌others from committing similar acts justified the harshest possible sentence.\n\nDePape is also facing ‍separate state charges related to the Pelosi break-in and attack, including attempted murder, which could result in a sentence of 13 years to life in prison.

Violations⁤ can result in fines of‌ up to ⁢$1,000 or jail time of up to 30 days.\n\nLast⁣ week, Merchan imposed⁣ a $9,000 fine on Trump for nine social media posts that were deemed ‍to have violated the gag ⁣order.\n\nTrump‌ has frequently voiced his dissatisfaction with the gag order, claiming that it hampers his ability to present his case ‍to voters in his bid to ‍return ‍to the​ White ​House.\n\n“My constitutional right to speak has been taken away,” Trump told reporters outside the courtroom before ‍the start‌ of⁤ the 12th ⁤day of trial.\n\nExamination ⁤of Payment Records\n\nOn Monday, ⁣prosecutors presented business records to the jurors, showing payments totaling $420,000⁣ from Trump to ⁤Cohen, his former personal lawyer ‍and fixer.\n\nThese payments were recorded as ‍legal fees, but prosecutors argue that they ⁢were actually intended to reimburse Cohen‍ for a $130,000 payment made ‌to Daniels⁣ to silence her about a sexual encounter she claims to⁤ have‌ had with Trump⁤ in 2006. Trump denies ever⁢ having a sexual relationship with Daniels.\n\nProsecutors ⁢allege that the $420,000 paid by Trump was intended to cover the $130,000 Cohen paid‌ to Daniels, along with $50,000 in other expenses⁤ he had incurred. Trump doubled that total to account for taxes and also included a $60,000 year-end bonus, they claim.\n\nJeffrey McConney, a former controller in Trump’s organization, testified that he⁣ was not aware of any other instance in which the Trump Organization reimbursed ⁤someone ⁣so generously.\n\nHe stated ⁣that he was informed by the company’s top finance official, Allen ⁤Weisselberg, that​ the payments were reimbursements, not legal ⁤fees. He also stated that he never discussed‍ the‍ payments ⁢with Trump.\n\nProsecutors also presented ledger entries to the jurors, showing that⁣ payments⁢ to Cohen were not listed among ⁢the legal ‌expenses the company paid‌ to outside lawyers.\n\nMost of the jurors appeared ‌to scrutinize‍ the email messages displayed on the screens in⁤ front of their seats as ​McConney testified.\n\nProsecutors argue that Trump’s payment to Daniels​ corrupted⁢ the 2016 election by withholding the news from voters,⁢ at a⁣ time when his⁣ treatment of women was a key ⁤issue in his campaign against Democratic candidate Hillary ​Clinton.\n\nThey ‌claim that the altered business records concealed election-law and ‍tax-law violations‌ that elevate the ‌34 counts Trump faces from misdemeanors to felonies punishable by up to four ‍years ​in prison.\n\nIf found guilty, Trump could face up to four years in ⁢prison,‍ although defendants typically face fines and ‍probation.\n\nThe key figures in⁢ the case, including Cohen and ⁢Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie⁢ Clifford, have yet to testify.\n\nWhile the case‌ involves salacious allegations of adultery⁣ and secret payoffs, ⁣it is⁤ generally considered⁣ less significant⁢ than the three other criminal prosecutions Trump faces.

We truly gave ⁣it our ⁢all today.”\n\nDespite Amsterdam initiating the scoring with a three-run in the first inning, Burnt Hills ⁢retaliated with four runs in the⁤ second inning.

Teams from all over the region are ⁢gearing up ⁢to extend ​their seasons and battle​ it out on the⁣ field.\n\nHere are five key points to ‍keep in mind⁢ as we​ head into the playoffs.\n\nTHE SERIES FORMAT\n\nTwo years ago, Section ​2 introduced a best-of-three playoff series to crown its Class AA‍ champion.‌ This year, with the addition of a sixth classification by NYSPHSAA, Section 2 has expanded this best-of-three format.\n\nIn Class AAA, the largest school division, both the semifinal and ⁤championship⁣ rounds will be⁤ a‍ best-of-three series. In⁤ Class AA, only the championship round will ​follow this format. All other classifications, from A to D, will stick to a ⁤single ⁢game format.\n\nThe Class AAA bracket includes five teams. Colonie will host CBA in a play-in game on Wednesday. The victor will then face No. 1 Shenendehowa, the defending⁣ champion, in a semifinal series.\n\nOn the‍ other side of the‍ bracket, No. 2 Saratoga Springs will compete against No. 3 ⁢Shaker in a best-of-three series.\n\nFor the semifinal rounds, teams will alternate home games. ⁣The higher seed will host ⁣Game 1 and, if necessary, ⁣Game 3, while the lower seed will host Game 2.\n\nAll championship series games will be held at the Joseph L. Bruno Stadium.\n\nNISKY LEADS AA\n\nOver the past‍ few years, ​Niskayuna has⁣ been on the brink of ⁣making ⁣a significant run in the Section 2 tournament.\n\nThis ⁤year, the Silver Warriors‍ have secured the top seed‌ in Class AA after‍ an impressive 15-4 overall record. Niskayuna will wait​ for the winner of a first-round game between Averill Park and Troy, as it has a bye to the quarterfinals.\n\nBethlehem secured ‍the No. 2 seed in Class AA, while Ballston Spa took ⁢No. 3‌ and South Glens Falls earned‍ No.​ 4, in⁣ the 12-team field.\n\nThe Class AA semifinals ​and championship series are all‌ set ​to be played at Joseph L. Bruno Stadium.\n\nIMPENDING ⁤SHOWDOWN\n\nChatham has​ secured the top ‌seed in Class C, which may have ignited a competitive spark in Saratoga Catholic.\n\nChatham, the defending ⁣NYSPHSAA Class‍ C champions, posted‍ a 16-4 overall record and went undefeated in the Patroon Conference. However, one of their four losses was against Saratoga ⁢Catholic, which had an 18-2 overall record​ and 12-2 in the Wasaren League.\n\nThe Saints defeated the Panthers 11-8 in ‌a non-league matchup on May 2,‍ and it’s highly likely we’ll see these two‍ teams face off ⁤again at ‘The ⁣Joe’, for the ⁢right to advance to ⁣states.\n\nUNDEFEATED NO. 2\n\nIt’s quite unusual for a team to go ⁢undefeated during the ‍regular season and not secure the top seed in the section tournament.\n\nHowever, ⁢that’s exactly what happened to Mechanicville this ⁣season. Despite a ⁢16-0​ overall record and 14-0 in the Wasaren League, they received the No. 2 ‌seed in Section 2’s Class B bracket.\n\nSchuylerville, ‍with a ​16-4 overall record and⁤ 10-3 in the Foothills ⁢Council, clinched the top seed.\n\nThroughout the season, Mechanicville scored a whopping 202 runs, while allowing just 70.\n\nA potential showdown between Mechanicville ‍and⁤ Schuylerville is brewing as we approach‍ the games at ‘The Joe.’\n\nPATRIOTS ON THE PROWL\n\nMost of Broadalbin-Perth’s current players were ​too young to be ‌a part‍ of the⁤ Patriots’ ‍dramatic run to​ the Section 2 title in 2021. However, they’ve been chasing that feeling ever since.\n\nBroadalbin-Perth is in a strong position to reclaim the top spot, ​as it secured the No. 2 ⁣seed in the Class A bracket, after ​posting a 10-7 overall record⁤ and 10-3 ⁣in the Foothills ‌Council.\n\nThe‍ Patriots⁤ were only bested⁣ by La ⁣Salle, which posted​ a 14-3 overall⁣ record and 12-1 ⁢in the‍ Colonial ⁣Council, to secure⁣ the top seed.\n\nCohoes took the ⁤No. 3 seed⁢ in ⁢the⁤ bracket, while Ichabod ⁣Crane was No. 4, out of the 12-team field.\n\nSCHEDULE\nWEDNESDAY\n\nPLAY-IN\n\nCLASS C — Berlin/New ⁣Lebanon at Hoosic Valley, 4.\n\nFIRST ROUND\n\nCLASS AAA — ‌CBA ⁢at Colonie, ‍4:15.\n\nCLASS AA ‍— Troy at Averill Park, 4; Mohonasen at Queensbury, 4; Burnt Hills-Ballston Lake ‍at Amsterdam, 4; Guilderland at Columbia, 4.\n\nTHURSDAY\n\nFIRST ROUND\n\nCLASS A — Glens Falls at ‌Schalmont, 4; Hudson Falls at Ravena-Coeymans-Selkirk, 4; Gloversville at‍ Scotia-Glenville, 4; Lansingburgh at Albany Academy, 4.\n\nCLASS B — Notre Dame-Bishop‍ Gibbons at Schuylerville,‍ 4; Hudson at Catskill, ⁣4; Corinth at Coxsackie-Athens, 4; Voorheesville at ⁢Mechanicville, 4; Cairo-Durham at Granville, 4; Cobleskill-Richmondville at Taconic Hills, 4; Salem-Cambridge at Johnstown, 4; Stillwater at Fonda-Fultonville,‌ 5.\n\nCLASS C — Berlin or Hoosic Valley at Chatham, ‍4; Waterford-Halfmoon at Middleburgh, 4; Mayfield at ‌Duanesburg,‌ 4; Greenwich at Galway, 4; Lake George at Canajoharie,‍ 4; Schoharie at Hoosick Falls, 4; Berne-Knox-Westerlo at​ Maple Hill, 5; Whitehall at Saratoga Catholic, 7.\n\nCLASS ‌D — Doane/Loudonville at Loudonville, ⁣4.\n\nFRIDAY\n\nSEMIFINALS ⁢GAME 1\n\nCLASS AAA — CBA/Colonie at Shenendehowa, 4; Shaker at Saratoga Springs,‌ 4.\n\nSATURDAY\n\nSEMIFINALS GAME 2\n\nCLASS AAA — Shenendehowa ⁢at ⁢CBA/Colonie, 1; Saratoga Springs⁣ at Shaker, 1.\n\nQUARTERFINALS\n\nCLASS A — ​Schalmont/Glens Falls winner at La Salle, 1; Ravena/Hudson Falls winner at Ichabod Crane, 1; Scotia-Glenville/Gloversville winner at ​Broadalbin-Perth, 1; Albany Academy/Lansingburgh winner at Cohoes,⁢ 1.\n\nCLASS​ B — at higher seeds, 1\n\nCLASS C — at higher seeds, 1\n\nSEMIFINALS\n\nCLASS D — Germantown/Doane winner at Warrensburg, ⁣1; Mekeel Christian Academy at ‍North Warren, 1; Argyke at Hadley Luzerne, 1; Fort⁢ Ann ​at Hartford/Fort Edward, 1.\n\nMONDAY\n\nSEMIFINALS GAME 3\n\n(if‌ necessary)\n\nCLASS AAA — CBA/Colonie at⁤ Shenendehowa, 4; Shaker at Saratoga Springs, 4.\n\nSEMIFINALS\n\nCLASS A — at⁣ Dutchman Park, 4 and 7.\n\nCLASS B — at⁤ Shuttleworth⁢ Park, 4 and 7.\n\nCLASS C — at Gloversville Husky Field, 4 and 7.\n\nCLASS D ⁣— at Lansingburgh, 4 and 7.\n\nMAY 23, 24, 26\n\nCHAMPIONSHIP SERIES\n\n(Best-of-three)\n\nat Joseph L.

This⁣ budget proposal promises to maintain the current tax rates for city homeowners.\n\nThe proposed budget,‌ which marks a 0% tax levy increase for the sixth year in a row, aims to‍ maintain the current staffing levels ⁣and student programs. This represents a $12.4 ⁤million increase from the previous year’s budget of $265.2 million, which was‌ approved‍ by taxpayers in May of⁣ the previous year.\n\nThe Schenectady school board gave‌ their unanimous⁣ approval to the proposed budget on April 24.\n\n“This ‍budget ‌is designed⁤ to allow our district to⁢ continue⁤ implementing research-based ⁣academic, social, and developmentally appropriate frameworks⁤ and curriculums to cater to the diverse needs of all our students,” said Bernice Rivera,‌ the⁤ President of the Board of Education, on Monday. ​“It also allocates funds for ongoing‌ staff professional development, focusing on evidence-based strategies to enhance our academic work, ⁢particularly in ‌literacy and math.”\n\nThe district is⁢ set to receive $204.5 million ​in state ⁤funding for the 2024-2025⁢ fiscal ‍year, marking⁣ a $12 million increase from ⁣the previous⁣ year.\n\nThree candidates are vying ​for two three-year terms​ on the school board in Tuesday’s ​election. Incumbent board⁢ member⁢ Jamaica Miles ​is‍ seeking re-election, while challengers ⁣Alexandria ⁢Carver and Claudia Cavanagh‍ are hoping to secure their first⁢ terms on the board. Current board member Erica⁢ Brockmyer has decided not to run for re-election this spring, leaving room for at least one ‍new⁢ face on the⁢ board.\n\nTwo‍ propositions will also be on the ballot. The first proposition seeks to expand the scope of‌ the $300‌ million ⁣capital⁢ project approved​ by ⁢district taxpayers last⁣ May. This proposition would ‌allow the district to carry out demolition ⁣and renovation work at Keane ⁣Elementary and fund the renovation ‌of Pleasant ​Valley ⁣Elementary. However, it would not increase the $300‌ million⁢ in infrastructure spending approved by voters last spring.\n\n“We left out some wording⁣ in the capital project⁢ vote,” District Chief Financial Officer Terry Gillooley explained during the district’s May 8 budget hearing. “We’re not looking to borrow any ‍more⁢ money. We’re just ⁣looking to do some‍ additional work at Keane Elementary School and Pleasant Valley‍ Elementary School.”\n\nA ⁣second ​proposition⁢ on Tuesday’s ballot⁣ proposes the sale of a ‌288-foot portion of land on the‍ Van Corlaer Elementary campus to Gumani Unlimited, LLC for $1,000. ⁤The district discovered earlier ⁢this year that a house ⁣adjacent to the Guilderland Avenue elementary school was built over the school’s property line. If the proposition is approved by voters on Tuesday,​ the land will be ‌returned ⁤to the homeowner.\n\n“The house was built in the ⁤1930s, so it’s been like this for almost 100 years,” Gillooley said.\n\nVoting on the proposed school budget and the school board elections will take place on Tuesday‍ from noon to 9 p.m. at various district polling locations.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/05/21/tuesday-to-witness-voting-on-proposed-277m-budget-for-schenectady-schools-and-board-elections/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Three contenders battle for two positions on Schenectady school board","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/4892-6504724cba887.image_.jpg","content":"SCHENECTADY ⁢— The upcoming Tuesday election for the Schenectady school board‍ is heating up with three ‍candidates, including ⁢incumbent Jamaica Miles, ‌battling for two available seats. Miles is hoping to secure a second three-year term, while newcomers Alexandria Carver and Claudia Cavanagh are‌ eager⁤ to make‌ their debut on the ⁢board.\n\nCarver, currently serving as the city’s director ⁤of development, and Cavanagh, a former employee ‌of ​GE‍ and⁢ the New York State Court of Claims, are set ⁣to ‍challenge ​Miles, the co-founder and executive director of the All Of Us Community​ Action Group, in the⁢ May 21 election.\n\nMiles, who ‌was elected to ​her first term ‌in 2021 after playing a key role in a⁣ state lawsuit that led to full funding of Foundation Aid for ⁤school districts⁣ statewide, expressed⁣ her desire ⁣to continue the‍ work of⁤ the current school board into another term.‍ She highlighted the district’s first grading policy approved by the board in October, ⁣which aims to reduce bias in grading practices.\n\nMiles emphasized her intention to apply the insights gained from her first term to a potential second term⁤ on the​ council.\n\n“The key⁣ is to always ‍provide the time ⁢and space to ⁤listen,” she said.⁤ “This is a lesson I’ve learned over time. Our board is incredibly ‌diverse, ⁣and it’s crucial that we take the time‌ to listen to ‍each other. We all bring different levels of knowledge, understanding, skills, and advice, which makes ⁣us a strong team. It’s ⁢this ‌diversity that ⁣makes us unique.”\n\nCarver expressed confidence in her ability to ‍balance her responsibilities ⁢as director ‌of development with a potential role ‍on the school​ board.\n\n“Our city has so​ much to‌ offer and I’m fully committed here,”⁣ she said. “I understand that my role as the director of development is interconnected with the success ‍of our scholars. ⁢If‍ they succeed, ‌we all succeed.”\n\nCarver, a former ‌Democratic⁤ ward⁤ leader‌ in Albany, revealed that ⁢her decision to run for public⁢ office for the first time was driven by her desire to positively influence⁤ the district where‌ two of her three children are enrolled.\n\n“Their educational trajectory is ⁤my‌ top priority,” Carver said. ⁤“My goals are to stand with our teachers and​ educators to ensure that preventive and supportive services ⁣are​ available. I aim‌ to strengthen the‌ relationship between⁤ academics and the community, enhance partnerships with our community organizations, and foster⁤ a collaborative environment.”\n\nCavanagh, who retired ⁢as the Principal Office Assistant with the ⁤New York​ State Court of Claims, was ⁤motivated to run after learning about the district’s chronic absenteeism issues.\n\nThe district’s second quarter ​academic​ report released this spring ⁣revealed that each of its elementary schools saw⁤ drops in attendance between the first‌ and second‌ quarters of the 2023-2024 school year.​ Over half of​ district first and second‌ graders were deemed chronically absent in the second‍ quarter.\n\nCavanagh expressed⁤ her desire ‍to see the district offer civil service exam classes ‍for 11th grade students to secure jobs after graduation.\n\nShe also highlighted the⁣ district’s struggles with state test scores as a priority⁣ if she were ⁤elected. Despite making ‌incremental progress over the previous year, more than 83% of district students‍ in​ grades 3-8 were not proficient in 2023 state ⁤math scores.\n\n“I’m deeply concerned ‍that these kids aren’t learning,” Cavanagh ⁤said on​ Thursday. “They’re not thriving.‍ Not all, but most. Regardless of what the​ district does, or what buildings they ​buy, you can invest in anything you want. But until we have⁤ more kids‌ passing than not, they can ⁣come up ⁤with ⁤all sorts of ideas for buildings or more social⁤ workers. We need to understand why these kids aren’t learning. I believe they’re being distracted. They’re‌ learning ⁣a lot‍ in school, except for‌ reading,‍ writing, and arithmetic.”\n\nAt a candidate⁣ forum Thursday night hosted⁢ by⁢ the League of Women Voters held‌ at the district’s Liberty Street offices, the three ⁣candidates shared their visions for the‌ district and offered differing viewpoints on issues such as school resource officers (SRO), charter⁢ schools, and book banning in Schenectady schools. Cavanagh often expressed conservative viewpoints during the forum, while the ⁢progressive Miles frequently took opposing ⁣stances.\n\nFollowing unrelated incidents at Oneida Middle School in January and Mont Pleasant Middle School in April, the district launched an online safety survey ​asking students, staff, and residents how ​the district could improve its safety practices.\n\nDuring the Thursday forum, the ⁣candidates ⁢responded to a question about⁢ the effectiveness of the district’s SRO program that ‍places Schenectady‌ police officers in city schools.\n\nThe district initiated ⁣a pilot program in 2021 to bring a pair of community engagement officers into the district, with the⁢ school⁤ board subsequently approving a plan⁢ in 2022 to expand the program to six officers.\n\n“I ⁢believe that having officers in our‍ schools will also foster a⁣ connection within our community,” Carver⁢ said on Thursday. “We are aware of the negative narrative associated with ⁣our ​low-to-moderate-income families in our​ urban areas when it comes to our‌ police officers. Based on the studies I’ve read,⁢ our officers are building connections⁣ with the young people in⁤ our schools.”\n\nMiles expressed her​ concerns⁢ about the effectiveness of the SRO program.\n\n“The research clearly‍ shows that more police does not increase ⁤safety or foster an overall positive climate in our schools,” she said during⁣ the forum.\n\nMiles added that she supports the district’s school safety team of local residents who work within⁢ the buildings,⁤ wearing ⁢red shirts and guiding students throughout the day.\n\nCavanagh strongly endorsed the district’s SRO​ program.\n\n“The SROs⁢ are great,” she⁣ said after the forum. “They have to be there because of the situation across the country and in‍ the ⁣area. We’re finding kids with ​knives and guns and things like that. That’s unacceptable.”\n\nIn response to an audience question about the candidate’s‌ stances on charter schools, Miles argued that charter schools drain funds ‍from public​ schools.\n\n“I see them as a drain on public schools,” Miles said⁤ during the⁣ forum. “While they‍ are praised as a choice ⁣for ⁤parents, they actually take resources away ‍from our buildings.”\n\nCarver, whose children attended a charter school before the family moved to Schenectady, expressed ⁢a ⁢different view.\n\n“We should have options,” Carver said during the forum. ​“I’m not ⁤against charter schools.⁤ I understand they may drain some of ⁣the resources, but I believe there’s enough resources for our city to have options.”\n\nCavanagh supported ‍the idea of charter schools during the forum.\n\n“I’m for school choice,” ‍Cavanagh said ⁢on Thursday. “I believe in any ⁤school, whether ‌it’s private, public,‍ or a charter school,⁣ as ‍long​ as the value of the children’s education is upheld.”\n\nAn audience question about the candidate’s ⁣stances on banning books in Schenectady schools saw Miles ⁢and Carver both opposed to the‌ idea.\n\n“Our goal within our district is‌ to foster ⁣lifelong learning ⁢for⁣ these individuals ⁤and to help​ them become critical⁣ thinkers⁤ capable⁤ of making objective decisions,”‌ Miles said.\n\nCavanagh stated that she would support⁤ banning books under certain circumstances.\n\n“I have‍ no ⁢problem banning books that are inappropriate⁣ for age groups‍ that are too young to understand the information in the books,” Cavanagh said during the ⁢forum. “There are certain⁤ things you⁣ don’t understand until you’re older and you need a solid foundation of education and⁤ critical ⁣thinking‌ skills before you ​tackle different ⁢subjects.”\n\nThe seven-member Schenectady school board is composed entirely ‍of female ⁢members, with all three ⁤of ‍this year’s ⁤candidates being women ⁢of color.\n\n“We may‌ all be women, but we are very different women,” Miles ​said of ​the current board.‍ “The current structure is majority women of color and after the election, we’ll still be majority women​ of color ‌no‍ matter who wins, but ⁤we⁣ still have that diversity of views.”\n\nThe school board election and voting ⁢for the district’s proposed $277.7 million 2024-2025 ‍school budget will take place on ⁢Tuesday from noon to ‍9:00 p.m. at district polling locations.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/05/18/three-contenders-battle-for-two-positions-on-schenectady-school-board/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Take Two Cafe in Schenectady Marks Third Anniversary – Bite-Sized","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/4886-6646ab61aafa7.preview.jpg","content":"Welcome to our regular feature, ‌Bite-sized, where we bring you the latest updates on local food festivals, special events, menu updates, restaurant news,‍ and ‍more.

Meanwhile, in Utah, relatives ​assembled to grieve for Christian Malanga, the unconventional leader⁤ of the‌ audacious and doomed ‌assault on the presidential palace over the⁢ weekend.\n\nBrig. Gen. Sylvain Ekenge informed the Associated Press ⁢that the third American was Taylor Thomson. It ⁢was not​ immediately apparent whether⁤ Thomson was among those apprehended ‍or‌ killed on Sunday‌ morning following the assault on the palace and another on the residence of a close confidant of President Felix Tshisekedi.\n\nMalanga, characterized as a naturalized American ‍by Ekenge,​ was⁤ slain in ⁢a gunfight at the palace after resisting capture. The State Department⁤ stated⁢ it could not verify Malanga’s U.S. ⁣citizenship. The other two confirmed Americans involved were a convicted marijuana dealer, Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun, and Malanga’s 21-year-old‍ son, ⁢Marcel Malanga.\n\nOfficials were still attempting to unravel ⁤how ​Marcel Malanga transitioned from‍ playing high school football in Utah to allegedly attempting⁣ to overthrow the leader of one of Africa’s largest nations.\n\n“My son is innocent,” his mother, Brittney Sawyer, wrote‍ in an ⁤email to the Associated Press on Monday, declining ⁣to provide further details.\n\nSawyer had frequently shared ⁢cherished family ‌photos on social media, including one in December ​featuring Marcel‍ Malanga,‍ a young sister, and a⁤ toddler embracing in matching Christmas pajamas. In 2020, she posted ⁤photos⁢ of Marcel Malanga lifting weights and dancing during the COVID ‌lockdown.\n\nIn a Facebook post early Monday, Sawyer expressed her frustration that ​her son had⁤ followed his father. “This was an innocent boy following his father. I’m so⁣ tired of all ‌the videos being posted all over and being sent to me. (Expletive) will take care of you people!”\n\n‘Devastated’\n\nA video that made rounds on social ‍media over the weekend showed her‍ son next to a bloodied white man, whose identity was unclear, both covered in ⁢dust and surrounded by Congolese soldiers. Marcel ⁣Malanga had his hands raised and a terrified expression on his⁤ face.\n\nOn Monday, at the West Jordan home of Malanga’s mother,‍ Chantal Malanga, family members ⁤gathered ⁣to mourn the fallen leader. A constant stream of friends stopped by with‌ dishes of food and to extend their condolences.\n\nA cousin of Christian Malanga’s who answered the door told the Associated Press the family was feeling⁤ “devastated”⁣ and “so raw” after learning of his⁤ death. They were‍ discussing plans for a possible funeral in Utah, she said,​ without providing further⁤ details.\n\nIt was unclear how Malanga ​had enlisted the other Americans for his⁤ doomed assault on the Congolese state. His connection to Zalman-Polun, who‌ in 2015 pleaded guilty to trafficking marijuana, seemed to⁢ be through ‌a gold mining company that was established in Mozambique ‌in 2022, according​ to an official journal ⁣published by Mozambique’s government, and‌ a report by​ Africa⁣ Intelligence newsletter.\n\n‘I was not involved in this’\n\nAmerican businessman Cole Ducey, also named‌ as an official in‍ the mining company in the Mozambique journal, said he met Christian Malanga when the two were introduced by a mutual acquaintance a few years ago and briefly considered investing together in mining concessions⁣ in Mozambique. Ducey ⁤said he also met⁢ Zalman-Polun, whom Malanga had‍ met in⁣ Washington.\n\nDucey said‌ they never discussed the political situation in Congo or Malanga’s ambition⁢ to⁤ be part of the government there. Ducey said ​he eventually decided not to partner ⁢with the two men.\n\n“We simply viewed a couple mining​ concessions in Mozambique,” Ducey said of Malanga. “I didn’t⁣ know him very well but from what ⁣I gathered ⁤he wasn’t very intelligent.”\n\nHe said he had no contact with Malanga and Zalman-Polun ‌in about‌ two ⁣years and was shocked⁣ to ⁤read about their alleged involvement in a violent coup attempt.\n\n“I was ‌not involved in⁣ this and had nothing ⁢to do with it,” said Ducey, who was in Eswatini on Monday, referring to reports in the‍ Congolese media naming him among the attackers.\n\nAmbiguous plot\n\nThe alleged coup attempt began at the Kinshasa residence of Vital‍ Kamerhe, ⁣a federal legislator and​ a candidate for speaker of the National‌ Assembly of‌ Congo. His⁢ guards killed ⁤the attackers, officials said.\n\nMalanga,⁢ meanwhile, was live-streaming video from the presidential palace in which he is seen surrounded by several people in military uniforms ‌wandering around in the middle of the night. He was later ‌killed while resisting arrest,⁣ Congolese ‌authorities said.\n\nCongo officials have‌ not‍ commented on how ‍the attackers were able ⁢to gain entry.\n\nDino Mahtani, who worked in Congo for years as a journalist and then a political‌ adviser to the U.N.⁤ between 2015-18, told the Associated Press‌ that Malanga had likely been deceived or betrayed.\n\n“It’s really difficult to imagine how 20, 30 guys thought that by storming ‌the presidential palace when nobody is around at 4 a.m. in the morning could somehow take over the Congolese state,” he said. “It could be external plotters,​ but​ given his previous close relationship⁢ with at least one of Tshiskedi’s current military commanders, there’s some chance the plot was​ known about‌ internally.”","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/05/22/congo-identifies-third-american-involved-in-thwarted-coup-as-utah-mourners-pay-tribute-to-plot-leader/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Broadalbin Accident Victim Identified as Schenectady Man by Sheriff","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/4907-65399a6e2acca.image_.jpg","content":"BROADALBIN ‍- The identity⁢ of a Schenectady man who tragically lost his life in a car accident on Sunday evening in ⁢Broadalbin has been​ released by the ⁤Fulton County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nThe victim, John​ Widdemer, Jr., ​aged 60, was the‌ sole ‌casualty in the single-vehicle accident that occurred on ‌County Highway 126 in Broadalbin, according to official ‌reports.\n\nOriginally hailing from Gloversville, Widdemer was residing ⁣in Schenectady at the time of the unfortunate incident, officials confirmed.\n\nThe fatal accident occurred when Widdemer’s vehicle veered off ⁢County Highway 126, collided with a mailbox, traveled⁤ several hundred feet, and finally crashed ⁤into two‍ trees, as per the officials.\n\nThe emergency ⁤services received a distress call at 6:40 p.m. on Sunday. ‍The⁢ Broadalbin-Kennyetto⁤ Fire Department and Lake Valley EMS, along with other⁣ authorities, promptly responded ⁣to the scene.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the‍ incident ⁣is still being thoroughly investigated.\n\nThe Schenectady ⁤police, ⁤state police, and ⁣county‍ District Attorney Michael Poulin have⁢ all been actively involved in the ‍ongoing investigation.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/05/21/broadalbin-accident-victim-identified-as-schenectady-man-by-sheriff/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Inflation fears among America’s small businesses are rising again and their faith in the Fed is falling","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/4791-107385774-17101820702024-03-11t183300z_286094198_rc2uj6anix0t_rtrmadp_0_usa-election-biden-1068x601.jpeg","content":"The fight against inflation was going well for the Federal Reserve and economy for much of last year and into 2024, but one important demographic remained unconvinced about the progress being made in lowering pricing: small business owners.\n\nNow, more influential parties are coming around to a view that small businesses have been stubborn in saying is closer to the on-the-ground truth: inflation isn’t coming down fast enough. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell conceded that after three months of disappointing data on inflation, there has been a “lack of further progress” this year. Market traders, who not long ago were in interest rate cut euphoria mode and forecasting up to six rate cuts by the Fed this year, are now more likely to see one or two cuts at most.\n\nDisappointment over inflation is nothing new for small business owners, and their frustration over high prices is increasing again, according to the WHNY News|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey for Q2 2024.\n\nOne in four (24%) small business owners tell WHNY News that they think inflation has reached a peak, down from 29% in the previous quarter, and back to where the economic sentiment reading was a year ago. The percentage of small business owners who expect inflation to rise from here is trending up as well — 75% this quarter, up from 69% in Q1.\n\n“Small business owners are the engine of our economy, and the data shows they are still pessimistic about overcoming inflation,” Lara Belonogoff, senior director of brand management and research at SurveyMonkey, said in a statement upon the Q2 survey’s release.\n\nThis WHNY News|SurveyMonkey online poll was conducted April 8-12, 2024 among a national sample of 2,130 self-identified small business owners ages 18 and up.\n\nDespite a positive market reaction to Fed Chair Powell’s comments after the FOMC meeting on Wednesday — in the least, Powell all but ruled out another rate hike this year — small business confidence in the Fed has declined. Last quarter, a little over one-third (35%) of business owners said they had confidence in the Fed. That’s not fallen back to 31%, where it was in Q2 of last year.\n\n“Inflation remains a top concern, clearly, for small businesses,” said U.S. Small Business Administration head Isabel Casillas Guzman in an interview with WHNY News’s Kate Rogers at the virtual Small Business Playbook event on Thursday. “We’ve tried to make sure the SBA is more readily available to credit worthy borrowers out there. Half of businesses don’t get the capital they need fully, or at all.”\n\nShe suggested small business owners start with local SBA resource partners, local district offices, which can connect them with lenders on the ground, as well as starting with the SBA’s online Lender Match tool.\n\nOne finding over which small businesses are in line with a broader macro view is the overall state of the economy. Over one-quarter (27%) describe the economy as “excellent or good,” which has not trended lower even as inflation fears have picked back up. It’s also notably up from 21% in the year-ago quarterly survey. The economy’s performance helps explain why nearly three times as many business owners cite inflation as the biggest risk they face (37%) compared to the No. 2 threat, consumer demand, at 13%.\n\nSBA Administrator Guzman cited the 17.2 million new business applications filed during the Biden administration as a sign of the economic optimism despite inflation. She pointed to the Biden legislation that is spurring government spending on infrastructure and clean energy, which are economic growth drivers. “These are all small business trades across those opportunities,” she said. “That’s the economic growth the president has been focused on.”\n\nIncreasingly, though, it’s also a fiscal policy-linked spending plan and rise in federal debt that economists are tying to sticky inflation.\n\nThe WHNY News|SurveyMonkey Small Business Confidence Index was unmoved quarter-over-quarter, at 47 out of 100, and up one point from Q2 of last year.\n\nThe WHNY News|SurveyMonkey data is consistent with other recent small business survey findings. Goldman Sachs’ 10,000 Small Businesses Voices survey released this week cited 71% of small business owners saying inflationary pressures have increased on their businesses over the past three months and 49% saying they’ve had to raise the prices. In the WHNY News survey, 48% said they are raising prices.\n\nInflation will loom large in how America’s small business owners tilt in the presidential election.\n\nInflation is the No. 1 issue over which small business owners say they will vote, with 63% of survey respondents citing it, followed by economic growth at 61%.\n\nConfidence in President Biden’s handling of the presidency — which is typically low in a small business demographic that skews conservative — remains underwater in the new survey, at 31%, down by two percentage points quarter over quarter. Among Republican small business owners taking the survey, 5% approve of the job Biden is doing. Among Democrats, 82% of small businesses approve of Biden, though pollsters say that approval ratings under 90% within one’s own party are a signal of dissatisfaction.\n\nBiden has made some gains with his supporters, with the overall Small Business Confidence Index reading among this survey subset unchanged quarter over quarter at 61, and up from 55 in Q3 of 2023.\n\nThe WHNY News survey found that in one area, small business owners who identify as either Republicans or Democrats do reach a rare point of consensus: both say that when it comes to government policy, they are getting slighted compared to large corporations.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs survey found that 55% of business owners are unhappy with the amount of focus small business issues get from candidates. Inflation, at 73%, was the issue cited most frequently.\n\nGuzman said that the SBA has doubled the number of small-dollar loans, including to startups, as well as to women and people of color, who she noted are starting businesses at the highest rates. She also said more of the government loan volume is going into “rural banking deserts.”\n\nAnd the total amount of government contracts going to small businesses has reached 28%, Guzman said, roughly $178 billion, according to the recent government scorecard. “We want more people to do business with the largest buyer in the world,” she said. ","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/05/03/inflation-fears-among-americas-small-businesses-are-rising-again-and-their-faith-in-the-fed-is-falling/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Successful start-up founders offer advice for aspiring entrepreneurs: ‘Embrace what makes you different’","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4734-107403425-1713464843756-JA_Denver_-1068x601.jpg","content":"The Junior Achievement Free Enterprise Center located in Greenwood Village, Colorado, is where high school students can explore careers and develop a plan to pursue their goals. The center aims to inspire the next generation of entrepreneurs.\n\nEntrepreneurship is a common goal for younger people.\n\nMore than half, or 54%, of Gen Z adults say that they think they’d be happier owning their own business than working a normal day job, according to WHNY News and SurveyMonkey’s new Workforce Survey. The survey polled 5,993 U.S. adults in the workforce in early April — including 770 Gen Z respondents age 27 and younger.\n\nMore from Your Money:\n\nHere’s a look at more stories on how to manage, grow and protect your money for the years ahead.\n\nWith a good credit score, ‘doors will open.’ But many face a roadblock\n100-year-old still has $1 million saved: ‘I always lived within my means’\nMiddle-class Americans want to know how the wealthy make money\n\n“There’s a recipe for finding your path to purpose,” said Robin Wise, the president and CEO of Junior Achievement Rocky Mountain. “It’s seeing people do things that you might want to do. It’s knowing yourself.” \n\nIn partnership with Junior Achievement, WHNY News brought together business leaders in the Denver area to speak with students about their journey in founding a company. Here are five key pieces of advice that they shared:\n\n‘Embrace what makes you different’ \n\nDarian Simon co-founded the clothing company Be a Good Person in 2015 to inspire positivity. He advises young people to “embrace what makes you different.”\n\nSimon was diagnosed with autism and ADHD, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, at age 28. Now 30, he said he rejects the “disorder” part of the diagnosis and embraces it as his superpower.\n\n“My greatest strengths are my neurodivergence because I have less inhibitive space in my brain, therefore I can ideate better,” he said. “Therefore the box doesn’t really exist in the same ways.”\n\nValue adaptability\n\nRobin Thurston sold his digital fitness technology start-up to Under Armour for $150 million in 2013. He recently founded Outside Interactive, a network of media brands in endurance sports, the outdoors and healthy living.\n\nHe compares starting a business to going on a difficult hike and advises keeping that analogy in mind as you embark on the journey — you’ll need to embrace the unknown, recognize that things are unlikely to go according to plan and work through inevitable difficulties, he said.\n\n“That’s what great entrepreneurs do,” Thurston said. “They’re resilient, and they work their way through those challenges.” \n\nRecognize challenges ‘as opportunities’\n\nCamila Uzcategui co-founded Vitro3D, a company that uses 3D printing-like technology in advanced manufacturing spaces, in 2020. She said her background in physics and interest in experimenting with technology taught her the value of failure. \n\n“In all of those challenges, I like to see them as opportunities to either pivot into a potentially new direction or pivot into a better way of understanding something,” Uzcategui said.\n\nExpect excellence from your team\n\nMowa Haile founded Sky Blue Builders, a construction company, during the Great Recession in 2009. He said it’s important to surround yourself with people who share your passion — and always expect excellence from them.  \n\n“When you’re an entrepreneur and you have a team, you’re there to coach them and lead them and encourage them,” he said. \n\nSurround yourself with the right people\n\nLara Merriken founded Larabar, a company that makes vegan, gluten-free, plant-based bars, in 2000 after a career in social work.\n\n“A lot of people were literally naysayers,” she recalled. “They were just like, why would you do this? Why would you get into a category that’s oversaturated?” \n\nShe said that identifying and working with trusted confidants who were supportive and encouraging were critical to the company’s success. She sold Larabar to General Mills in 2008 for about $55 million. \n\nAnother recipe for success is to learn from other entrepreneurs’ stories, Merriken said. “While we have our companies, we still need inspiration every day.”\n\nSIGN UP: Money 101 is an 8-week learning course to financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox.\n\nDon’t miss these exclusives from WHNY News PRO\nHere are Wednesday’s biggest analyst calls: Tesla, Amazon, Airbnb, Domino’s, Walmart, Disney & more\nForget Nvidia: Morgan Stanley says Intel’s much-hyped AI chip will boost 3 global stocks \nAnalysts love this gold explorer’s stock — and even the most cautious expect it to soar 114%\nBank of America upgrades Tesla, says first-quarter report opens door for strong gains ahead \nThis biotech stock specializing in targeted cancer treatments can surge 50%, Jefferies says\nHere’s where to invest $1 million right now, according to the pros ","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/04/25/successful-start-up-founders-offer-advice-for-aspiring-entrepreneurs-embrace-what-makes-you-different/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Small business optimism hits 11-year low as inflation fears won’t go away","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4612-107396717-1712232017285-gettyimages-2136931160-_dsc3973-1068x601.jpeg","content":"Small business confidence hit its lowest level in more than 11 years for March as proprietors worried that inflation is still very much a problem.\n\nAt a time when other data points show inflation receding, the National Federation of Independent Business reported Tuesday that its survey showed a reading of 88.5, down nearly a point from February and the lowest since December 2012.\n\nA quarter of all respondents reported that rising costs were the biggest problem.\n\n“Small business optimism has reached the lowest level since 2012 as owners continue to manage numerous economic headwinds,” NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said. “Inflation has once again been reported as the top business problem on Main Street and the labor market has only eased slightly.”\n\nA quarter of all respondents cited inflation, and in particular higher input and labor costs, as their most pressing issue. A net 28% reported raising average selling prices for the month and 33% planned additional price hikes, according to seasonally adjusted data.\n\nAs part of those escalating costs, a net 38% said they raised compensation, up 3 percentage points from the February reading that was the lowest since May 2021. The Labor Department on Friday reported that average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in March and 4.1% from a year ago.\n\nThe survey comes with other indicators showing that inflation, while not eradicated, is at least receding.\n\nA Commerce Department measurement of personal consumption expenditures prices put the annual inflation rate at 2.5% in February. The measurement, which the Federal Reserve uses as its main inflation gauge, showed a 2.8% level when excluding food and energy, which policymakers prefer as a better sign of longer-run trends.\n\nThe consumer price index, a more widely watched figure by the public, will be released Wednesday and is expected to show a 3.4% headline rate and 3.7% on core. Fed policymakers target 2% annual inflation.\n\nInflation expectations have been fairly well-anchored in recent months. A New York Fed survey on Monday showed respondents for March expected a 3% rate over the next year, unchanged from February. The three-year outlook rose slightly but the five-year expectation decreased.\n\nHowever, the survey did show a big jump in the expectations for rent increases — by 8.7% over the next year, a 2.6 percentage point surge from February. Declining shelter inflation is at the core of the Fed’s thesis that inflation will continue to ebb toward the central bank’s 2% target, allowing for interest rate cuts later in the year.\n\nFed survey respondents also said they expect prices to rise substantially for most other major components. They see gas prices up 4.5% in the next year and food up 5.1%, both 0.2 percentage points higher than the February survey.\n\nDon’t miss these stories from WHNY News PRO:\nFive stocks to buy and hold for the long term, according to the pros\nThese are Piper Sandler’s favorite stocks for the second quarter \nEnergy might be the ‘story of the summer,’ one chief investment officer says.

Ireland is set to mandate cancer warning labels on alcohol from 2026.\n\n“The scientific consensus has evolved due to the compelling evidence associating alcohol with over 200 health conditions, such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases,‌ and injuries,” commented Carina Ferreira-Borges, the regional adviser for alcohol at the World Health Organization regional​ office for Europe.\n\nWith initiatives like Dry​ January and Sober‌ October, and bartenders innovating with non-alcoholic cocktails, there’s a growing cultural shift towards reducing alcohol intake.\n\n“People in my age group are much more open to the idea,” shared Tessa Weber, a ⁣28-year-old from Austin, Texas. She decided to participate in Dry January this year after noticing ⁤that alcohol was exacerbating her anxiety. She was pleased with the results — improved sleep, increased energy — and has decided to continue ‍with her reduced alcohol ‌intake.\n\n“It’s beneficial to reassess your⁣ relationship with alcohol,” Weber added.\n\nPrevious ⁢studies that suggested benefits of moderate drinking were flawed, often comparing groups based on their drinking habits at ⁣a single point in time. These studies did not randomly assign participants to drink or abstain, making it impossible ⁤to establish a cause-effect relationship.\n\nDr. Naimi pointed out that moderate drinkers often have higher education levels, higher ⁣incomes, and better access to healthcare. “When you account for these factors, the supposed benefits of moderate drinking ⁢vanish,” ⁤he explained.\n\nAnother issue with these studies is that they often excluded younger participants. Nearly half of the deaths from alcohol-related causes occur before the age of 50.\n\n“If you’re only studying individuals who have survived into middle age, haven’t quit drinking due to problems, and haven’t become‍ heavy⁤ drinkers,‌ you’re looking at a very specific group,” Naimi said. “This creates ⁤a false impression of benefits for moderate drinkers, which is essentially a⁣ statistical mirage.”\n\nOther research contradicts the notion⁤ that alcohol has health benefits. These studies compare individuals with a gene variant that makes drinking unpleasant to those without the variant. Those with the variant tend‍ to⁢ drink very little or not at all. One such study found that individuals⁣ with⁢ the⁤ gene ‌variant have a lower risk of heart disease, further debunking the myth that alcohol protects against heart issues.\n\nAlcohol consumption‍ increases the risk of several types of cancer, including colon, liver, breast, and mouth and throat. Alcohol metabolizes into a substance called acetaldehyde in the ‌body, which can harm cells and prevent them from repairing themselves, creating an environment conducive to cancer growth.\n\nDr. Naimi suggests that thousands of U.S. deaths could be prevented annually if people adhered to the government’s dietary guidelines, which ‍recommend men to limit themselves to two or fewer drinks per day ⁤and women‌ to one or fewer.\n\nOne drink is typically equivalent⁣ to ‌a 12-ounce can of beer, a 5-ounce glass of wine, or a shot of liquor.\n\nNaimi was part of an⁢ advisory committee that proposed lowering the recommendation for men to one drink ⁣per day. However, this advice was overlooked when the federal recommendations were published in 2020.\n\n“The‍ most straightforward message, backed by evidence, is that ⁤if you choose to drink, less is ​better for​ your⁤ health,” Naimi concluded.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical ​Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/04/29/new-study-suggests-improved-health-through-reduced-or-eliminated-alcohol-consumption/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Biden announces intention to face Trump in debate","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4751-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"NEW YORK — In‍ a recent‌ announcement, President​ Joe Biden confirmed his willingness to engage in a ⁢debate with his Republican adversary from the November election, former President Donald Trump.\n\n“I am ready, although the exact timing is ​yet to be determined,”‌ the Democratic president shared during an interview with ‌renowned broadcaster Howard⁤ Stern. ⁢”I am more than willing to engage in a debate with him.”\n\nThis statement marks Biden’s‌ most explicit ‍confirmation yet ⁢regarding the possibility of a presidential ⁤debate.

The ‍bill could ‌potentially affect more than just TikTok, as it ​empowers the executive branch to identify other companies that meet the specified criteria for posing a threat to ⁤national security and ​enforce‌ a sale.\n\nSen. ⁤Maria‍ Cantwell, D-Wash.,⁢ expressed to The Wall Street Journal her openness ‌to prolonging the timeframe stipulated in the bill, currently set ⁢at six ‌months. This could “provide the opportunity to actually execute a transaction and⁣ perhaps achieve ⁢a⁢ bit more, not ‍stability, but identify the ⁣appropriate divestiture,” she shared ⁤with the publication.\n\nIt remains uncertain how much the Senate’s version of the​ bill will deviate from the one the House passed earlier this ⁤year. ​The ⁣bill received ​bipartisan support, ⁣including from Utah’s House delegation,‍ but has ​encountered more ​opposition in the ⁤Senate, with criticisms ranging from First Amendment concerns to issues⁤ regarding ⁤the amount of ‌authority it would grant the executive branch.\n\nAs it currently stands, the ⁢House’s version of the⁤ bill would delegate authority to the executive ‌branch to determine if an app poses a threat to national ⁢security based on certain criteria and enforce a sale ⁣of ‍the app.⁢ Critics of the bill,⁣ including ⁣Sen.

However, the recall solution does ⁢not involve fixing the fuel leaks.\n\nThe recall pertains to‌ specific Bronco Sport SUVs from the 2022 and ⁣2023⁣ model years, as well ⁤as 2022 Escape SUVs. All ⁢the‍ affected vehicles are equipped with 1.5-liter engines.\n\nAccording to documents submitted to U.S. safety regulators, Ford has identified that fuel injectors⁢ can crack, leading to gasoline or vapor accumulation near ignition sources. ⁢This could potentially ignite ‌fires.\n\nAs a ‍remedy, dealers will install a tube to direct gasoline away from hot surfaces, allowing it to flow to the ground beneath ​the vehicle.​ Additionally, they will update the engine control software to detect ​any pressure drop in the fuel injection system. If ​such a situation arises,‌ the software will disable the high-pressure​ fuel pump, reduce engine ⁤power, and ​lower engine‍ compartment temperatures. This information was made public on Wednesday via​ the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website.\n\nVehicle ​owners were expected to receive notification letters starting April 1.\n\nAccording​ to ⁢Ford’s documents, there have been five reported under-hood ⁢fires and 14 warranty ⁣replacements of fuel injectors. However, there have been no​ reports of accidents or ⁣injuries.\n\nIn a statement, Ford clarified that it is not⁢ replacing fuel injectors as⁢ it⁣ believes the recall​ repairs “will prevent the failure⁤ from occurring and protect the customer.” The updated software ​will also activate a dashboard warning light, enabling customers to drive to ‌a safe location, stop⁣ the vehicle, and arrange for service. Ford’s documents ‍indicate that ‍the problem only⁤ affects‍ about 1% of the SUVs.\n\nFurthermore, Ford has announced that⁣ it will extend warranty coverage‌ for cracked fuel injectors. This means that owners who encounter this problem will⁢ receive​ replacements. Ford has confirmed⁢ that repairs are already available, and ⁤details of the extended warranty will be released in June.\n\nThis ⁣recall is an⁣ extension ⁤of a 2022 recall​ for the‌ same issue. The​ repair has‍ been tested on vehicles involved in the previous recall, and Ford has ‍reported no known issues.\n\nDespite the potential ‌fire risk, Ford is not advising that the SUVs be parked exclusively outdoors‌ as there is no evidence to‌ suggest that fires occur when⁣ vehicles are parked with the engines off.\n\nMichael ‌Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, criticized⁤ Ford’s solution⁣ for the fuel leaks as a “Band-Aid type recall.” He suggested that the company is trying to sidestep the cost of repairing the fuel injectors.\n\nBrooks pointed⁤ out that a 1% failure rate is significant. Even with the proposed repairs, ⁣drivers could still be⁢ forced to exit a freeway at a low speed, potentially putting them at risk ‍of an accident.\n\nHe urged the safety administration​ to‍ do more to ⁤ensure recalls address the root ⁤causes of vehicle ⁤problems, rather than opting for less expensive repairs.\n\nPreviously, the safety board has stated that it does not have the legal authority to pre-approve recall fixes. However, ‌in a statement released on Wednesday, the agency said⁣ it ‍will‍ “closely track their ⁤performance using field data.” The agency advised owners with questions to contact their dealership​ or Ford.\n\nBrooks called ​on‌ Congress to amend ⁢the law so the agency can ‍”require something more ⁢than the rubber stamp that⁢ NHTSA is currently deploying” ‍on recalls.\n\nHe noted that the​ agency has recently been⁣ more proactive in investigating recall fixes. “That is a post-remedy inquiry that won’t make ‌the fixes better, and further stretches out the process and leaves consumers in limbo,” he added.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/04/11/ford-issues-recall-for-almost-43000-suvs-over-fire-risk-from-gas-leaks-but-solution-wont-address-leaks/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Biden might not meet Ohio ballot deadline","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4609-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"From the heart of⁤ SALT LAKE⁤ CITY, a unique challenge has emerged for President Joe Biden‍ regarding his ⁢potential candidacy⁤ in Ohio‍ for the 2024 elections. The state’s law presents a conundrum that⁢ requires either an early certification of Biden as the Democratic candidate for 2024, two weeks ahead of the ⁤planned schedule,​ or a special exception from ⁣the Ohio ⁣Legislature.\n\nOhio’s Secretary of⁣ State, Frank LaRose, penned a letter‌ to Liz Walters, the Chairwoman of the‍ Ohio​ Democratic Party, outlining these concerns.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention, where Biden is expected to be officially declared as the nominee, is set to take ⁤place on August 19. However, ⁢Ohio’s law stipulates that candidates must be certified by August 7.\n\nLaRose’s letter, which was first made public by ABC News, stated, “Therefore, pending further clarification, I am left⁣ to conclude that the Democratic‌ National Committee ⁣must either move ⁤up its‌ nominating ‍convention or the Ohio General Assembly must ⁣act by May 9, 2024 (90 days prior to ⁢a new law’s​ effective ⁣date) to create an exception to this statutory requirement.”\n\nThe letter further urged the⁤ Democratic Party officials to provide a solution that aligns with the state law in a timely manner to the​ office of the secretary of state.\n\nA spokesperson for the Biden ‍campaign, in a statement to NBC News, said that they are “monitoring the situation in Ohio,” and expressed ​confidence‌ that‌ “Joe Biden will be on the ballot in all​ 50 states.”\n\nIt’s important⁣ to note that⁤ the Republican Party holds‍ the ⁢majority ⁤in both chambers of Ohio’s state Legislature, making it difficult ​to ⁣extend the deadline. Holding the convention earlier could also lead to logistical challenges. These factors could ⁢potentially result in Biden being left off the ‍2024 ballot⁣ in Ohio.\n\nAs reported‌ by the Associated Press, the state had⁢ temporarily altered the rules before the 2020 presidential election, when both the⁢ Republican‌ and Democratic conventions were scheduled after the state’s ​certification ⁢deadline.

In 2023,‌ the agency proposed a ban on its sale for other consumer⁣ uses and many industrial and commercial uses, Doa ⁢said. However, food‍ uses regulated by the ‍FDA under ⁣the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act remain.\n\nThe Environmental Defense Fund and ⁢its co-petitioners argue that the ⁢FDA, by⁢ allowing ‍methylene chloride in food, is “disregarding” a⁣ 66-year-old amendment to the federal act known as⁢ the Delaney Clause. This clause ⁤mandates the FDA to ban food additives proven ⁤to cause or induce cancer when ingested by humans or animals.\n\n“Thus, these chemicals categorically‌ cannot and should not‌ be deemed as safe,” Doa stated.\n\nAn FDA spokesperson said in⁣ a‍ statement that the FDA is currently reviewing the petitions but does not comment on them while they are under review.\n\nHere’s what experts and the FDA say about this clause in the modern context, and what you should know about the safety of decaf coffee.\n\nWhat we know about methylene chloride\n\nThe FDA has one regulation permitting the use of methylene chloride as a solvent to decaffeinate coffee, stipulating that “the residues of methylene chloride must not exceed 10 parts per million (0.001%) in decaffeinated roasted coffee and in decaffeinated soluble coffee extract (instant coffee).”\n\nAn FDA spokesperson said via email, “While methylene chloride may be indirectly involved in food processing, such as in the decaffeination of coffee beans, residue limits have been set to limit exposure.‍ Any ⁣food product that contains residues of⁣ methylene chloride above the established limits are not permitted for sale or‍ consumption.”\n\nWilliam ⁢Murray, President and CEO ​of the National Coffee Association,‌ argued that banning European Method decaf coffee — the type that uses methylene chloride — “would defy science and harm American’s⁣ health.”\n\n“There⁢ is no evidence that European⁣ Method ‍decaf presents any risk,” he added via ‍email. “Indeed, the overwhelming weight of independent‌ scientific evidence shows that drinking European Method⁢ decaf, like all coffee, is associated with decreased⁤ risk of multiple⁤ cancers and with other significant health benefits.”\n\nHowever, Doa countered that the FDA’s last decision ‌on the chemical’s use for coffee “is decades old and clearly outdated.”\n\n‘There still isn’t a‌ lot of clear or conclusive research’\n\nMonique Richard, a registered dietitian nutritionist ‍and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, ‍a private practice in Tennessee,⁢ noted that many people‍ today consume larger portions⁣ of beverages or food than the smaller⁢ standard sizes⁢ of decades ago.⁤ For instance, while a standard cup of coffee ​was once 5 or 8 ounces, the​ smallest size at your local coffee shop today is ⁣likely 12 ounces.\n\n“But there still isn’t a lot of clear or conclusive research that ingesting residual levels⁤ in coffee specifically⁤ will cause cancer or other problems,” said Richard, who wasn’t involved in the petitions.\n\nHowever, she added, “we certainly want to be⁢ obviously proactive and be aware of some of these things.”\n\nResearch on what the human body can ⁣handle in terms of⁤ toxic load is evolving. Scientists are learning more about genetic disposition and gene ​expression, which ‌can provide information about what​ cells can tolerate in terms ‌of an assault on‍ the ⁣body. “So it may be less about what’s actually in your coffee, but what other factors are affecting your body?” Richard asked. “Even a ⁤’minute’ amount could⁣ be significantly destructive on a cellular level, over time,” she added.\n\nWhile methylene chloride has long been commonly used in ⁤the decaf industry, some‌ companies have introduced alternative methods or stopped using it entirely.\n\nWhat⁣ you‌ can do now\n\nThe decision on whether or not the FDA will eventually ban methylene chloride could take years.\n\nHowever, if you want to avoid potential methylene chloride exposure, when buying decaf coffee, look for product packaging with labels such as solvent-free,‌ Swiss Water processed or⁣ certified organic, Doa advised.\n\n“As a consumer, always do your research,” ‍Richard suggested. “Look up what you​ can about the company. Ask those⁢ questions if you can get on a customer hotline on their website.”\n\nAlso‍ consider⁤ how often ‍you’re drinking decaf coffee, how much⁤ and why, she added.\n\n“If you’re concerned about that and you just are confused, there’s lots of substitutes that are caffeine-free,” Richard said. These include beverages made from chicory root, figs and barley, dandelion root, mushroom elixirs, cacao, ⁢rooibos and yerba maté.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/04/06/fda-to-investigate-the-safety-of-drinking-decaf-coffee/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Final USS Arizona Survivor from Pearl Harbor Assault, Lou Conter, Passes Away at 102","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4579-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"HONOLULU ⁢— The ‌last remaining ​survivor of the USS Arizona, the naval warship ​that was‍ tragically⁣ sunk during the unexpected Japanese assault on Pearl Harbor, Lou Conter, has passed away at the age‍ of 102.

His peaceful passing‌ on​ Monday was confirmed by Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam and Pacific Historic Parks, quoting Conter’s daughter, Louann Daley.\n\nConter dedicated his life to ensuring the public never ‌forgot the⁣ devastating⁢ bombing. Through interviews, a ⁢published book, and by attending memorial services, he kept the memory of the attack alive. The bombing had ‌catapulted the battleship 30-40 feet out of the water, leaving many survivors with severe injuries.\n\nAs a 20-year-old quartermaster, Conter ⁣played a ⁢crucial role⁢ in rescuing his fellow crewmen on the fateful morning of Dec.‌ 7, 1941. This‍ event⁢ marked ⁤the ‌U.S.’s ‌entry into World⁣ War II.\n\nIn⁤ his ‍autobiography, “The Lou Conter Story: From USS Arizona Survivor to Unsung American Hero,” Conter recounted the horrifying moment when​ a Japanese armor-piercing bomb hit one million pounds of ⁤gunpowder stored in ‍the ship’s hull. He was on the USS Arizona deck at ⁤the time.\n\nConter shared his harrowing experiences with CNN ​affiliate KCRA ⁣in an interview⁣ last year. “Guys were‌ coming out of⁤ the fire, and we were just grabbing them and laying them down,” he said. “They were real bad. You​ would pick them ⁣up by the bodies,‍ and the skin would come off your hands.”\n\nThe attack lasted for an hour and 15 minutes, claiming the lives of approximately 2,400 US service members​ and civilians, and injuring over 1,100 people, as per a National WWII Museum‌ facts report ‍and other sources.\n\nConter was one of the 335 Arizona crew⁤ members who survived the attack. He outlived them all, including Ken Potts, the second to the‍ last⁤ survivor, ​who passed away last ⁤year ‍in Provo, at age 102, as‌ reported by‌ Pacific Historic Parks, which supports the USS Arizona Memorial and other ⁣sites.\n\nAileen Utterdyke, president and CEO of⁤ Pacific Historic Parks, expressed her sorrow over ⁣Conter’s passing.⁢ “This is a heartbreaking loss,” she said. “Lou Conter embodied the spirit⁤ of the Greatest Generation, a group of Americans ⁤whose collective bravery, achievements, and sacrifices ⁢saved our nation from ‍oppression.”\n\nUtterdyke praised Conter’s distinguished Navy career and his commitment to reminding schools, parents, and everyday Americans to always remember ‍Pearl Harbor. Funeral arrangements for the veteran are currently pending, the organization said.\n\nFollowing the Pearl​ Harbor attack, Conter’s military service​ expanded, and he became a VP-11 Black Cat pilot, as stated ‍by Pacific Historic Parks. The Black Cats conducted‌ operations under the cover of ⁢darkness, ⁢hidden from enemy ships.\n\nConter flew⁤ several ⁤missions with the Black Cats and survived two shootdowns during World War II, including one off the coast of ⁢New Guinea where‍ the crew was⁣ surrounded by sharks, according to ​Pacific Historic Parks.\n\nAfter World War II, Conter​ transitioned into an intelligence officer role, flying combat missions in Korea. He was highly respected in the military ⁤intelligence ‍community and was ‍instrumental in creating the Navy’s‍ first survival, evasion, resistance, and escape program, according to the National WWII ​Museum in New Orleans.\n\nConter also served as a⁤ military adviser to Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, and Lyndon B. Johnson, as reported by Pacific Historic Parks.\n\nAfter 28 years of dedicated service, Conter retired in​ December 1967, according to the National WWII Museum.\n\nWhen Conter turned 100, he pinned the pilot ⁢wings he’d earned in⁢ World War II on his 29-year-old great-nephew, U.S. Marine Capt. Ray Daniel Hower.‍ Although Conter was unable⁤ to attend the​ ceremony, Hower⁢ acknowledged in his keynote speech ⁤that the freedom, opportunity, and prosperity we enjoy today would ⁢not be possible without Conter’s service and heroism.\n\nConter was born in northern Wisconsin in 1921 and was the middle child ⁣in his family, according to the National WWII Museum.

Interestingly, the total miles driven ⁢in 2023 exceeded pre-pandemic levels for the first time.\n\nExperts suggest that the perceived ⁤decrease in ‌traffic policing during the COVID-19 pandemic may have led ⁢to riskier driving behaviors. As roads became⁤ less congested, some drivers may have felt less likely to receive traffic citations, leading to an increase​ in reckless driving.\n\nIn 2021, U.S. traffic fatalities ⁢saw a shocking 10.5% increase, reaching 42,915 – the highest number of deaths on American⁣ roads in a single ​year since 2005.\n\nThe NHTSA also reported a slight increase ⁤in pedestrian fatalities in 2022, with a 0.7% ⁤rise ‌to 7,522 – the highest number since 1981.

Instead⁤ of automatically deducting 100% of the overpayment from⁢ the monthly benefits of recipients, ​the agency will now only collect 10% — or ‌$10, whichever is higher — to recover the overpayment.\n\nExceptions to this rule will be few and far between, ‌and will primarily apply in ​cases where the overpayment was a result of⁢ fraudulent activities.\n\n“We​ are taking a crucial step towards achieving ​our objective of ensuring that our overpayment policies are​ just, balanced, ​and do not ⁤cause undue hardship to anyone,” stated Social Security Commissioner Martin O’Malley. “It’s unthinkable that someone could face homelessness or be unable to pay their bills because Social⁤ Security withheld their​ entire payment to recover an overpayment.”\n\nThis policy change⁣ will apply to new overpayments. However, those who are currently having more⁤ than‌ 10% of their benefits withheld can reach⁢ out to the⁤ Social Security Administration to discuss the possibility of reducing the rate.\n\nBeneficiaries who wish to have a rate lower than 10% will be approved if the overpayment can be recovered within 60 months. This ‌is a significant extension from the previous deadline​ of‍ 36 months.\n\nThe Social Security Administration has recently faced criticism for mistakenly overpaying beneficiaries and then aggressively ‍reclaiming the funds. This issue has​ been⁢ highlighted by several media outlets and was the subject of a hearing by a House Ways and Means subcommittee last ⁢fall.\n\n“Improper payments,⁢ many of which ‌are not⁤ the fault of the recipients, do indeed impose a ⁤heavy burden on them,” stated Georgia Rep.

Burgess Owens, a Republican⁤ from‍ Utah, likened diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives to ‌”a deeply-rooted malignancy within the heart of American academia.”\n\nThe hearing,⁤ dubbed “Polarizing, ⁣Excessive,⁢ Ineffective: The True Consequences of DEI ⁣on University Campuses,” was chaired⁣ by Owens, who also heads the House Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Development. The⁤ discussion revolved around the effects of DEI initiatives on ⁢medical institutions and the ⁤issue ⁣of ‍antisemitism in universities.\n\nIn his ​introductory remarks, Owens expressed ⁢his belief that these initiatives foster a ⁣”distorted perspective” of America, portraying the nation as “a hierarchy built on racial oppressors and the racially oppressed.”\n\nThis congressional hearing follows closely‍ on the heels​ of the Utah Legislature’s decision to revamp DEI initiatives‌ in public institutions, ‌encompassing universities, schools, and other ⁢state entities.\n\nThe newly enacted‌ law, ‌signed by Utah Gov. Spencer ⁢Cox on Jan. 30, mandates training for university employees on the importance of free speech and the conduction of climate surveys, ⁤the findings of which must ‌be disclosed to lawmakers. The state ‍reserves the⁤ right to withhold funding if institutions fail to comply with these requirements.\n\nAt the congressional hearing in Washington, Owens, who represents Utah’s ⁤4th District, ⁤stated, “DEI bureaucrats are employed not merely to regulate conversations but also to suppress free speech and ⁤open dialogue by exerting influence over every aspect of university administration, personnel, curriculum policy,‍ and college admissions.”\n\nPartisan Disagreement‌ over the Purpose of the Program\n\nOwens argued that these programs encourage ‌Black Americans to⁢ view their race as “feeble” and to “anticipate the promise of slavery reparations.” He further stated that DEI initiatives⁣ suggest that Black Americans, like himself, who demonstrate the determination and resilience to succeed, ⁢are outliers rather than the norm.\n\n“DEI is both belittling and racist,” Owens declared, citing ‌the silencing of scholars who ⁢dare to challenge it.\n\nOwens highlighted the⁣ financial burden‌ of DEI initiatives across the nation: $30 million annually at the University ‌of Michigan, $20‍ million at ‍Ohio State, $16 million at the University of Western Wisconsin, ⁢and $11 million‍ at Texas A&M.\n\n“What is the outcome?” Owens queried. “More hatred?​ More resentment? ‍And more racism?“\n\nRanking chairwoman Suzanne Bonamici, a ‌Democrat from Oregon, countered⁤ Owens’ ‌comparison of DEI initiatives to cancer, which she found “perplexing and quite offensive to anyone who has battled cancer.” In response, Owens, ⁤a cancer survivor himself, stood by his initial statement.\n\nBonamici argued that DEI offices strive to provide support and identify obstacles in ‍the education system​ to cater ⁣to “the needs of increasingly diverse populations, many of whom are first-generation college students.”\n\n“Unfortunately, some Republican-led state ⁣legislatures have‌ deemed DEI offices as too expensive,” she noted.\n\nBonamici‌ suggested that universities where DEI initiatives are falling short should be encouraged to‍ improve, ⁤rather than ​being outrightly ​condemned.\n\nThe Influence of DEI⁣ Initiatives in Medical Schools\n\nPrior ⁢to questioning​ the witnesses, Owens‌ mentioned an article he read about ​Columbia University facing criticism for a ‌2021 viral video in which students recited ‌a modified version of the ​Hippocratic oath during a white coat ceremony.\n\nThe altered oath included ‍phrases such as​ “We also acknowledge the ​acts​ and systems​ of⁢ oppression perpetrated in the ​name of⁢ medicine,” and‍ “We take this oath of service to commence ⁢building a⁢ future rooted in truth, restoration, and equity to realize​ medicine’s potential to liberate.”\n\nOwens asked ⁣witness Dr. Stanley Goldfarb, the chairman of Do No Harm, a ‍medical association opposing liberal ideology, whether the original oath mentions “systems⁤ of oppression in medicine.” Goldfard confirmed that ⁣the​ original ​oath did⁣ not ‍contain​ any such statements. When Owens inquired whether the purpose of medicine is to liberate, Goldfard, once again, responded with a “no.”\n\n“Doctors must retain a wealth ⁤of information, sift through it, comprehend human variability, and apply it to individual patients,” Goldfard‌ explained. “That’s why I firmly‍ believe that academic‌ achievement should be⁢ the primary criterion ‌for admission into⁢ medical school.”\n\n“I ‌think⁣ we can all agree ⁤that ​this‍ is one profession where meritocracy should be the primary focus,” Owens concurred.\n\nDEI Initiatives and Antisemitism in Universities\n\nOwens then directed his next​ question to Jay Greene, a⁢ senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation’s⁢ Center ⁣for⁢ Education Policy, about the impact of⁢ DEI initiatives ​on the Jewish community.\n\nIn his ​opening statement, ⁣Greene stated that instances of antisemitism⁣ in universities are not ‌isolated incidents. In his analysis of X accounts of university DEI staff, ⁣Greene‌ found evidence of “vehement hostility toward” ⁢Israel. He noted that these staff members posted “three⁤ times as often about ‌Israel as they⁢ do about China.” The language used to express this animosity includes terms like “apartheid, colonialism, genocide, and ethnic ‌cleansing.”\n\nOwens then turned to witness Erec Smith, an associate professor of rhetoric​ at York College of Pennsylvania ​and a CATO research fellow, asking him to elaborate on his statements about DEI initiatives being “subtly anti-Black,” ⁢and how he was labeled a “white supremacist” for opposing these initiatives as a Black ‌academic.\n\nIn his opening statement, Smith⁢ mentioned prescriptive ⁢racism, which assigns “certain values, attitudes, and behaviors to someone based on ⁢their race,” as a component of‌ social justice reform.\n\nHe cited instances of professors allowing and encouraging Black students to write in African American vernacular, also known as ‌Ebonics. When students refused to abandon standardized English, these professors perceived⁤ it “as a ⁣form of self-hatred ​and internalized racism,” Smith explained.\n\n“Teaching standardized English is not⁢ inherently racist,” he assured Owens.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/03/08/owens-labels-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-initiatives-as-cancer-within-educational-institutions/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Biden leverages spirited State of the Union to differentiate from Trump and persuade voters for a second term","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4351-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"WASHINGTON — In his ‍State of​ the Union⁤ address on Thursday night, President Joe ​Biden passionately made ‍his case for ⁣a second term.

Several House Republicans began ⁢to stand up and leave the chamber as Biden discussed raising taxes ⁤on billionaires and corporations.​ Others,⁢ like Johnson, remained seated and shook their‍ heads.\n\n‘I know you know how to read’\n\nBiden‍ engaged in a spirited exchange ⁤with lawmakers as he rhetorically ⁢questioned⁣ the fairness‌ of the tax code and whether billionaires and corporations need “another $2 trillion in tax ⁢breaks,” as he ​claimed ⁢Republicans ⁢want.\n\nOne of the most heated⁢ moments of⁣ his speech occurred ‍during his comments on immigration, when Biden​ was ⁢listing ‍the ⁤endorsements by conservative⁢ groups of the bipartisan border legislation that Republicans killed last month.\n\nSome in the audience​ seemed to‌ shout and interrupt, and⁣ Biden retorted,‍ “I know you ⁤know how to read.”\n\nAs Rep.⁣ Marjorie Taylor Greene, adorned in pro-Trump gear, continued to yell​ at Biden, the president held up a white button that the‍ Georgia Republican‌ had given him earlier bearing the name ‍of Laken Riley, who⁢ authorities say⁢ was ‌killed by a Venezuelan national who illegally crossed into the⁣ U.S. in September 2022.\n\n“Laken Riley,” Biden said, referring⁣ to‌ her as an “innocent young woman who ​was killed ‍by an illegal.” He expressed his condolences to her⁢ family, saying his heart goes out to them.\n\nMeanwhile, congressional Republican leaders were highlighting one of their​ newest lawmakers ‍through the State‍ of the Union rebuttal in an attempt to draw a generational contrast with Biden. Alabama‍ Sen. Katie Britt, the youngest Republican woman elected to the Senate,⁤ planned to depict a nation that “seems to‍ be ⁤slipping away” and one where “our families are hurting.”\n\n“Right now, our commander-in-chief is not in ​command.‍ The free⁢ world deserves better than a⁣ dithering⁣ and diminished leader,”⁤ Britt was ⁤expected to say, ⁣according to excerpts released Thursday⁣ evening. ​”America ‌deserves leaders who recognize that secure borders, ⁢stable prices, safe streets, and a ⁢strong defense are ‌the cornerstones of⁢ a great nation.”\n\nBiden ​painted a hopeful picture of the country’s future as the major pieces ‍of legislation he‍ signed into law during​ his first two years in office are implemented. ‍But he also warned that the progress ⁤he sees at home and⁢ abroad is fragile — and particularly vulnerable if Trump ‍returns to ​the White House.\n\nTrump, for his ⁣part, ⁣said he planned ​to respond in real-time ⁤to Biden’s remarks on his Truth Social platform.\n\nUkraine and Gaza\n\nThis year, Biden faced heightened ⁢emotions — particularly among his ⁣base supporters — over his staunch backing​ for Israel’s war against Hamas ⁣in Gaza. The White House ⁢had initially hoped a short-term cease-fire‌ would be in place by the speech. It blames Hamas for not yet accepting a deal brokered by the⁢ U.S.‌ and its allies.\n\nA number of Democrats and Republicans⁢ wore pins ​and stickers in ⁣honor of ⁤the Israeli ⁣hostages​ still being ​held captive in Gaza. Meanwhile,​ several House progressives wore Palestinian⁣ keffiyehs, the black and white checkered ⁣scarfs that have come to symbolize Palestinian solidarity. Biden’s‌ motorcade took a circuitous route to the Capitol, as ​hundreds of pro-cease-fire demonstrators tried⁢ to disrupt its‌ path from the White House.\n\nAmid growing concerns about the⁣ dire⁢ humanitarian situation in Gaza, Biden announced in his address that‌ he has ​directed the U.S. military to‌ establish a temporary port ‍on the Gaza coast aimed at increasing the flow of aid into the beleaguered territory.\n\nThe president also⁣ issued a strong call for lawmakers to ​pass urgently needed defense assistance for ‌Ukraine. Acute ammunition shortages have allowed Russia to retake the offensive⁤ in⁢ the 2-year-old war.\n\nThe GOP-controlled House has refused to act⁣ on a Senate-passed ‍version ‍of the aid legislation, insisting on new stricter measures to limit migration at the U.S.-Mexico border, after ⁤Trump⁤ used his influence to help sink a bipartisan compromise that supporters ‍say would have done just that.\n\n‘The law of the​ land’\n\nAccess to abortion and fertility‍ treatments was ‌also a key component of Biden’s speech, especially in‌ light‌ of a controversial ruling⁣ from⁣ Alabama’s⁤ Supreme Court that⁣ has disrupted access‌ to in vitro ​fertilization treatment in the state.\n\nOne of first lady Jill Biden’s guests⁢ for the speech was Kate Cox, who sued Texas, and ultimately left her home state, to obtain an emergency abortion after⁢ a severe fetal anomaly was detected.\n\n“If Americans send me ⁣a Congress that supports ⁤the right to choose I promise you: I will restore Roe⁤ v. Wade as the law of the land again,” Biden said. Several House Democratic women were‍ wearing white — a symbol of⁣ women’s​ suffrage — to promote reproductive ‍rights.\n\nThe⁢ White House also invited⁣ union leaders, a gun control advocate and others ​that Jill Biden and her husband have met as⁤ they traveled the country promoting‍ his​ agenda.‌ The‌ prime minister of Sweden, Ulf Kristersson, ​will attend to mark his‍ country’s accession to NATO in the wake of Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nExpelled and ⁢disgraced, former⁢ Rep. George Santos, who still retains floor privileges as an ex-member of Congress,​ also showed up ‌for the speech.\n\n‘Shrinkflation’\n\nHeading into⁢ the State of⁤ the Union, Biden also addressed the issues ‍of “shrinkflation”‌ — companies putting fewer pretzels in the jar and less yogurt in sealed cups — and so-called “junk fees” on services. While⁤ neither ​is a main⁤ driver of inflation,‌ the White House hopes to​ show consumers ⁢that Biden​ is fighting for them.\n\nBiden also⁣ unveiled an ⁣expanded plan to⁢ raise​ corporate taxes⁤ and use the proceeds to reduce budget deficits and cut taxes for the middle class.\n\nBiden entered the speech with work to do to improve ‌his standing.⁤ Just 38% ⁣of U.S. ‌adults approve of how he is handling his job as president, while 61% disapprove, ‌according ⁢to a recent ‌survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nThe ⁢same survey​ found that more than 6 in 10 (63%) say they’re not very or not at all confident in Biden’s mental‍ capability to serve effectively as‍ president. A similar but slightly smaller share (57%) say that Trump ‌lacks‌ the memory ⁢and acuity⁤ for the job.\n\nThe already intense scrutiny ⁤of⁢ Biden’s age was magnified when special counsel Robert Hur raised questions about the ⁤president’s mental acuity in his⁤ report last month on Biden’s handling of classified information. Hur is set to testify⁤ Tuesday before lawmakers about his investigation.\n\nAfter the speech, Biden ‍was scheduled for⁣ a weekend of campaign travel, holding events in Pennsylvania ‌on⁣ Friday and Georgia on ⁤Saturday.‍ Trump, ⁣too, will be ⁤campaigning in Georgia that day. The ⁤president’s Cabinet also ⁢will fan out across the country to ​amplify his message.\n\nThe Biden campaign said it would host more ‍than 200 watch parties around the country Thursday night, including in cities, suburbs‍ and rural towns in battleground states. Campaign officials will use the events to recruit ⁣volunteers ‍and⁣ encourage others to ⁣get involved in Biden’s reelection effort.\n\nrnrn","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/03/08/biden-leverages-spirited-state-of-the-union-to-differentiate-from-trump-and-persuade-voters-for-a-second-term/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Jason Palmer triumphs over Joe Biden in Democratic caucus of American Samoa","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4339-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"WASHINGTON — In a surprising turn of events, President Joe Biden, who was‌ dominating every​ Democratic contest on Super Tuesday, stumbled in American Samoa.\n\nUnexpectedly, a relatively‍ unknown candidate named Jason⁢ Palmer⁣ outperformed Biden⁣ in the territory’s caucus. ⁤With a total of 91 votes‍ cast, Palmer secured ⁣51, ‍leaving Biden trailing with 40, as reported by the local party.\n\n“The news of my ⁢victory reached me through a flurry⁢ of ​texts from friends and campaign staff,” ‌Palmer shared in​ a late-night interview on Tuesday.\n\nAt 52, ⁢Palmer confessed that he had never set foot in the territory‍ before the caucus. “My campaign ⁢was conducted remotely.

However, their teams⁤ have recently resumed discussions regarding an ⁢endorsement.\n\n“The support‍ that former President ⁤Trump has‌ garnered from Republican ⁢voters clearly ‌indicates that he is our party’s preferred nominee for President of the United States,”⁤ McConnell stated.\n\nMcConnell added, “As the‍ nominee, he will naturally have my support.”\n\nMcConnell’s endorsement, ⁢despite‍ his previous criticism of Trump as “morally ‌responsible” for the 2021​ Capitol‌ attack, ⁣lends a sense​ of institutional legitimacy to the former president’s campaign to reclaim the White House.\n\nThis endorsement ⁣comes on the ‍heels of McConnell’s recent⁤ announcement that​ he will not‍ seek re-election as leader after this term, a position he ⁢has held longer ‌than any other senator.

This is because it is the first temple to be completed after the Church of Jesus Christ was founded in 1830. Moreover, it‍ is believed that Jesus Christ appeared​ there a few days⁣ after Joseph Smith dedicated it in 1836.\n\nPresident Russell M. Nelson of The Church of Jesus Christ of⁢ Latter-day Saints expressed his ‍gratitude​ to the​ Community⁢ of Christ for‌ their stewardship of these sacred places, documents, and artifacts. He ‌said in ⁤the joint statement, “We are deeply honored to assume the stewardship of these sacred places, documents and artifacts. We thank our friends at Community of Christ for their great care and cooperation in preserving these historical treasures thus far. We are committed to doing the same.”\n\nDue to persecution, the Latter-day‍ Saints had to leave Kirtland,​ Ohio, in 1838. The ownership​ of the temple, which was initially with Joseph ⁣Smith, became unclear after his⁢ murder in 1844. The Community of ‌Christ, formerly known as the⁢ Reorganized Church of⁢ Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, had been ​the primary caretaker of‍ the temple for over 140​ years.\n\nThe two churches have ⁤been ‌working⁣ on the transfer of ownership since 2021, according to the joint statement. They have​ a respectful relationship, and the Community ⁣of Christ had previously sold historic sites‍ in Missouri‍ and Ohio to the⁤ Church of Jesus Christ ⁤in 2012 and the ​printer’s manuscript‍ of the Book of Mormon in 2017.\n\nThe recent transfer of⁣ historic ‍sites and ‌documents includes numerous items and buildings, such as church history sites in ‌Nauvoo, Illinois. These include significant buildings within ⁢church ‍history,​ like ​the Red Brick Store, where the⁢ Relief ⁣Society, ​the church’s global women’s organization, was ‍first⁢ organized. Other​ sites include⁣ the‍ Joseph and Emma ⁤Smith Mansion ‍House, the Nauvoo⁤ House,‌ and the Smith Family Homestead.\n\nAlso included in the⁢ sale was the Bible used in the Joseph Smith translation of the Bible, the original door of⁢ Liberty Jail, and many other items and manuscripts. The purchase ‌price of the historic sites and⁣ documents was $192.5 million, as per a ⁤Q&A released on the church’s ‍Newsroom‍ website.\n\nThe ​Kirtland Temple is ⁤the centerpiece of this ⁣transaction. It⁤ was nominated as a National⁢ Historic Landmark in 1969 and officially designated⁢ as one in 1976. But its significance‍ extends beyond its historical importance to both churches.⁢ The temple is considered sacred due to what ‌one Latter-day Saint leader referred to as “the great​ pentecostal outpouring that Joseph ⁢and the Saints received ​in Kirtland.”\n\nAs the late church President Gordon ​B. Hinckley said in 2003, “There is something unique and​ wonderful about what happened here. Nothing like it has occurred anywhere else‍ in the history of the church, either before or since.”\n\nJoseph Smith reported that the spiritual priesthood keys‍ to operating Christ’s ancient ⁤church were ⁣restored by three angelic visitors at the Kirtland ‍Temple — Moses, Elias, and Elijah. They restored the power to seal families together forever, a cornerstone of the Latter-day Saint faith. Today, the church operates⁢ 188 temples worldwide and has plans to build 147 more.\n\nThe Reorganized Church, which became ⁣the Community of Christ in 2001, obtained the ‌Kirtland ⁢Temple through Joseph Smith’s son. Joseph Smith III bought the temple through a ⁢quit-claim deed in 1874. He⁢ gave the‍ property to the Reorganized Church⁣ in 1880, and the title was finalized in 1901.\n\nBefore Joseph Smith and the Latter-day Saints⁢ left Kirtland, the ⁤Kirtland Temple served as much as a meetinghouse as a⁢ temple. Church members used it for Sunday worship services, Thursday⁢ prayer‍ and fasting meetings, regular school, and a church choir.\n\nToday, Latter-day Saint⁤ temples open‍ to the public briefly after new construction or renovations, then are dedicated for the purpose of performing ⁣temple ordinances carried out by Latter-day Saints with active temple recommends. The Community of​ Christ has used the Kirtland Temple for various meetings and⁤ has opened it to ​the public for tours. The⁢ Church of Jesus Christ announced​ that the Kirtland Temple will remain a historic building ‍open to the public.\n\nThe church ​plans to reopen the temple for free⁣ public tours on⁣ March 25. The Community ‍of⁢ Christ will be given⁢ special access to use the Kirtland Temple for ‌some meetings.\n\nThe Church of ‍Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a fully functioning temple in Columbus, Ohio, and a second temple in​ the state, in Cleveland, is under⁣ construction.\n\nCommunity of Christ President ‍Stephen M.

Community of Christ affirms the intrinsic worth of‌ every‍ person​ and provides⁢ a place to belong, be loved and valued, grow spiritually, and discover⁢ a purpose that can change lives⁤ and communities.\n\nThe Church ‍of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a worldwide faith, teaches​ that ‌our Father in Heaven and his ⁣Son Jesus Christ have ⁤in our​ day ​again called a ​living prophet and ⁢restored priesthood authority and covenants to bless families and individuals with joy. Members seek to live ⁣and share the gospel of Jesus Christ, care for those​ in need and unite families for eternity.

What was ​included​ in the transaction?\n\nThe⁣ transaction involves land, buildings, artifacts, and documents. ‌The real estate, along with some artifacts, are in Kirtland, Ohio, ⁣and Nauvoo, Illinois, while artifacts and documents ‍also come from Community of Christ Library and Archives in Independence,‌ Missouri.\n\n2. What are the most ​significant items?\n\nThe most significant properties are the Kirtland Temple, ⁤the ⁢Smith Family Homestead, the Mansion ​House, ⁢the Nauvoo House, and the Red Brick Store. ‌Significant documents and artifacts include manuscripts and the Bible used⁢ in the‍ Joseph Smith⁢ Translation of the Bible, ⁢seven‍ letters ​from Joseph Smith to his ⁣wife Emma, ​John Whitmer’s⁣ history of the church, original portraits of Joseph and Emma Smith, ‌the⁢ cornerstone‍ of the Nauvoo House, the original door of‌ Liberty Jail, and a document with ‍the title of “Caractors,” which may contain a ‌sample of inscriptions ​from the gold plates. (See the appendix ⁢for a more detailed list of ‍items transferred.)\n\n3. How did ​Community of​ Christ acquire these materials?\n\nAfter the Saints left Kirtland in the ⁣1830s, different parties ⁣controlled access to ‌the temple over⁤ the‌ years. In 1901, Community of Christ, then known as the Reorganized Church of​ Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (“RLDS Church”) secured title to the‌ Kirtland⁢ Temple through legal proceedings.⁣ The⁣ Smith family properties in Nauvoo remained in possession of Emma Smith after Joseph Smith’s death and she and her children eventually joined the RLDS Church. Thereafter,⁣ the properties passed through family connections to⁣ the RLDS ⁤Church. ​Other documents and artifacts were donated⁢ to ⁣the RLDS Church archives by their individual ⁣owners.\n\n4. Why did Community of Christ sell these materials‌ now?\n\nAs Community of Christ President Stephen M. Veazey‍ noted in the joint statement, ⁢the transfer ‌of materials at this time enables ​their mission and ‌priorities around the world.\n\n5.⁢ Why did The Church of Jesus⁣ Christ of Latter-day⁢ Saints purchase these ​materials?\n\nThe sites‌ and ⁢artifacts in this‍ transaction relate to significant events and people in⁤ the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\n6. What is the relationship between the two churches?\n\nThe two churches enjoy a strong, respectful, and friendly relationship. For many decades, we have collaborated on numerous historical⁣ and humanitarian projects.\n\n7. Have there been previous transactions of ‍historic materials between the two churches?\n\nYes. In 2012,‌ Community of Christ sold to the Church of Jesus Christ ⁤several properties, including the Hawn’s Mill Massacre site and the Joseph‍ and‍ Emma Smith⁣ home in Kirtland. Five years later, Community of Christ sold the Printer’s Manuscript ⁤of the Book of Mormon to the ⁣Church of Jesus Christ.\n\n8. What was paid for the properties,‌ artifacts,‌ and documents?\n\nThe church‌ paid $192.5 million without ⁢assigning specific values to the⁤ properties and items.\n\n9. Will the historic sites be open to the public?\n\nYes. The historic buildings in Kirtland and Nauvoo closed​ on March 5, 2024, to facilitate the​ transfer of ownership and will ⁤reopen to the public ‌on March 25, 2024. Tours will be provided of the Kirtland⁣ Temple, the ​Smith Family Homestead, the Mansion House, and the‍ Red Brick Store. Updated visitor information will be published on the historic site webpages for Historic Kirtland and Historic Nauvoo.\n\n10.

The search was conducted under the mistaken belief that her home harbored a stolen truck. The jury awarded Johnson a staggering $3.76 million, a⁣ verdict made possible by a recent Colorado law that permits citizens to sue police for infringing on ‌their ‍state ⁢constitutional rights.\n\nThe jury’s decision was delivered late Friday in a state court in Denver, with the⁢ American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Colorado, who assisted Johnson‍ in her legal battle, announcing the verdict on Monday. The lawsuit claimed that the police had obtained ⁤a search warrant for Johnson’s home based⁣ on information from the owner of⁢ the stolen‌ truck. The truck contained four semi-automatic handguns,⁢ a rifle, ‌a revolver, two drones, $4,000 in cash, and an iPhone. The owner had tracked the iPhone to Johnson’s ​residence using the Find My app ⁣and relayed this information⁢ to⁢ the police.\n\nAs per the lawsuit, Johnson, a retired U.S. Postal Service worker and grandmother, had just stepped out⁣ of the shower ⁤on ⁤the morning of Jan. 4, 2022, when she heard a loud command⁤ over a bullhorn instructing anyone inside the‍ house ⁤to exit with their hands up. Clad only in her bathrobe, ⁤she opened her front door to find an armored personnel‌ carrier parked on her ⁢front lawn, police vehicles lining her street, and men in full military-style gear, armed ‍with rifles and accompanied by a police dog.\n\nThe lawsuit further stated that ​Detective Gary Staab had erroneously‌ obtained the warrant to⁤ search Johnson’s home, failing to clarify that the⁣ app’s information is‍ not exact and only provides a general location of where a⁤ phone might be.\n\nNeither Staab nor the supervisor who approved the search warrant, Sgt. Gregory Buschy, who was also sued, responded to requests for comment. The ​Denver Police Department, which was not a defendant in the lawsuit, refrained from commenting on the verdict.\n\nThe lawsuit ⁢was ​filed‍ under a clause of a comprehensive police reform bill passed in 2020, ​following the murder of‍ George Floyd. This is‌ the first significant case to go to trial under⁤ this provision, according to the‍ ACLU of Colorado.​ The bill allows individuals to sue police‍ officers ⁣for ⁣state constitutional violations in state court. Prior to this, allegations of police misconduct could only be pursued in federal court, where it has become increasingly challenging ‍to⁢ litigate such cases,‌ largely due ‍to the legal doctrine known as qualified immunity. This doctrine protects officials, ​including police officers, from lawsuits seeking monetary damages for actions taken in the‍ course of their duties.\n\nThe lawsuit also detailed how the police⁤ used a battering ⁣ram to force entry into Johnson’s garage, despite her explaining how ​to⁤ open⁢ the door. They also damaged ‍the ceiling tiles to‍ access her attic, standing on one of her ⁤brand⁣ new‌ dining room chairs in the process. They even broke the head off a ‌doll made to ⁤resemble Johnson, complete ⁣with glasses, according to Tim Macdonald, ⁣ACLU of⁢ Colorado’s legal director.\n\nWhile Johnson is Black, the lawsuit did not claim that race was a factor in the incident,​ Macdonald clarified.\n\nMacdonald emphasized that the most ‌significant ​damage was inflicted ⁣on Johnson’s sense of security in her own home, where ⁤she had raised three children as a single⁤ mother. ‌She had even sacrificed Christmas​ and birthday⁤ gifts to afford the house. The⁣ incident led to her developing ulcers and sleep problems, eventually prompting ⁤her to relocate to a different neighborhood.\n\n“For us, the ‌damage was always about the psychological and⁢ the emotional ⁤harm⁢ to Ms. Johnson,” Macdonald stated.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/03/05/3-8m-awarded-to-woman-after-swat-team-mistakenly-searches-her-home-due-to-app-error/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"White House ends COVID-19 testing requirement for individuals near Biden, marking the conclusion of a pandemic-era measure","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4279-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"WASHINGTON —⁣ In a significant‍ move on​ Monday, the ‍White House⁤ announced the ‍removal of its COVID-19 testing mandate ‌for individuals‍ who are expected to be in close proximity with President Joe ⁢Biden, ‍Vice President Kamala Harris, and their respective spouses. This decision marks the ⁤termination‍ of the final ‍COVID-19 prevention measure in place​ at the White⁤ House.\n\nThe White House clarified that this modification in policy is in line with ⁣the⁣ latest guidelines from the Centers for ⁤Disease Control‍ and Prevention (CDC). The CDC, last week, eased its previous advice that required individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 to isolate for⁢ five days. The updated guidance now states that individuals can resume work or their usual activities if their ​symptoms are mild, improving, and they have been fever-free for at ⁣least a day.\n\nThe testing protocol at the White ⁣House was first implemented in ‍the‌ early stages of the pandemic in 2020, during the⁤ tenure ‌of former President Donald Trump. The ‌protocol was further fortified when​ President Biden assumed office in January 2021, amidst ‍the ongoing pandemic.\n\nBoth former President Trump and President Biden tested positive‌ for ⁤the virus while serving​ in‌ office.

No previous court had applied‍ Section 3 to a presidential candidate.\n\nSome election analysts have cautioned that a ruling necessitating congressional action to implement Section 3⁤ could potentially ⁢reignite ‍a battle ⁢over using the provision to disqualify Trump should he win the election. In one hypothetical scenario, a Democrat-controlled Congress could attempt ​to reject the certification​ of Trump’s election on Jan. 6, 2025, under this clause.\n\nThe issue could then potentially return to the court.\n\nBoth ⁤parties had urged the court to expedite its decision, which was heard less than a month ago, on Feb. ⁤8. At⁣ that time,⁣ the ⁤justices appeared inclined to rule in favor of Trump.\n\nTrump had been removed from the ballots in⁤ Colorado, Maine, and Illinois, but all three rulings were temporarily suspended pending the Supreme Court’s decision.\n\nThis case represents the court’s most direct involvement in a presidential election since Bush v. Gore, a ‌decision made 25 years ago that effectively awarded the 2000‌ election to Republican George W. Bush. It’s​ just one of ⁤several ‍cases involving Trump directly or that could impact his ‍chances of becoming president again, including‍ a⁤ case set for arguments ‍in late April about whether he can be criminally ‌prosecuted on election interference charges, including his⁢ role in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. The timing of the high court’s intervention has sparked questions about whether Trump will ‌be tried before the November election.\n\nThe February arguments ⁢marked the first time the high ‍court had heard a case involving Section 3. This⁢ two-sentence provision, intended ‌to prevent some Confederates from holding office again, states that those who violate oaths to support the ⁢Constitution are ​barred from ​various positions including congressional offices or serving as presidential‌ electors. However, it does not specifically mention ⁢the presidency.\n\nJustices from both conservative and liberal sides questioned the case against Trump. Their primary concern was whether Congress must act before states⁣ can invoke the 14th Amendment. There were also questions about whether the ‍president is covered by the provision.\n\nThe attorneys representing Republican and independent voters ​who sued to ​remove Trump’s name ‍from the Colorado ballot argued that there is ample evidence that the events of Jan. ⁤6 constituted an insurrection and that it was incited⁢ by Trump, who had urged a crowd ⁢of his supporters at a rally outside the ⁤White House to “fight like hell.” They contended that it would be absurd to apply Section 3 to everything but‌ the presidency or that Trump is somehow exempt. They also argued​ that the provision does not require enabling ​legislation.\n\nTrump’s attorneys presented several arguments for why the⁤ amendment cannot be used to⁤ keep him off ⁢the ballot. They argued that the Jan. 6 riot wasn’t an insurrection and, even if it was,⁢ Trump did not go to the Capitol or join the rioters. They also stated that the wording of the amendment excludes the presidency and candidates running for president. Even if all these arguments were rejected, they said, Congress would need to pass legislation to revive Section 3.\n\nThe case was decided by a court that includes three justices appointed by Trump during his presidency. They have considered many Trump-related cases in recent ‍years, rejecting his claims of fraud in the 2020 election and refusing‍ to protect his ⁤tax records​ from Congress​ and prosecutors in New York.\n\nThe 5-4 decision in‍ the Bush⁢ v. Gore ‌case over 23 years ago was the last time the court was so deeply involved in presidential politics. Justice Clarence ​Thomas ⁤is the only member of the court ‌who was on the bench then. Thomas has disregarded calls by⁣ some ⁢Democratic⁣ lawmakers to recuse himself from the Trump⁤ case because his wife, Ginni,‌ supported Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election results and attended the rally⁤ that preceded the storming of the Capitol by Trump supporters.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/03/04/supreme-court-reinstates-trump-on-ballot-dismisses-state-efforts-to-disqualify-him-due-to-capitol-assault/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Curtis Asserts Need for Reforms as Congress Approves Bill to Hasten Advanced Nuclear Initiatives","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4256-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"From ​the heart of SALT LAKE‍ CITY, a significant development in the U.S. ⁣nuclear industry was announced.⁤ On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bipartisan bill aimed at bolstering nuclear projects. The bill aims to simplify the approval process and offers‍ financial incentives to development⁣ companies, helping them navigate through‌ regulatory ⁣challenges.\n\nThe bill, known ⁣as the ‌Atomic Energy Advancement Act, received⁢ an impressive 356-35 vote. This act is set to⁤ accelerate the development and construction of new nuclear reactors across the country.\n\nThe ‌bill’s overwhelming approval, backed by 166 Democrats, ‌signifies a significant shift in attitudes towards nuclear power as a viable source of carbon-free power generation. The‍ bill mirrors Senate ‍legislation approved earlier this year, as reported by the Washington Examiner.\n\nRep. John Curtis, R-Utah,​ a strong advocate for the bill, stated that these‌ reforms are crucial. He testified in favor of ‌the bill, which includes some financial provisions‌ he authored.\n\n“The Advanced Nuclear Reactor Prize Act would empower the secretary of energy to grant targeted ⁤awards to cover fees assessed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for⁤ first ‍technologies that are licensed and made operational in five unique⁢ categories. The bill stipulates that ‍awards cannot exceed total amounts expended by the eligible entity, excluding other federal support,” he explained.\n\nIn a press release, Curtis further emphasized the need ⁤for innovation in the ⁤nuclear sector. He stated, “The costs and red tape ⁤associated with our permitting process are proving to be⁢ duplicative and ineffective. We need⁣ innovation ​in the nuclear space to ensure affordable, reliable and clean energy in our future. Congress must do more to ensure that this can happen.”\n\nThe bill was passed ‌under suspension ‌of the body’s ‍rules.\n\nCurtis has first-hand experience with ​the lengthy process of bringing an advanced nuclear project to​ life. His district includes municipal power producers that were part of the Carbon Free Power Project by NuScale and the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems.\n\nUnfortunately,⁣ this project, which was the only advanced Small Modular Reactor technology to receive a design ‍approval from ‌the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, was canceled last year due to prolonged regulatory delays that increased ⁤costs for potential customers.\n\n“The costs and red tape associated with⁤ our permitting process are proving to be duplicative and ineffective. We need innovation ‌in the nuclear space to ensure affordable, ⁤reliable and clean energy in our future.”\n\n–Rep. John Curtis, R-Utah\n\nThe municipal power association had collaborated with NuScale Power for over a decade to establish a small nuclear power​ plant ⁤at the Idaho National Laboratory east of Idaho Falls.\n\nThe INL‍ is⁣ the U.S. Department ⁤of Energy’s leading laboratory for nuclear research. Despite ⁣significant investment from three presidential administrations, the project encountered prohibitive ‍costs and was ultimately abandoned.\n\nExpressing his ​disappointment, Curtis said, “I’m saddened to learn of this project’s cancellation. Current and future nuclear will play a vital role in America’s energy mix. This can be a learning experience for other SMR projects, ⁢and Congress should take this opportunity to ensure the permitting process for⁢ energy projects is designed to encourage innovation.”\n\nExpanding nuclear energy in the United States would boost the nation’s uranium industry,‌ including in Utah, which is home‌ to mining operations and the only conventional uranium mill operation in the United States, the White Mesa Mill in San Juan County. Despite a⁤ nearly tenfold increase ⁤in uranium concentrate production in 2023 due to a⁣ spike in prices, ⁢the United States domestically produces ‌only about 5% of the uranium it uses, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nThe provision by Curtis ‍was part of a larger bill sponsored ​by Rep.

This‌ simple product has sparked a complex debate among politicians,⁤ parents, and commentators, reflecting the intricate ⁢landscape where Big Tobacco companies are pushing ‌alternative products, while experts grapple with their potential advantages and drawbacks.\n\nZyn,‍ marketed by Philip⁢ Morris International to adult tobacco users, comes in flavors like mint, coffee, and citrus.‍ However, videos of ‌young people using these pouches have garnered millions of views on TikTok and other social media platforms, raising concerns that Zyn ‌could be the ​next nicotine⁢ product to lure ​underage teens, much like Juul did, leading to a surge in vaping. Some experts ⁤argue‌ that the risk is offset by the⁤ potential to divert adults‌ from cigarettes and other traditional tobacco products, which are responsible for 480,000 U.S. deaths each year.\n\nDr. Jasjit Ahluwalia,‍ an addiction‌ specialist at Brown University, argues, “The definition of insanity is doing the⁣ same thing and expecting ⁤a different result. That’s what we’ve done with tobacco for decades. We’ve been all about ‍abstinence, instead of embracing products ​that can reduce harm.”\n\nAhluwalia views nicotine pouches‌ and e-cigarettes​ as tools to help smokers reduce or quit cigarettes.‍ This approach is common in the U.K., but​ it’s not mainstream ‍in the U.S., ‌where only pharmaceutical-grade medications⁤ like nicotine gum and lozenges are officially approved to aid ​smokers in quitting.\n\nAhluwalia points ⁢out that Zyn functions⁤ similarly to these products: it releases low levels of⁤ nicotine that are absorbed into the gums, reducing cravings. The main difference, he notes, is that Zyn is sold by Philip Morris, the global cigarette ‌giant and a longtime adversary of anti-smoking groups.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Zyn recently seeped into politics, causing a rift ⁢between Democrats and​ Republicans in Washington ​and‌ escalating into another ‌battle in the nation’s culture war.\n\nIn late⁤ January, ‍Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, of New York, ‌urged regulators to investigate Zyn,⁣ citing its‌ appeal to​ teens. Several House Republicans then ‌warned constituents that “Big Brother”⁣ planned to “ban nicotine.”\n\nConservative commentator Tucker Carlson, a Zyn user, joined the debate, ‍stating: “Zyn is​ not a sin,” and promoting ⁢its unproven benefits, like “enhancing male ‍vitality and mental acuity.”\n\nZyn users have ‍quickly developed ‌their own online jargon, including⁢ “zynnies,” “zynner” and “zynsky.”\n\n“There’s this online subculture around Zyn that’s been spearheaded by younger ⁤males, but a lot of that’s not coming ⁤from the⁤ brand itself,” said Ollie Ganz, a Rutgers University ⁢tobacco and nicotine researcher.\n\nOnline videos show young people documenting their first experiences trying⁣ Zyn, reviewing⁢ different ⁤flavor combinations and ​displaying piles of ⁤used canisters.\n\n“It’s concerning to see the countless​ Zyn-related memes and hashtags that ⁢are⁤ being amplified and normalized across social ⁢media,” said Kathy Crosby, CEO⁤ of ⁢the Truth ‍Initiative, an⁢ anti-tobacco advocacy group.\n\nTruth and other groups point to research⁣ suggesting nicotine can ​interfere with brain development in‍ adolescents.\n\nIt’s the Food and Drug Administration’s job to balance Zyn’s risks to youngsters against its potential to help adults.\n\nIn ⁣a statement, an FDA spokesman said the agency ⁣is monitoring ​underage use, noting that 1.5% of high school and middle schoolers reported using pouches last year. That’s well below ⁢the ⁤10% who‌ used e-cigarettes.\n\nFDA officials have allowed Zyn ​to stay on the⁤ market while they review Philip‌ Morris’ marketing application, which has been pending since 2020. If teen⁢ use remains‌ low, the company ‍could win FDA authorization for at least ⁢some of its offerings, which come in ‍multiple strengths and flavors.\n\nIn​ 2019, the FDA⁣ awarded its first-ever ⁤reduced risk designation to ‌a similar product: snus, a tobacco pouch popular in Sweden that contains lower levels of carcinogens than cigarettes. The FDA said smokers who switch to snus reduce their ⁤risk of lung cancer,⁢ bronchitis and other diseases.\n\nZyn excludes the tobacco leaves found in snus, leaving only nicotine, which Philip Morris says increases its appeal.\n\n“People can be reluctant to move into⁣ an oral tobacco product if they view it as ​similar to traditional chewing tobacco,” company⁤ spokesman Corey Henry said. “Consumer acceptability ⁤is a big part ​of ‍Zyn.”\n\nPhilip Morris doesn’t use online influencers or endorsements to promote Zyn, Henry said. Its website is restricted to ⁤adults​ 21 and older. ​And ⁣flavors like cinnamon and peppermint are “familiar to⁢ adults,” Henry said.\n\nZyn launched in the⁣ U.S.‌ in 2014, but sales have skyrocketed in the past year,⁣ generating $1.8 billion⁢ as shipments accelerated year-over-year ⁣by ‌over 60%.\n\nOn⁢ a November call ‌with retailers, one ⁤company executive called the growth “gonzo” and “lights out.”\n\n“I didn’t see this coming. I don’t know anyone who did,” said Joseph Teller, a director for oral tobacco ⁣products.\n\nZyn‌ promotions‌ emphasize the pouches’ discreet, convenient nature⁢ as a “smoke-free,” “spit-free” alternative for smokers⁣ “at⁤ work” or “on the move.”\n\nBut to fulfill the company’s stated goal of a “smoke-free future,” Zyn will need to help users fully switch from cigarettes, rather than alternating between ⁣the two.\n\nThere’s little data on⁢ switching, and preliminary​ research suggests pouches may not be a great substitute.\n\nOhio State University researchers recently found it‍ took smokers 30 ‍minutes to an⁢ hour to‌ get enough‍ nicotine from Zyn to ​relieve their cravings. With cigarettes, smokers achieved the same nicotine levels — and relief — in ⁣five ​minutes.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/03/03/debate-among-politicians-and-health-experts-ignited-by-widespread-presence-of-zyn-nicotine-pouches-on-tiktok/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Historians Rush to Preserve Woodstock’s Stories as Memories of Peace and Music from the 1960s Start to Fade","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4238-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"BETHEL, N.Y. — The iconic Woodstock festival, a cornerstone of 1960s counterculture, didn’t⁤ actually take place in Woodstock.

They were drawn by the promise of an “Aquarian Exposition” offering⁣ “three days of⁣ peace, love and music”. ⁢Today, as​ these attendees approach the twilight of their lives, only⁣ a small ‌fraction of the population retains living memories of the 1960s.\n\nRecognizing the urgency of ​preserving these fading‍ memories, the Museum at Bethel Woods, situated on the festival site, has embarked on a five-year project. The aim is to separate fact from folklore and gather firsthand accounts of⁢ Woodstock before they disappear. This mission‍ has led ‌museum curators on a nationwide journey⁣ to document‍ and safeguard the⁢ reminiscences of those who were there.\n\nMusic journalist Rona Elliot, 77, who has been serving as ⁢one of the ​museum’s “community connectors,” emphasizes the importance of capturing history from those who lived​ it. Elliot herself has unique insights about the⁢ festival, having worked closely with organizers like Michael Lang, who ‍entrusted her with his archives before his passing in 2022.\n\nElliot describes Woodstock as “a jigsaw puzzle — a kaleidoscope of ⁣everything that transpired in the ’60s.”\n\nWhile many Woodstock‍ attendees have shared their experiences‌ in interviews over the years, the Bethel Woods museum is delving deeper with a project initiated in 2020. The approach mirrors that of renowned ​historian Studs​ Terkel, who compiled extensive oral ⁢histories of life during the Great Depression and World War ⁢II.\n\nNeal​ Hitch, senior curator and director of the‌ Museum At Bethel Woods, explains the distinction between a casual interview and an oral history preserved in a ‌museum. The latter requires reaching out to people​ in their⁢ comfort zones, encouraging them to share intimate, personal memories from their⁤ youth.\n\nTo⁢ locate and‌ engage individuals willing⁣ to recount their Woodstock stories, the ⁢museum secured grants totaling ‌over $235,000 from the Institute of Museum and​ Library‍ Services. This funding enabled curators and community connectors ​like Elliot to traverse the ​country and record these narratives.\n\nThe journey commenced in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and has since⁣ taken⁢ the team to ⁣Florida, Ohio, and California, among other ⁤locations. They’ve‌ visited⁣ a “Flower ⁢Power” cruise ship and a community center ⁣near the former residences⁤ of ⁢festival performers Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead.\n\nRichard Schoellhorn,⁢ 77, traveled from his home in Sebastopol, California, to share‌ his Woodstock experience. Initially hired as a security guard, he ended up volunteering when the festival became so crowded ‌that ticket sales ‌were halted.\n\nAnother attendee, Akinyele Sadiq, also met with the ‍curators in San Francisco ⁣to share his memories of watching the festival from ​a prime spot ​near the stage. His journey to and⁢ from the festival, which included hitchhiking and a ride in a converted hearse, was transformative.\n\nSo far, the curators‌ have collected over 500⁤ oral histories, each revealing unique, life-altering experiences. The project continues, with ‍upcoming visits planned for Boston, New York City, New Mexico, and Southern California.\n\nThe museum plans to spend 2025 analyzing the oral histories and initiating‍ special projects, such as reuniting friends who attended the ​festival together but now live apart.

However, ‍this could cause significant delays,​ and a new prosecutor might narrow the charges or decide not to proceed with the case.\n\nThe final arguments before ⁣McAfee on Friday came after a series of evidentiary hearings where Willis admitted to having⁤ an affair with Wade​ but accused a defense lawyer of lying about ⁤the timing and nature ‍of their relationship.\n\nThe affair was initially disclosed⁤ in a January‍ filing by a lawyer for Michael Roman, who argued that it constituted a conflict of interest and unjustly benefited Wade. Willis and⁣ Wade testified that​ their relationship only started after Wade’s employment, and ⁢prosecutors have argued that the relationship is irrelevant to the case as it ​did ‌not harm the defendants.\n\nDefense ‍lawyers have accused the prosecutors of lying to the court, ​alleging that the relationship began before Wade’s employment.

This move was made to prevent a⁣ partial government shutdown, with the Republican-led House of Representatives also supporting ⁤the⁤ bill, just a little ​over a day before the funding was set to expire.\n\nThe bill, which received a bipartisan approval in the Senate with a 77-13 vote, is now headed to President Joe Biden’s⁣ office for his signature. The bill outlines deadlines ​for ​funding different sections of the government, with one part to be funded by March 8 and‌ the other by March 22.\n\nPresident Biden, in‍ a statement, expressed his relief at the bill’s passage, stating⁢ that it would prevent a harmful ⁢shutdown. However, he also noted that this is merely a temporary solution and not a⁤ long-term fix.\n\nEarlier⁢ in the day, ‌the House⁢ saw 207 Democrats and 113 Republicans come together​ in a 320-99 vote to pass the short-term stopgap measure. This move gives‌ Congress additional‌ time to⁤ agree on the funding for the full⁤ fiscal year, which started on‌ Oct.‍ 1.\n\nIt’s been about‍ two months since Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer agreed on a $1.59‌ trillion discretionary spending level for the fiscal year.\n\nJohnson, who has only been in⁣ the speaker’s position since late October,​ once again relied ⁤on a procedural move that required⁣ Democrats to provide most of the support to pass the ⁣stopgap spending bill. This strategy could potentially upset hard-line conservatives.\n\nWith 97 “no” votes from ⁢his 219-member Republican ‌conference, Johnson ‌could face challenges as he takes up six full-year appropriations bills next week and ⁤moves on to the complex issue of aid to Ukraine.\n\nThree House ‍Republicans, including House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, anticipate that Johnson will address​ aid to Ukraine, Israel, and U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific after completing another six spending bills by‍ March 22. Earlier this month, the Senate passed ⁤the‍ $95 billion ​national security bill in a bipartisan ​vote.\n\nMcCaul, an eternal optimist, believes that they will get it done.

The infamous 2002 shooting took place⁤ in the legendary rapper’s studio.\n\nThe Brooklyn federal⁣ jury, whose identities were kept anonymous, found Karl Jordan Jr. and Ronald Washington guilty of‍ the murder.⁤ Prosecutors argued that the motive behind the killing was retaliation for a botched drug deal.\n\nJam Master Jay, whose real name was Jason Mizell, was a pivotal figure in the ⁣hip-hop scene during⁢ the 1980s. As a member of Run-DMC, he played a significant role in bringing hip-hop into the​ mainstream ​pop music‍ scene.‍ The group was known ‌for hits like “It’s ⁤Tricky” and their unique rendition of Aerosmith’s “Walk This‌ Way.”\n\nThe murder of‌ Jam Master Jay, much like the⁣ killings of Tupac Shakur and​ the Notorious B.I.G.⁣ in ⁢the ‌late 1990s, remained a mystery for years. Despite numerous tips and rumors, authorities struggled to find witnesses​ willing to come forward.\n\nBreon Peace, the leading federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, explained the‍ difficulty in solving the case. “The witnesses in the recording studio ‍knew the killers, and they were terrified that they would be retaliated against if they cooperated with law enforcement and identified‍ the ruthless executioners of Mr. Mizell. But their strength and resolve​ in testifying at this trial were a triumph of ⁢right ‌over ‌wrong and courage over fear.”\n\nInterestingly, Jordan, 40, was the godson of the renowned DJ, while Washington, 59, was ​a long-time friend who was staying at the DJ’s sister’s house. Both men ⁤were arrested in 2020 ‌and pleaded not⁤ guilty.\n\nFollowing the guilty verdict, Washington expressed his outrage at the​ jury, shouting, “Y’all just ⁢killed two innocent people.” Jordan’s supporters also voiced ‍their ⁤anger at the⁣ verdict, with Jordan⁢ expressing his love⁢ for​ them before they ‍were escorted out of the courtroom by U.S. Marshals.\n\nThe defense attorneys for both men⁣ have formally‍ requested​ the judge to overturn‍ the jury’s⁣ guilty verdict and acquit them. ⁢”We’re optimistic,” said Susan Kellman, one of⁤ Washington’s lawyers. “My client‌ did not do this.‍ And the‍ jury heard testimony ​about the ⁤person who did.”\n\nBoth men’s⁢ names⁤ have⁤ been associated with the case⁢ for years. Washington was publicly named as​ a suspect in 2007. In a 2003 interview with Playboy magazine, he claimed ‍to have been outside ⁣the studio when the shooting ‍occurred and saw “Little D” — one of Jordan’s aliases — fleeing the scene.\n\nDespite Run-DMC’s anti-drug message, ‍Mizell was⁢ reportedly involved in the⁣ drug trade to cover his debts and maintain his generous lifestyle. “He was a man who got ⁢involved in the drug game​ to take care of the people who depended on him,” said Assistant U.S. ⁢Attorney Artie McConnell.\n\nAccording to the prosecution, Mizell had planned‌ to ‍acquire 10 kilograms of ‍cocaine ‍and distribute it ⁤through Jordan, ⁤Washington, and a dealer based in Baltimore. However, the Baltimore dealer refused to work ⁣with ​Washington, leading to the alleged retaliation.\n\nTwo​ eyewitnesses, Uriel Rincon, a former studio aide, and Lydia High,‍ Mizell’s former business manager, testified that Washington blocked the door‌ and ordered ⁣High to lie on the floor while brandishing ⁣a gun. Rincon identified Jordan as the man who greeted Mizell moments before the shooting.\n\nOther witnesses testified that both​ Washington and Jordan made ​incriminating statements about the murder after​ it occurred.‍ However, their lawyers questioned the credibility and memory ‌of these witnesses, noting that some initially denied ‌being able to identify the attackers.\n\nThe trial also shed light on a third‍ defendant, Jay Bryant, who was charged last year after his DNA‌ was found on a hat⁣ at the scene.

This decision‍ comes in the wake‍ of recruitment challenges that ‍have made ⁤it difficult to fill ​all necessary positions.\n\nMost of the reductions will ​be in currently⁤ vacant positions, not active-duty soldiers.‌ These include roles related to counter-insurgency, ⁢which expanded during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars⁢ but are less necessary today. Approximately 3,000 of these reductions will ⁣be from Army special operations forces.\n\nSimultaneously, ⁢the Army plans to‍ increase its strength in other crucial areas by adding about ‌7,500 troops. These include air-defense and ‍counter-drone ⁣units, as ⁢well as five ‍new global task forces with enhanced cyber, intelligence, and‍ long-range strike ⁤capabilities.\n\nAn ⁤internal Army document reveals that the service is “significantly overstructured” with not enough soldiers to fill existing units.⁢ The document clarifies that the reductions ⁢are in “spaces” not “faces”, meaning⁢ the​ Army will not be asking soldiers to leave the force.\n\nThe ⁣decision reflects the ​reality that the Army has ​struggled to fill thousands of empty posts for ‍years. The current⁣ structure allows for up to 494,000 soldiers, but the actual​ number of active-duty soldiers is about 445,000. The new plan aims to recruit enough ​troops over the next five years to reach a level of ⁢470,000.\n\nThis restructuring ‍follows two decades of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, which necessitated a rapid and significant expansion of the Army. The focus of the military⁢ has since shifted towards great power‌ competition from adversaries such as China and ‌Russia, and threats from Iran and North ⁢Korea. The conflict in Ukraine has highlighted the need for a‌ greater emphasis on air-defense systems‍ and high-tech abilities to​ use and counter airborne ⁢and sea-based drones.\n\nA Strategic​ Shift for More Advanced Adversaries\n\nArmy leaders have conducted a thorough review‍ of all the service’s job specialties to identify areas for reduction. They also examined ‌the ongoing⁢ effort ‌to modernize the Army with new‍ high-tech weapons to determine where additional forces should be concentrated.\n\nAccording​ to‍ the plan, the Army ‌will eliminate about ‌10,000 positions⁢ for engineers and similar roles that were tied to⁤ counter-insurgency missions. An additional 2,700 reductions will come from units that don’t​ deploy often and can be trimmed, and 6,500 will come ⁢from various​ training‍ and other posts.\n\nApproximately 10,000 positions will ‍be cut from cavalry squadrons,⁣ Stryker brigade combat teams, infantry brigade combat teams, ​and security force assistance brigades, which⁢ are used to train foreign‍ forces.\n\nThese ⁤changes signify a significant shift ⁣in the Army’s preparation for large-scale combat operations against more advanced enemies. However, they also highlight the significant recruitment challenges faced by all military services.\n\nChallenges in Recruitment\n\nIn the last fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, the Navy, Army, and Air⁤ Force all fell short of their recruitment goals, while the Marine Corps and the newly formed Space Force ⁢met‍ their ⁣targets. The Army recruited just over 50,000 ‌individuals, falling significantly short of ⁤the‌ ambitious goal of 65,000.\n\nThe previous fiscal year also‌ saw​ the Army‍ miss its ‌enlistment goal by 15,000, with a target of 60,000.\n\nIn response to these challenges, the Army launched‌ a comprehensive overhaul of ‌its⁤ recruiting last fall. The focus is now on young people who have spent ⁣time in college or are early in their careers. The Army is also forming a new professional force ⁢of recruiters, moving away from the previous practice of randomly assigning soldiers to the task.\n\nArmy Secretary⁢ Christine Wormuth acknowledged that the service has struggled with recruitment “for many​ more⁣ years ⁤than one would think from just looking at the headlines​ in the last ​18 months.” She revealed that the service​ hasn’t⁣ met its annual ‍goal ​for new enlistment contracts since⁣ 2014.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/02/28/us-army-to-cut-thousands-of-positions-in-significant-overhaul-for-future-warfare-readiness/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Expectations Rise for a ‘Significant Surge’ in Spring Break Travel","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4115-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"As we edge closer to spring break, it seems that the travel bug has‍ bitten Americans harder than‌ ever before.\n\nAccording to the ⁢AAA organization, there’s been a “substantial surge” in⁤ the demand​ for flights and cruises in anticipation⁢ of the​ spring ‍break season.

This follows the tragic incident that occurred in 2021, ⁣where cinematographer​ Halyna Hutchins was fatally shot‌ on the set of the Western film “Rust”. The ruling ⁢was ‌made by a New Mexico judge on ⁢Monday.\n\nIt’s worth noting that there’s a scarce record of actors in Hollywood being criminally liable for a shooting death during ‍a‍ film production.\n\nThe ‌unfortunate incident led to the death of Hutchins when a live round was discharged from the revolver Baldwin was holding, which also injured director Joel Souza.\n\nThe “Rust”⁤ armorer, Hannah Gutierrez, is also facing trial for allegedly⁣ introducing the live ⁣round​ on set and failing to identify it. She confessed to the police that she loaded the​ live round into Baldwin’s gun, mistaking it for ​a dummy round.\n\nHowever, Gutierrez’s lawyers argue that she is being unfairly blamed for Baldwin’s​ failure to adhere‌ to ‍basic firearm safety protocols. Gutierrez, like Baldwin, is facing an involuntary manslaughter charge.\n\nBaldwin maintains ‍his innocence,⁣ stating that he‌ is not responsible for Hutchins’ death. His legal team is planning to file a motion to⁤ dismiss‌ the ​charges, arguing that the grand‌ jury did not follow‍ the judge’s rules when ⁣they reinstated charges against him in January, after they were initially dropped in April 2023.\n\nDuring Gutierrez’s trial on Monday, an FBI firearms expert‌ testified that⁤ the Italian-made Pietta reproduction Colt .45 revolver⁤ Baldwin​ was holding would ⁤not discharge when fully cocked unless the trigger was pulled.\n\nThis testimony contradicts Baldwin’s initial statements​ after the shooting. He claimed that he cocked ⁢the gun but did not pull the trigger.\n\n“The ‌gun would ⁢not discharge without pulling the trigger in the full cock position,” testified FBI forensic ⁢examiner Bryce Ziegler. He ‌added that he⁢ had to strike the gun’s hammer⁣ with a rawhide mallet to make it discharge in the fully-cocked ⁤position.\n\nIn a December 2021 interview with ‌ABC television, Baldwin⁢ stated⁤ that it was the ⁢responsibility of Gutierrez and others to ensure firearm safety,‍ and live rounds should never have been brought on ⁢set.\n\nFor over a century, ‌live rounds have been prohibited on ‌movie sets due​ to fatalities caused by their use during Hollywood’s silent⁢ era.\n\nThe SAG-AFTRA union, representing ‌the movie industry, has backed Baldwin’s stance, asserting that ⁢actors are not hired to be ‍weapons experts.\n\nThe outcome of‌ Gutierrez’s trial is likely to influence Baldwin’s defense strategy. If she is found guilty, legal experts⁢ believe it would be challenging to‌ convict​ Baldwin ‍of criminal negligence, as ‍it would be difficult to hold both Gutierrez and Baldwin accountable for firearm safety.\n\nIn a December 2021 television interview, Baldwin⁣ stated ‍that he was instructed to‌ aim the⁣ gun at the camera when it discharged.\n\n“I didn’t pull the trigger,” Baldwin told ABC television journalist George Stephanopoulos.‌ “I ​cocked the gun and go, ‌’Can you see that? ⁢Can ‌you see that?‌ And ‌I let go of ⁢the hammer of the gun⁣ and ​the⁤ gun goes off.”\n\nLast ‌year,⁤ charges against Baldwin were dropped after ⁣new evidence suggested that the hammer of the “Peacemaker” Colt 45 ‍might have been modified, and the gun⁤ could have ‌discharged without the trigger being pulled.\n\nHowever,⁤ prosecutors convened a grand⁢ jury to recharge Baldwin after an independent test of the single-action revolver confirmed the FBI’s findings that it⁤ would not ‍discharge without a trigger pull.\n\nZiegler stated that he did not observe ‍any⁣ modifications to the firearm ⁣when⁤ it arrived at the FBI labs⁤ in Quantico, Virginia.\n\n“The ​firearm⁣ was functioning normally when I received it,” he ‍said.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/02/27/trial-for-alec-baldwins-rust-shooting-incident-scheduled-for-july/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Examining the States that Most Accurately Reflect America — and Those that Don’t","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4091-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"From the heart of SALT LAKE CITY —‍ As the ​presidential election year kicked off, the ⁣spotlight was firmly on Iowa and New Hampshire. The question‍ on everyone’s lips was which‌ Republican presidential candidate would secure the first⁤ electoral caucus ​victories of ‍2024 in these states.\n\nA recent study by WalletHub delved into ‌the composition‍ of electorates,​ examining how closely they mirror the⁣ demographics of ​the population they represent. The study also sought to⁢ identify which state is ⁣the most representative of ‌the United States as a ⁢whole.\n\nStates that closely mirror the‌ overall representation:\n\nIllinois\nFlorida\nOhio\nVirginia\nPennsylvania\n\nStates that deviate ​significantly from ‌the overall representation:\n\nUtah\nMississippi\nAlabama\nWyoming\nVermont\n\nAccording to WalletHub analyst Cassandra Happe, “Illinois, Florida, and Ohio are far more representative‍ of the electorate than Iowa and New Hampshire, which rank ‍19th and 36th respectively out of the 50 states in terms of how well their ⁤demographics align with the U.S. population⁤ overall.” She suggests that the ⁢order of states in ​the⁣ presidential primaries should be based on⁢ representation rather than​ tradition or political favoritism.\n\nWhat differentiates the ‌most​ and least representative states?\n\nGiven ​the immense diversity of the ⁢United States, no single state can perfectly mirror the nation in ⁢all⁢ aspects. ‍However, ⁤Illinois came closest with a “94% similarity‍ when all demographics are averaged.”\n\nThe survey found that Illinois closely mirrors the nation in ⁢terms of‍ gender, age, the proportion of residents born in the U.S., ⁢and the unemployment rate, with over ‌99% similarity in each​ of these metrics.\n\nOn ⁢the other hand,⁢ Utah was found to be the least representative state, ranking⁢ last in the following categories:\n\nReligious composition of adults;\nWealth gap;\nAge characteristics;\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that every state contributes uniquely to the nation’s tapestry. The⁣ concept of being‌ the “worst” ⁣or “best” ‌representative is largely ⁣subjective and depends on the metrics used for comparison.\n\nThe significance of⁣ Iowa and New Hampshire in the presidential ⁤primaries\n\nFor years,⁣ Iowa and New ⁤Hampshire have been the first‌ ports of call ‌for presidential candidates on their campaign trail.\n\n“Since 1976, both parties have held their‌ first presidential nominating contests in Iowa, and the Iowa state legislature passed a law stating that its ‍caucuses need to be held‍ at least eight days before any other nominating ‍contest,” according to​ the National Constitution Center. “While Iowa ​holds the nation’s first presidential​ nominating contest, New ⁤Hampshire holds⁢ the nation’s first‌ primary election.”\n\nDespite their pivotal role in ⁢the presidential ⁢nomination process, neither ⁣state accurately reflects⁣ the nation’s ethnic and racial diversity. Furthermore, New Hampshire has an older median age compared‌ to the national average, as per the U.S. ⁣Embassy Japan.\n\nIn the WalletHub survey, Iowa and⁤ New Hampshire ranked ‌19th and 36th respectively in the electorate representation index. These rankings have​ led critics to question the disproportionate ⁤influence these states have in every presidential election.\n\nWhen ⁤asked if states that more ⁣closely mirror the national electorate ⁤should have their primaries earlier in the process, Alison Dagnes, professor and chair ​of the ⁢political science department at Shippensburg University, told WalletHub, ⁢”The national electorate is diverse, but some states have electorates that are far more homogenous.\n\n“Also, the Democratic Party tends to be more‌ diverse than ⁤the GOP, which means⁢ that ⁣the two parties​ are speaking to different⁢ constituencies. This is why the Democrats changed their primary schedule to make South Carolina, which is a more ⁢diverse ⁣state, hold their first-in-the-nation‌ primary. The ⁣parties ⁢can ⁢change⁢ the ⁣election order to​ best suit their needs since the parties are the ​ones who hold the ‍primary ⁢elections in the first place,” Dagnes⁢ added.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/02/26/examining-the-states-that-most-accurately-reflect-america-and-those-that-dont/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"AT&T to provide billing adjustments for customers affected by service disruption","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4076-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"WASHINGTON — In response to a significant wireless outage that occurred earlier this week, AT&T has announced that it will be issuing ⁤billing⁢ credits to affected customers,‌ the company confirmed late Saturday.\n\nAT&T, a⁣ leading telecommunications company with​ a 5G network that spans across the United States and serves approximately 290 million​ people, experienced a service disruption that lasted for over 10 hours on Thursday.\n\nThe company ⁤managed ‍to restore wireless service late⁢ on ⁣Thursday and attributed the issue to‍ “the application⁢ and ‍execution of an incorrect process” that was used during network expansion.\n\nOn⁢ Saturday, AT&T announced that it ⁤would be‌ compensating​ affected‌ customers by crediting them for the average cost⁣ of a full day ‌of service.

Tolbert now faces nine felony charges, including first-degree child abuse and violation of Michigan’s gun storage law.\n\nThe ‍tragic incident occurred just a day after Michigan’s new law on ⁣gun storage around children came into effect.\n\nGenesee County prosecutors have confirmed that Tolbert has pleaded not guilty. According to online court records, he is represented by the county’s office of the public defender. A ⁤spokesperson for the office stated on ​Thursday that Tolbert would be‌ assigned an attorney but had not ⁤yet met with​ his ‌defense.\n\nIn response to a 15-year-old student opening​ fire at his high school in Oxford Township, killing four classmates, Michigan Democrats proposed a comprehensive package of legislative measures on guns in 2021.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t until Democrats took full control of the ⁤Legislature from Republicans ⁢in 2022 that these proposals could be passed. A second mass shooting on the Michigan State University campus in February further propelled these measures to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nThe new storage law mandates gun owners to store unloaded firearms in a ⁣locked box or container when it is “reasonably known that a minor is or is⁤ likely to be ⁢present on the premises.”\n\nThe law also outlines several levels of potential prison time or fines, with higher penalties if a child uses an unsecured gun,⁢ injures themselves or someone ‌else, or ⁤causes a death. The law does make some exceptions, such as supervised use or acting in self-defense.\n\nAccording to the Giffords​ Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Michigan is‌ one of 21 U.S. states that have laws allowing criminal‍ charges‍ against ⁣individuals who fail to keep a gun inaccessible to a minor.\n\nThese laws,‌ often referred to as “child access prevention” laws, vary from state to state. In‍ some states,⁢ the ⁢law only applies if the ‌gun is discharged. Others have stricter laws that apply even if the gun is not fired or does not cause harm.\n\nState storage laws also define “minor” differently. In some states, teenagers older than 14 would not be considered a minor.\n\nThere is a lack of comprehensive national data on this issue.\n\nSome prosecutors view these laws as an unnecessary punishment, especially after a ‌child’s death. Others see it as a way to encourage other gun ‌owners⁤ to secure their weapons away from children.\n\nA 2017 investigation by the USA Today‌ Network and the Associated Press ⁢found that‍ prosecutors brought charges about ‌half the time ⁢from ‌2014 to 2016 in ​cases where ‍children under age 12 either killed themselves or were mistakenly‌ shot and⁣ killed by another child.\n\nThe investigation analyzed reports from all ⁣states, not just those with laws ⁢requiring⁤ certain types of gun ⁣storage.\n\nThe investigation ‍also found that the circumstances often didn’t seem to matter when comparing cases⁣ that resulted in charges to those that did not. But in nearly all cases where the gun owner had a felony record,⁤ prosecutors‍ did ⁢pursue charges.\n\nMichigan prosecutors have stated that​ Tolbert was prohibited from possessing firearms and ammunition due to multiple firearms-related felony convictions and drug-related convictions.\n\nIn another high-profile U.S.‌ case, the Virginia mother of ​a 6-year-old boy who shot his teacher initially ⁢faced charges of⁤ felony ​child neglect and a misdemeanor count of recklessly storing a firearm.‌ Prosecutors dropped the storage charge as part of a plea deal.\n\nErin Davis, ⁣senior counsel director of litigation at the⁢ anti-gun⁣ violence​ organization Brady, said laws aimed at ⁤gun storage ⁤are ‍educational tools, not a punishment.\n\n“It’s really analogous to requiring children to be in car seats or to wear seat belts,” ​Davis​ said. “The goal is to change behavior to save ⁣lives.”\n\nKelly Drane, research director at the Giffords Law Center, agreed.\n\n“While we don’t have hard data on ​this, lack of prosecutions doesn’t preclude the law‌ from⁤ working⁤ — it still sets a cultural standard that can help encourage more responsible behavior,” Drane said.\n\nEven in states without laws on gun storage or kids’ access, prosecutors have other options to criminally charge ⁢parents or caregivers.\n\nWe can’t measure a negative.\n\n–Kym ⁣Worthy, Wayne County Prosecutor\n\nMichigan’s most notable⁢ example is the involuntary manslaughter charges filed against James and Jennifer Crumbley ⁣after ⁤their son killed four of his high school classmates in 2021.\n\nJennifer Crumbley was found guilty this‌ month, marking the first time‌ a U.S. ⁣parent was held accountable for a child carrying out a mass school​ attack. James ​Crumbley faces ‌trial in March. He ​has pleaded not ‍guilty.\n\nExperts agree that the circumstances of this case are extreme. Prosecutors⁣ argue that the Crumbleys made a gun‌ accessible to their son, ignored his deteriorating mental health, and didn’t take him‍ home when ⁢school officials called them to the building to show the teen’s ​parents his ⁤concerning drawings the​ day of ​the attack.\n\nWayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy — whose jurisdiction ​includes ​Detroit and is the most populated in Michigan — has routinely brought charges of child abuse or involuntary ⁤manslaughter against parents after their children have killed or wounded themselves⁢ or others with an unsecured gun.\n\nThe latest charges were filed in December against the mother and father of a 5-year-old boy who was shot in the face. Detroit Police Chief James White told reporters the boy found the gun on top of a dresser and was jumping on a bed when ⁤it fired.\n\nWorthy said it’s easier to prove a violation of the new law beyond a reasonable doubt compared to prosecuting other potential charges in such cases. But it’s impossible to know​ whether the laws or the charges push more people to secure their guns,‍ she said.\n\n“We can’t measure a negative,” Worthy ⁤said, but she hopes that bringing​ attention to the laws “will be more of a deterrent.”","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/02/24/michigan-toddlers-shooting-incident-sheds-light-on-new-gun-storage-legislation-and-approaches-in-other-states/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Company Achieves First US Moon Landing Since Apollo Era, Lander ‘Healthy and Functioning","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4037-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — The latest visitor to the ​moon, Odysseus, is reported to be ⁤in⁤ good health and functioning well, a day after⁤ marking the‍ first U.S. landing on⁣ the lunar surface in 50 years.

This issue‍ is currently being considered by the justices⁤ in a case involving the bankruptcy ⁢of ‌OxyContin manufacturer‌ Purdue Pharma.\n\nThe Supreme Court will decide whether the owners​ of ⁢Purdue Pharma, members of the affluent⁣ Sackler family, ⁤can be granted immunity in exchange for paying up to $6 billion ​to settle thousands of⁤ lawsuits⁣ over the company’s alleged deceptive marketing of its potent pain medication.\n\nRetired‍ bankruptcy judge ⁤Barbara Houser, the ‌trustee ‌responsible for administering the Boy Scouts settlement, announced following the Supreme Court’s decision that she has “resumed all‌ operations, ⁤including the evaluation and payment‍ of claims.” The settlement trust ⁤has already disbursed ​nearly $8 million to ‍more than 3,000 abuse claimants.\n\nThe⁢ Boy Scouts expressed⁣ their approval‌ of ⁣the Supreme Court’s decision.\n\n“This‍ decision allows the trustee to resume her crucial work ‍of compensating survivors, and it provides a path for the BSA to continue its mission of delivering scouting to more than a million young ‍men and women⁣ across the country,” the organization stated.\n\nDouglas Kennedy, an‌ abuse survivor who co-led ‌the official committee representing ‍abuse claimants in the bankruptcy, described ⁢the Supreme Court’s swift ‍decision as good news, but acknowledged that it still represented “another emotionally wrenching twist” in the survivors’ years-long⁤ pursuit ⁤of closure.\n\n“We remain on ​tenterhooks waiting to see what the final resolution will be in the Purdue⁣ case,” Kennedy ⁣said.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/02/23/supreme-court-allows-2-46b-sex-abuse-settlement-for-boy-scouts-to-move-forward/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Rust’ armorer labeled as ‘negligent’; defense claims she’s being made a fall guy","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4006-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"From SANTA FE, N.M. — The chief ‌armorer for the⁢ film “Rust,” Hannah Gutierrez, was held accountable ⁤by a New Mexico prosecutor on Thursday⁣ for the tragic shooting ​incident that took⁢ place on the set in 2021, leading to the death of ⁢the‍ film’s cinematographer. However, her attorney argued that she was being unfairly⁢ blamed for the unfortunate event.\n\nDuring the opening statements of⁣ her involuntary manslaughter trial, Gutierrez,​ aged 27, maintained a calm demeanor. ‌She‍ stands accused of⁢ introducing​ live ammunition on the ‍film set,⁢ a practice that has⁤ been strictly prohibited for almost a hundred years.\n\nDespite pleading not guilty, Gutierrez’s legal‌ team informed ‍the jury, ​consisting of five women and seven men,‌ that she was being held responsible for a disorganized, low-budget production. They​ argued that she was overworked, her requests for additional firearms training were disregarded, and actor Alec Baldwin violated fundamental gun safety ⁣protocols by aiming the revolver at a person and firing.\n\nThe⁢ fatal shooting of Hutchins​ occurred when Baldwin‍ was practicing with a replica Colt .45 “Peacemaker” revolver, loaded with ⁤a ⁢live round by Gutierrez, on the Santa ‌Fe film set. Director ‍Joel Souza, who‍ was ‌also injured in the incident, survived.\n\nCharges against ‌Baldwin were initially dropped​ in April, only to be reinstated on January 19.

Each felony charge carries a potential prison sentence of up⁣ to 18 months.\n\nLewis presented photos of live rounds​ found‌ on the set as⁢ evidence, stating that they should have been easily identifiable due to their shiny nickel primers, or end caps, in contrast to​ the dull brass⁣ primers and⁣ aged appearance of the dummy ⁣rounds. He added that dummy ⁢rounds had holes in the side or ball ⁤bearings inside that ⁢would rattle when shaken.\n\nBowles refuted this, stating that many dummy rounds⁣ on the set also had nickel primers and some lacked ball bearings,‍ making them indistinguishable from live rounds.\n\nHe accused props supplier Seth Kenney of introducing ‍the live ⁤rounds to the set and props master Sarah Zachary, who was employed by⁣ Kenney, of tampering with the crime scene by discarding evidence ‍after the shooting.\n\nNeither Kenney ⁢nor Zachary have been charged,​ and prosecutors have stated ⁢that there is no evidence to suggest⁣ that Kenney supplied live rounds.

This was accomplished by firing its main rocket thruster for nearly seven⁤ minutes, as detailed in ⁢the company’s online statement.\n\nProvided everything proceeds as planned, the robotic spacecraft is set ⁤to gradually lower its orbit within the next 24 ⁤hours. It is scheduled to touch down ⁢at crater Malapert A, located near the‌ moon’s south pole, at 3:49 p.m. on​ Thursday.

This‍ rocket was constructed and launched by SpaceX, Elon Musk’s California-based company, from NASA’s ⁣Kennedy ​Space Center in ⁢Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nShould the landing ‍be successful, the IM-1 mission will be the first controlled descent to the lunar⁢ surface by a U.S. spacecraft since Apollo 17. This‍ was NASA’s last crewed moon mission, which saw Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt⁢ land on the moon in 1972.\n\nThis would also be the first “soft landing” ⁣on the moon by a commercially⁣ manufactured and operated vehicle.

This decision ​came in response to a Missouri agency’s attempt to overturn a victory by a lesbian employee in a workplace discrimination lawsuit.​ The case involved the exclusion of three potential jurors who,⁤ citing their Christian faith, expressed the⁢ belief that homosexuality is sinful.\n\nThe state ​officials ‍had sought a retrial after a lower court ​rejected their appeal.⁤ This followed a jury verdict⁢ in favor of ⁢the plaintiff, Jean Finney, in⁤ her lawsuit against the ​Missouri ⁤Department of Corrections. The state contended that the⁣ exclusion⁢ of the three individuals, who had voiced their religious opinions, contravened the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection under the law.\n\nFinney, a ⁤lesbian, filed a ‌lawsuit ​against the Department‍ of Corrections, her employer for many years. She alleged that she had been subjected​ to a pattern of ⁤workplace​ discrimination and retaliation after she ⁣started dating a male colleague’s ex-wife. Finney, who was seeking financial compensation, ⁣accused the agency of breaching Missouri’s human rights laws by fostering a hostile work environment‌ and discriminating against her based on her sex.\n\nIn‌ 2021, the ​jury ruled in Finney’s favor, awarding her a total of $275,000 for her ​claims of sexual discrimination and a hostile ‍work environment.\n\nDuring ⁣the jury‍ selection process, where potential⁢ jurors ⁢are questioned to uncover any potential bias, Finney’s attorney asked⁤ about their religious beliefs. This was ⁢done ‍in an attempt to “identify ⁣persons​ with strong feelings on the subject of homosexuality,” according to court documents submitted by Finney’s legal team.\n\nFinney’s lawyers requested‍ that Missouri state Judge Kate Schaefer dismiss the three jurors. They believed that the jurors’ responses to questions about whether homosexuality is a sin indicated a bias against gay individuals.\n\nJudge Schaefer stated that two of ​the ‌three jurors in question had been “very⁢ clear in ⁢that they could be absolutely fair and impartial in this case.”⁤ However, she agreed⁣ to exclude the ‌jurors to “err on ⁣the side of ‍caution.”\n\nThe judge approved the request despite⁢ an objection from Missouri officials.‍ Their attorneys expressed concerns about “getting into the⁣ bounds of religious discrimination” during the‌ jury selection ​process.\n\nFollowing the state’s ‍appeal, a‍ Missouri appellate⁤ court ⁢determined that the trial court had ​acted⁤ within the law. The court found that the​ dismissal of the potential jurors was based on their views on⁤ homosexuality⁣ — a “central issue in the case” — and not because they were Christians, ‌as ⁢Missouri officials had argued. After Missouri’s highest court rejected a ⁢subsequent appeal by state ⁤officials, they appealed to the Supreme ‌Court.\n\nMissouri officials argued to the justices that equal protection rights, which safeguard​ potential jurors from being dismissed based ⁣on sex or race, should also apply to religion. ⁣They ⁢added that the U.S. Constitution “ought not to tolerate exclusion on the basis‍ of religion, the very first ⁢freedom protected by the Bill ‍of Rights.”\n\nState officials admitted that⁣ potential jurors could be excluded ‍if specific religious beliefs, rather ⁣than simply the religion they follow, caused them to be biased.\n\nThe Supreme‍ Court, which has a 6-3 ​conservative majority, has recently adopted a⁢ broad interpretation of religious interests. This includes a decision last ⁢year that allowed an evangelical ‌Christian web design business owner to ⁤refuse‍ to ​provide ⁢services for ⁢same-sex‌ weddings.\n\nIn 2022, the court sided with a‌ public high school‌ football coach who was suspended for refusing to stop leading Christian prayers with players on the field after games.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/02/21/supreme-court-refrains-from-ruling-on-the-legality-of-religious-based-juror-exclusion/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Supreme Court Dismisses Appeal by 3 GOP House Members Regarding $500 Mask Penalties","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3796-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"From the heart​ of the nation, WASHINGTON — On⁣ Tuesday, the Supreme‍ Court made a significant decision.

The new Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which was‍ intended to simplify the process and expand access to college,‌ has proven to be more challenging than anticipated.\n\nMoreover, parents who will have multiple children in college during the 2024-25 academic year may be in for‌ a surprise when it comes to the​ cost.\n\nAs reported by CNN, “The FAFSA used to consist of as many as 108⁤ questions. However, with the new form, some applicants⁤ will only need to answer a minimum of 18 questions, which should take less than 10 minutes to complete, according to the ⁤Department of Education. Some data is now directly extracted from a filer’s tax return, eliminating the need for applicants to search for figures on old tax ⁣returns.”\n\nIt is projected that an additional ⁢1.5 million students will be eligible for the maximum Pell grant award, which ‍currently stands ⁢at $7,395 per annum.\n\nWhat’s new with ⁣FAFSA\n\nThe revised form now uses a student aid index, which can be⁢ either beneficial or detrimental for families, depending on ‍their income. As CNBC noted, “The new system will allow more low- and moderate-income students to access​ federal grants, but it will also reduce eligibility for some wealthier families.”\n\nFamilies with more than one⁤ student in college in 2024-2025 may experience additional financial pressure. The so-called “sibling discount,” which previously provided relief for families with two or ‍more children in college simultaneously, has been discontinued.\n\nInstead of dividing the expected ​family contribution to ‌college costs by the number of children in college, each child applying will receive an individual expected ⁤family contribution. This means that financial aid award letters ‌may not meet the expectations of some parents and students.\n\nHowever, Menaka Hampole, assistant professor of finance at Yale School of Management, told CNBC that this ​creates a “strong case” for appealing the award. She and other⁣ experts suggest that schools are often open to providing more aid on appeal, but families are frequently unaware ‌of‍ this.\n\nThe first step is ⁣to contact a school’s financial aid office and inquire about how to appeal a decision. Additionally,​ if another school has made a more attractive offer, a school may be willing to adjust its aid offer.\n\nRollout complications\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education has reported that only 4 million students had submitted ⁢their form by the end ‌of January, a small fraction of⁣ the 17 million typically submitted‍ in ‌a⁤ normal year. Most​ applications are usually completed by this time in a typical year.\n\nOn Monday, Feb. 12, the Los Angeles Times reported that “high school seniors and their‌ counselors are describing the situation as chaotic, disastrous, and frightening.”\n\nThe article mentioned that “sometimes parents and students would complete the form, but the system would not allow them to create an account, citing an error without ⁤specifying what​ it was. Those who didn’t complete the form on the first attempt or needed to correct ⁢a mistake were locked out.”\n\nParents without a Social Security number have often been unable ​to submit a form for their children, even if their children have Social Security numbers.⁤ And if someone filling out a form made any⁣ mistake — even⁤ a simple typo — they have to wait to correct it, further delaying their application.⁤ The FAFSA portal will not open for corrections​ until mid-March.\n\nMultiple news outlets have reported on students who have been trying unsuccessfully for weeks, and in some cases a month, to submit their federal financial aid form. Those who attempted to call the U.S. Department of Education’s help line often couldn’t get through or faced extremely long wait times to speak to a representative.\n\nDemands for action\n\nThe problematic process has caught the ‍attention of over 100 Democratic ​lawmakers, who have⁢ written to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, urging him to address the issues and ⁤streamline the process, as reported ​by The Washington Post⁢ and other media outlets. “Lawmakers are seeking clarity on how the ⁣department⁢ plans to communicate any further delays in processing the FAFSA and minimize the potential impact on students.”\n\nRepublican lawmakers are calling for the Government Accountability Office to investigate. The Post‌ quoted Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., chairwoman of the House Education Committee: “The reason students, parents, and⁢ schools ⁤are scrambling to deal with financial aid uncertainty is because of gross mismanagement by the department.”\n\nDue to the government’s delays in the financial aid process,⁣ schools ⁣like the University of California‍ and California State University have extended their deadlines for first-year students to accept their admission offers for the fall.\n\nAdjusting deadlines, reducing requirements\n\nIn a call with reporters, Cardona stated⁤ that his department is⁢ reducing some⁣ of the verification burden it places on colleges and universities so they can concentrate on processing and delivering student aid. The schools have traditionally had to verify income and⁤ other information on a percentage of applications as well as vet their own⁢ processes. ⁣That burden will be lighter for the time being.\n\n“Here’s the ‍bottom line: Fewer requirements for colleges and universities this spring means more time and resources freed up to deliver financial aid for‍ students to make the most of the improved FAFSA,” Cardona said.\n\nThe⁢ department made the new FAFSA available three months later than planned. And it now doesn’t plan to send students’ application information to the schools until March, which puts those ⁢schools behind in assigning​ financial ⁤aid and getting students to commit.\n\nInside Higher⁣ Education reported that “college⁢ officials were underwhelmed by the department’s initial support plan, which includes deploying teams of ⁣federal experts to under-resourced institutions.”‌ It reported that starting ⁢last week, the department selected institutions⁢ for‍ the additional help, using a number of criteria such as the percentage of ​students​ eligible⁢ for Pell grants.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/02/20/troubled-launch-of-federal-student-financial-aid-and-its-potential-discontent-among-larger-families/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Charlotte, a solitary stingray, is expecting at her mountain aquarium","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3775-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"Deep⁣ in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains​ in Hendersonville, N.C., a rust-hued stingray ‌named Charlotte, as large‌ as a dinner plate, has⁤ spent the majority of her life gracefully‌ navigating ⁣the waters of a ​local aquarium. Despite being ⁢a staggering 2,300 miles away from her natural home⁢ in the southern Californian ​waves, and having not encountered a male of her species for at least eight years, Charlotte is‌ miraculously⁣ pregnant.\n\n“Our beloved Charlotte is sending us a Valentine’s Day ⁣surprise by preparing to welcome some pups!” exclaimed Brenda Ramer, the executive director⁣ of the Aquarium and‌ Shark Lab⁢ located on Main Street in downtown Hendersonville.\n\nContrary to some media reports, Charlotte’s pregnancy is not the result of an unlikely interspecies romance with one of ⁤the five small sharks she shares her tank with. This was a playful suggestion made​ by‍ Ramer, but ​experts have⁣ confirmed that such a scenario ⁤would be impossible.\n\nThe aquarium, managed by Ramer’s ⁣educational nonprofit, Team ECCO, aims to⁣ inspire local schoolchildren and the wider⁤ community ⁤to develop ⁤a passion for science. Currently, the most significant lesson being taught is about parthenogenesis, a form of asexual reproduction where offspring develop from unfertilized eggs, eliminating the need for a male’s ⁢genetic contribution.\n\nThis rare phenomenon has been observed in certain insects, fish, amphibians, birds, ⁢and reptiles, but never in mammals. Documented instances include California condors, Komodo dragons, and yellow-bellied water snakes.\n\nKady Lyons, ⁢a research scientist at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, who is not affiliated with ⁢the North Carolina aquarium, stated that Charlotte’s pregnancy is the only known case of parthenogenesis in ‌round stingrays. However, ‌she is not surprised, as other types of sharks, skates, ⁣and rays have experienced similar pregnancies in ​captivity.\n\n“Nature has a way of making this happen,” Lyons said. “These animals are not cloning themselves. Instead, a female’s ‍egg fuses with another cell,⁢ triggering cell division and ⁤leading to‍ the creation of ⁣an embryo.”\n\nThe cell that fuses⁣ with the egg is known as a polar body. They are produced when a female ⁤is creating an egg but usually aren’t used. “We don’t know why it happens,”⁢ Lyons said. “Just that⁤ it’s kind ⁤of ‍this really neat phenomenon that they seem to be able to do.”\n\nInitially, Ramer and her team thought Charlotte had a tumor when they noticed a⁤ lump on her back that was “blowing up‌ like a biscuit.” However, an ultrasound revealed her pregnancy. “We were⁣ all ‌like, ‘Shut the back door. There’s no way,” Ramer said. “We thought we were overfeeding her.

The spokesperson went on to⁤ claim that Navalny was ⁣”murdered,” but the‍ location of his body remains unknown as his loved ones desperately seek ​answers.\n\nAt the age of​ 47, Navalny’s untimely death has left a gaping hole in the Russian​ opposition, just weeks before an election that is expected⁢ to extend ​President Vladimir Putin’s​ reign for another six‍ years.\n\nDespite the fact that neither Navalny, a staunch anti-corruption‌ advocate, nor other critics of ⁤the Kremlin were in a position to challenge Putin for the presidency, Navalny’s death is a devastating blow​ to those Russians who ⁤had placed their hopes for a brighter future on this⁤ seemingly⁢ tireless adversary of Putin. His‌ sudden death has ⁢also sparked questions about the cause. Russian officials informed Navalny’s team on Saturday that the cause of his death was still under investigation, with the results expected⁣ to be released next week, according to Navalny’s spokesperson,⁤ Kira‌ Yarmysh.

OVD-Info, a group that⁢ monitors political⁤ repression in Russia, reported on Saturday that more than 273 people had been detained at memorial events since Navalny’s death.\n\nMemorial items laid on Friday were⁣ removed overnight, but​ people continued⁣ to arrive with flowers on Saturday.

However, the next day, Romney ‌clarified that he has⁢ no intentions of running for president in 2024, let alone as Manchin’s vice president.\n\nWhen the Deseret News inquired about Romney’s ideal third-party candidate to compete⁣ against probable 2024 presidential candidates President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, he responded, “I would welcome any ​Republican candidate, except President Trump.”\n\nRomney’s‌ Preference for ⁤GOP Presidential Candidates —⁣ Excluding Trump and Ramaswamy\n\n“There were several individuals who contested in the Republican primary for president.‌ I​ would⁢ have supported any of them, except perhaps‍ Vivek Ramaswamy, and would have been pleased to see them leading our⁤ party,” ‍stated ⁣the Utah senator.

The community is not​ considered to be⁣ at risk. Despite ‍receiving treatment, the ⁢cat did not‌ survive.\n\nWhile not common, the plague is not entirely rare in ⁢the‌ western United States, with a few cases reported⁢ annually. This disease is distinct from Alaskapox, a rare ⁣disease that recently claimed‍ a life in Alaska.\n\nUnderstanding the Bubonic⁤ Plague\n\nThe⁣ plague is an infectious disease that can affect mammals. It is caused by the⁤ bacterium​ Yersinia ‍pestis, which is typically carried by‍ rodents and⁢ fleas. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease ‌Control‍ and Prevention, sunlight and drying can kill ​the‍ plague⁢ bacteria on surfaces. Humans and pets suspected of having the plague are usually treated with⁢ antibiotics, and occasionally with other medical interventions.\n\nThe symptoms of the plague can‍ vary.⁢ Bubonic plague, the type contracted by the Oregon resident, occurs when the ⁤plague bacteria infects the lymph nodes. This can result in fever, headache,‍ weakness, and painful,⁤ swollen lymph nodes. It is usually​ contracted through the bite of an infected​ flea, ‍as per the CDC.\n\nSepticemic plague occurs if‍ the⁤ bacteria enters the bloodstream. ⁢It can develop initially or after bubonic plague goes untreated. This form of ⁤the plague can cause fever, chills, weakness, ​abdominal pain, shock, and sometimes other symptoms like bleeding into the skin and blackened‌ fingers, toes, or the nose.⁢ The ⁢CDC states that this form can be contracted from⁣ flea bites or from handling an infected⁢ animal.\n\nPneumonic plague is the most severe form of the disease, occurring when the bacteria infects the lungs.⁣ This form of the plague can ‌cause rapidly developing pneumonia. It is the only form of the⁣ plague that ⁣can be spread from person to person through the inhalation of infectious droplets.\n\nAll forms of ⁣the plague can ‍be treated with common antibiotics. ⁢Early treatment significantly improves the chances of ⁤a full recovery, according to the CDC.\n\nAssessing the Risk of⁤ Infection\n\nIn the U.S., the CDC reports an average of seven human plague⁢ cases each year, with about 80% of ⁢these being the⁤ bubonic form of⁢ the disease. Most ⁤of these cases​ occur in the rural western⁣ and ⁢southwestern U.S.\n\nIn ‌2012, a welder in central Oregon contracted the disease after removing a rodent from his choking cat’s‌ mouth. He survived ‍but lost his fingertips and toes to the disease. A Colorado teen contracted a fatal case while⁤ hunting ​in 2015, and Colorado⁣ officials confirmed at least ⁣two cases last ⁢year — one of ‍them fatal.\n\nPeople⁣ can reduce the risk of plague by making their homes and ⁣outdoor living areas less attractive ⁤to rodents. This can be achieved ‍by‍ clearing brush and junk⁣ piles and keeping pet food inaccessible. Ground squirrels, chipmunks, and wood rats, along with other rodents, can carry the plague. Therefore, individuals‍ with bird and squirrel feeders should consider the risks if ⁢they live in areas with a plague outbreak.\n\nThe CDC recommends‌ using‍ repellent with DEET to ‌protect against rodent fleas when⁢ camping or working outdoors. Flea control ‌products‌ can ‌help ⁣prevent household pets‍ from becoming⁢ infected. If ⁢a pet falls ill, it should be‌ taken to⁤ a vet as soon as possible, as per ​the CDC’s ‌advice.\n\nThe Black Death in the 14th‌ century was perhaps the ‍most infamous plague epidemic, ‌killing up to half of the population as it spread through Europe, the Middle East, and northern ‌Africa. It began devastating ‍communities ‍in the Middle East‌ and Europe between 1347 and​ 1351, and significant outbreaks continued for roughly the ​next 400 years.\n\nWhile the⁢ plague remains a serious illness,⁢ antibiotics and supportive therapy are effective for even the most dangerous pneumonic form when patients are‌ treated in time, according ‍to ​the World Health Organization.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/02/14/plague-diagnosis-in-oregon-understanding-the-disease/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Democrats aim to reclaim US House seat left by Santos, diminish Republican majority","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3639-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"From the heart of WASHINGTON —‍ The Democratic ​Party is gearing up‌ to chip‍ away at the ‍slim majority⁢ held by Republicans in the U.S. House of​ Representatives.

These decisions come at a time when federal and⁢ state legislators⁢ are exploring ways ​to ⁣mitigate the ‍potential harm social⁢ media can inflict on the mental well-being of children.\n\nDave Yost, Ohio’s Republican attorney general, had defended the state’s Social Media Parental Notification Act, passed in July, as a legitimate effort‍ to shield minors from mental health ‍risks and sexual‍ predators.\n\nHowever, Judge Marbley concurred‌ with NetChoice, whose‌ membership includes TikTok, Elon Musk’s⁤ X, Alphabet’s YouTube, and Meta’s Facebook and Instagram.‌ He​ stated that the law was “not narrowly tailored‌ to those ends.”\n\nHe further commented, “Barring minors under ⁣16 from accessing all content on websites that the act aims to regulate, without explicit parental consent, is an excessively broad approach to mitigating the harm social media can cause to children.”\n\nThe ruling on Monday has indefinitely suspended Ohio’s law while the lawsuit⁤ proceeds.

This city has ⁤become a‌ refuge for approximately 1.4 million Palestinians who​ have⁣ fled from⁢ the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas ​that ⁢has been raging​ for four months.\n\nIsrael has been hinting that⁤ its ​ground offensive⁤ in⁢ Gaza may soon shift its focus to Rafah, a densely populated city situated on the Egyptian border. On Sunday, the White House announced that President Joe Biden had ‌cautioned ​Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against launching a‍ military ‌operation ⁢against Hamas in Rafah without a solid and feasible⁤ plan to safeguard ‍civilians.\n\nThe strikes targeted the vicinity of Kuwait Hospital early Monday morning,‌ according to an Associated Press journalist stationed in Rafah. Some of the‍ injured from the strikes were transported‍ to the ‌hospital for treatment.\n\nThe Israeli ‍military confirmed that it had targeted “terror ⁢sites in the Shaboura area” — a ⁢district in Rafah. The military statement did not provide further details about the targets or the potential damage or casualties, only stating that the‌ series‌ of strikes had concluded.\n\nPalestinian ⁤health officials have yet‌ to provide any information ‍regarding‍ casualties.\n\nBiden’s comments represent his strongest stance⁢ yet on the potential operation. Last week, Biden criticized Israel’s military response in⁣ Gaza as ⁣”excessive,” and called for “immediate⁤ and specific” measures⁢ to bolster ‌humanitarian ⁢aid. According to Israel’s‌ Channel 13 ⁢television, the conversation between Biden and Netanyahu lasted for 45 minutes.\n\nA senior U.S. administration official revealed ⁢that much of the call was spent discussing the potential ⁤for a cease-fire agreement. After weeks of diplomatic efforts, a “framework” is now “largely” in place for⁣ a deal that ‍could‍ result in the release of remaining​ hostages held by Hamas in exchange⁤ for a cessation of ‍hostilities.\n\nThe official, ‍who‌ requested anonymity to discuss the‍ negotiations, admitted that “gaps remain,” but declined to provide further details. The official also noted that recent military ‍pressure on Hamas in ‌the southern city of Khan Younis has brought ⁤the group closer to accepting a deal.\n\nNetanyahu’s office did not comment on the ​call. Earlier, Hamas’ ​Al-Aqsa television station quoted ‌an unnamed Hamas official who warned that any invasion of Rafah would “derail” the talks mediated by the ‌United States, ​Egypt,‌ and Qatar.\n\nBiden and⁢ Netanyahu’s conversation occurred after two Egyptian officials ‍and ‍a Western diplomat revealed that Egypt had ⁤threatened to suspend⁤ its peace treaty with Israel​ if troops were deployed in Rafah. Egypt is concerned that‌ fighting​ could force Palestinians into⁢ the Sinai ⁢Peninsula and necessitate the closure of Gaza’s primary aid supply ⁤route.\n\nThe threat to suspend the Camp David Accords, a key pillar of regional stability for nearly ⁣half a century, came after​ Netanyahu stated that deploying troops into Rafah was necessary to​ win the four-month ⁣war against Hamas. He claimed ⁤that Hamas has four‌ battalions stationed there.\n\nMore than half of Gaza’s population‌ of 2.3 million have sought refuge in Rafah to‌ escape fighting in other ​areas. They are crammed into tent camps and shelters run ⁣by the U.N. Egypt is worried ​about a potential mass influx ‍of Palestinian refugees who may never be allowed to return.\n\nNetanyahu​ told “Fox News Sunday”‌ that there’s⁣ “ample space north of Rafah for them to relocate to” after Israel’s offensive elsewhere in ⁢Gaza. He added that Israel would guide ‍evacuees with “leaflets, mobile ⁣phones, and⁢ safe corridors among other things.”‍ However, the offensive has ⁤caused widespread⁣ destruction, leaving little capacity to accommodate people.\n\nThe standoff between Israel and ‍Egypt, ⁢two ​close U.S. allies, has emerged ‍as aid groups warn that an ⁤offensive in ⁢Rafah would exacerbate the already dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. Approximately​ 80% of residents have fled their homes, and the U.N. reports that a​ quarter⁢ of the population is at risk of starvation.\n\nA ground operation in Rafah could sever one of the only‍ routes for delivering food⁣ and medical supplies. Wael Abu⁣ Omar,​ a spokesman for the Palestinian‍ Crossings ‌Authority, reported that forty-four trucks of aid entered Gaza on Sunday. ⁢This is a significant decrease‌ from the approximately 500 trucks that‌ entered daily before the war.\n\nOfficials, who​ requested anonymity due to the sensitive⁣ nature of the negotiations, revealed that‌ Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and other countries have also warned of severe consequences if Israel invades Rafah.\n\n“An Israeli offensive on Rafah would ⁢result in an unimaginable humanitarian disaster and serious tensions with Egypt,” wrote European Union​ foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on X. Human Rights Watch stated that⁤ forced displacement constitutes a war crime.\n\nIsrael and Egypt have fought five wars before signing the Camp David Accords, brokered by ‍the U.S., in the late 1970s. The agreement includes provisions governing the deployment of forces on both sides of the heavily fortified border.\n\nEgyptian​ officials are concerned that if the border is breached, the military would be unable to prevent a flood of people fleeing into the Sinai Peninsula.\n\nThe United ⁣Nations reports that Rafah, which normally has a population of fewer than 300,000,⁣ is now ⁤hosting an ‌additional 1.4 million people and is “severely overcrowded.”\n\nInside Rafah, some displaced ⁣people ⁢are on the move again. Rafat and Fedaa Abu⁤ Haloub, who fled from Beit Lahia in the north earlier in the ‍war, loaded their belongings​ onto a truck. “We don’t know where we can safely take him,” Fedaa said of their baby. “Every month we have to move.”\n\nOm Mohammad Al-Ghemry, displaced from Nuseirat, expressed her‌ hope that Egypt would not allow Israel to‌ force Palestinians to flee into the Sinai “because we​ do not want ⁣to leave.”\n\nHeavy fighting continues in central ⁤Gaza and Khan Younis.\n\nOn Sunday, Gaza’s Health‌ Ministry‍ reported that the bodies⁤ of 112 people killed across the territory had been brought ⁢to hospitals in the past 24 hours. The death toll since the ​start of the war stands ⁤at 28,176. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and fighters but states that the majority of those killed were ​women and children.\n\nThe ​war ‍began ⁢with a Hamas attack into southern Israel on Oct. 7, during which Palestinian⁣ militants killed approximately ‍1,200 people and abducted around 250. Over 100 hostages ⁢were released during ⁣a cease-fire in November.\n\nHamas has stated that it will not release⁤ more hostages⁢ unless Israel ends its offensive and withdraws ⁤from Gaza. Netanyahu has rejected both demands.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/02/12/rafah-targeted-by-israeli-attacks-following-bidens-demand-for-netanyahu-to-devise-a-credible-civilian-protection-plan/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Pizza Hut’s ‘Goodbye Pies’ campaign aims to help ease your heartbreak troubles","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3508-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"NEW YORK — Is your relationship teetering on the edge?⁢ Pizza Hut ‍is‌ offering a unique way⁤ to bid adieu​ with a Hot Honey pizza.\n\nOn ‍Tuesday, Pizza Hut rolled out its innovative “Goodbye Pies” campaign. ⁢This initiative allows customers to send a complimentary Pizza Hut delivery to their‍ former​ flame’s address.

Miraculously, three individuals survived the⁤ crash: crew member​ Sydney Ann Bosmans, 23, and passengers Aaron‍ Baker, 35, and Audra Green, 23, both hailing from⁢ Columbus,⁢ Ohio. They were promptly transported to a local hospital‍ to receive treatment for their injuries, though their ⁢current conditions remain undisclosed.\n\nJust moments before the private jet met its fiery end ​on a Florida highway, the pilot ‍had⁤ composedly informed an airport controller that the aircraft “was not ⁤going to ‍make ‍the runway” due to the failure of both engines.\n\nThe jet, carrying five⁣ souls, was ‍en route to the airport in Naples when it attempted ⁤an emergency landing on Interstate 75 on ‍Friday afternoon. ​Eyewitnesses recount a horrifying scene as it collided with a vehicle ​— the⁣ wing of the plane dragging a car before violently slamming into a wall.⁢ An explosion ensued, with flames and black ⁤smoke billowing from the⁤ wreckage.\n\nFederal authorities have since initiated an investigation into ​the⁣ crash, which occurred near Naples, ‌just ‌north of where the interstate veers east toward Fort Lauderdale along the infamous Alligator Alley.\n\nThe ill-fated plane had ⁤departed from an airport at Ohio State University⁢ in Columbus, ​Ohio, around ⁢1 p.m. It was expected to touch​ down in Naples around the time of⁣ the crash, ⁣according to‍ Naples Airport Authority ⁤spokesperson​ Robin ⁣King.

Adhering to the school’s ⁢guidelines, Dorsey-Hollins ⁢ensured her daughter stayed home whenever she had a cough, a sore throat, or any other illness, until she was ​fully‍ recovered.\n\nAs the school year was‌ drawing to a close,‍ the school authorities‌ in Fort Worth, Texas, summoned her to discuss the high number of absences her daughter⁤ had accumulated.\n\nDuring the ⁢height of the pandemic, ⁢schools ⁤were adamant that parents and⁤ children should stay​ home at the slightest sign of illness. However, even though the emergency situation has subsided, Dorsey-Hollins claims that no one has clarified whether these rules have been revised.\n\n“The situation ⁤is incredibly​ perplexing,” she expressed.\n\n“In the past, ⁢if the child didn’t have a fever over 100, then it was deemed acceptable to send them to school,” ⁣said the mother of a 5-‍ and 13-year-old. “But now⁤ it seems like ​if they have a cough or they’re sneezing, you ⁢might ⁢want to keep them home. So, which is ⁤the ‌correct approach?”\n\nThe inconsistency in guidance on when to keep⁣ children home has only exacerbated ‌the confusion, which many believe is contributing to the nationwide epidemic⁢ of chronic‌ school ⁢absences.⁣ Some advocates, school systems, and even the state of California ‍are now⁣ encouraging children to attend‌ school even if ⁢they have minor illnesses ​like a cold, lice, or pinkeye.\n\nHedy Chang, the executive director of Attendance Works, a national nonprofit aimed at improving school attendance, believes that families need to understand that they no longer need to keep their⁢ children home at the slightest sign of⁣ illness.​ The organization‍ has issued its own guidance, urging parents to send ‍their children to school if they are capable of participating in ⁤daily activities.\n\n‘Navigating the Challenge’\n\n“We now have to re-engage children‌ and families and ⁢alter their perception about this,” Chang⁣ stated.\n\nThe American Academy of ‍Pediatrics advises that​ children⁣ should stay home ⁣if they ‌have a fever, vomiting or ​diarrhea, or ⁤if ‌they “are not‍ well enough to participate​ in⁢ class.”\n\nStriking the right balance is a​ challenge, and it’s understandable⁣ that different places⁤ would have different approaches, said ⁤Claire McCarthy, a⁣ pediatrician at Boston Children’s‌ Hospital and professor at Harvard ​Medical School.\n\n“Each school or school district has a different tolerance for illness,” McCarthy noted.\n\nThis leaves many parents ‍feeling ‍bewildered.\n\n“It’s a struggle,” ⁣admitted Malika ‍Elwin, a mother ⁤of a second grader on New York’s Long Island.\n\nShe doesn’t want to risk exposing other children or overburden the teacher with her daughter’s runny nose, so⁢ she’s ⁣kept her daughter ‌home‍ longer even though she’s feeling better because she still has cold symptoms. “Then ⁣I regret that because she just runs around here all day perfectly fine,” she confessed.\n\nFor those‍ who test positive for⁤ COVID-19, the CDC still recommends staying home and isolating for​ at⁣ least five days. However,‍ guidance from states and individual‍ schools varies widely. In some school ⁣systems, ⁤guidance allows ​for ​students‍ who test positive​ to go to school as ‍long as they are asymptomatic.\n\n‘A Shift in Perspective’\n\nSome ​authorities have reassessed their tolerance for illness. During‌ the 2021-2022 ⁢school year, more than a quarter‍ of students missed ‌at least 10% of the school year, up from 15%⁣ before the‍ pandemic.\n\nMissing‍ that much⁤ school puts students at risk of not learning ‌to read or graduate. Absent‍ students also miss out on meals, social interaction with peers and caring adults, ‍physical ‍exercise,​ and ‍access to mental health counseling ⁢and⁢ health care.​ In other words, missing school has its own health effects.\n\nAnd when a class sees high levels of chronic absenteeism, ⁤it affects the students who are present because‍ a teacher has to spend time reorienting the students who have been away.\n\nNoha Aboelata, who leads the Roots ‍Community Health Center in Oakland, California, said that the shift in guidance could disproportionately impact low-income communities and people of color. People in these communities⁣ might be more⁤ likely to live in multigenerational homes, take crowded public transportation or have poor ventilation in their ⁣homes. When ​people are out and about while sick,⁤ vulnerable loved ones could be put at risk.\n\nShe had hoped that the lessons ‍learned during the pandemic about staying home when contagious and taking care of ‍oneself and one’s family when sick would persist beyond the public health emergency. Instead, she said, “it feels‌ like the pendulum is swinging fiercely back in‌ the other direction.”\n\nBut changing the culture‍ around school ‍absences⁢ goes beyond⁣ just issuing guidance.\n\nSome schools in ⁣San Diego ‌County ⁢seem unaware of California’s new guidance allowing kids to ‌attend school ‌while mildly sick, said Tracy‍ Schmidt, who oversees attendance for the county ⁢Office ⁣of Education.\n\nHowever, others have adopted it and have begun discussing symptoms with parents who call to report their children are⁤ sick,​ urging‍ them to bring them in and see how‍ it goes. It ‍gives her hope that as more schools and parents learn about this‍ guidance, students will miss less school.\n\n“The most important place for⁢ our kids to be is⁤ school,” she emphasized. “We need to abandon this mindset that we had ‌to adopt during the pandemic because we were ⁢in a public safety emergency.”\n\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

The investigation is ongoing, with no arrests made as of yet.\n\n“Our station has always been known as ⁣the sound of Walker County, and with our station currently off-air, it feels as though⁣ our community has been robbed of its voice,” lamented WJLX General Manager Brett Elmore in a conversation with the Associated Press.​ “This is a painful blow, not⁣ just for us, ⁤but for our entire community.”\n\nThe theft was ⁤discovered on Feb. 2, when a maintenance crew arrived at the secluded, wooded ‍location ‌where the tower once proudly stood, only to find it missing. To add ​insult to injury, ‍every piece of broadcasting equipment stored in a nearby building had also vanished.\n\n“To invade my building, steal all my equipment, and the tower?” Elmore questioned. ⁣”Why‍ not leave the tower — it’s the most costly item⁢ to replace.”\n\nElmore theorizes that the tower’s guy-wire was severed first, causing the structure to collapse. He suspects it was then cut into manageable ⁤pieces and carted away. “With some basic tools from Home Depot, this could be dismantled‌ in no time,” he added.\n\nUnfortunately, the station had no insurance on the tower or the ​equipment. Elmore estimates that it will cost between $60,000 to $100,000 to rebuild. “We’re a​ small market, we simply don’t have that kind of money,” ⁢he admitted.\n\nDespite the setback, Elmore has received messages of support from across the country, and a GoFundMe page has been set up to raise donations.

During the interview, Putin expressed his belief that Western leaders have come ‌to ‌understand the futility of⁢ attempting to strategically defeat Russia, leaving them pondering their next move.\n\n“We are prepared for this dialogue,” Putin stated⁤ confidently.\n\nFurthermore, Putin expressed optimism about the possibility of reaching⁢ an agreement to⁢ release U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich from the Wall​ Street Journal, who has been held in Russia for almost a year ⁣on charges of espionage.\n\nThe‍ Russian President’s comments were part of a comprehensive interview that lasted over​ two hours with conservative talk-show ⁣host Tucker Carlson. ⁣The interview took place in ​Moscow on Tuesday and was broadcasted on tuckercarlson.com.\n\nWhen questioned about the possibility of deploying Russian troops⁣ to ​Poland, a NATO member, Putin responded:\n\n“Only in one case, if⁤ Poland attacks Russia. ​Why? Because we​ have no‍ interest in​ Poland, Latvia or anywhere else. Why would we do that? We simply don’t have any interest.”\n\nPutin, speaking in Russian⁣ with his⁣ comments translated into ⁢English, began with extensive remarks ⁣about Russia’s relations with⁣ Ukraine, Poland, and other countries.\n\nPutin spent a significant portion of the interview expressing‌ his frustration that Ukraine had been close ‌to agreeing‍ to a deal to end hostilities⁢ at talks in Istanbul​ in April 2022, but backed ⁢out once Russian troops ⁣withdrew from near Kyiv.\n\n“Well now let them think how to reverse the situation,” he said. “We’re not against it.

The interview was aired⁤ on‌ the same day ⁢Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy replaced the popular army chief with his ground forces commander.\n\nA procedural vote in the U.S. ⁤Senate has advanced a bill that⁣ includes $61 billion in ⁤new funds for Ukraine, but its future is ⁢uncertain in the⁢ Republican-dominated House of Representatives.

Curtis, along ⁢with other ​Republicans, holds the Biden administration responsible for this ‍situation.\n\n“I arrived today with a clear objective — to understand the control dynamics of the border. ‌What I ⁤discovered ‌is that the border is controlled — ‍not by the U.S. government,‍ but‌ by the (drug) cartels. They dictate who enters, when they enter, and where they enter the United ⁢States,” Curtis, who represents Utah’s 3rd District, stated.\n\nAs the issue of inadequate security ⁣and a ⁢surge​ in illegal entries ‍from‍ Mexico continues to heat up, and U.S. lawmakers grapple with solutions, Curtis made a trip‌ to the border for a firsthand experience. Accompanied by 12 other Republican U.S. House members, this marked ⁢his third visit to the ​border.\n\nAccording to Curtis, the influx of ​drugs across the border is perhaps the most significant challenge Utah faces ‍due to insufficient security. “We have witnessed this in Utah.⁤ The (Utah) Highway⁤ Patrol has some alarming statistics ‍about the increase in fentanyl and fentanyl-related deaths,” ‌he‍ noted.\n\nRecent statistics from⁤ the U.S. ‍Drug ⁣Enforcement Administration highlight the ​severity of the fentanyl ⁤issue. Last year, fentanyl seizures in Utah,‌ Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming totaled approximately 3.4 million pills, with 664,200 seized in Utah alone. This marks ⁣a significant increase from​ 1.9 million pills in 2022 across the four states and​ 565,200 ​in 2021. The majority of the‍ fentanyl originates from⁤ two Mexican drug groups, the Sinaloa and Jalisco ⁢cartels. The ⁢DEA report⁣ stated that fentanyl is now the ⁤leading cause of death⁤ for Americans aged 18-45.\n\n“These criminal cartels, these‍ organized transnational organizations, are tearing our country apart one pill at ⁣a⁢ time, one entry at ⁢a time,” Mark Dannels, the Cochise County, Arizona, ⁣sheriff and another witness​ at⁣ Thursday’s field⁤ hearing, stated.\n\nU.S. Representative Tom Tiffany, R-Wisconsin, who led ⁤the hearing,⁢ stated that fentanyl claims⁣ the lives of ‍70,000 people in the United States ⁢annually.\n\n“It’s not difficult to comprehend how ‍fentanyl is flooding our​ country when the border checkpoints ‍are unmanned because⁤ they’re occupied with⁣ other tasks,” he said. He accused the Biden administration of letting the situation spiral out of control.\n\nOn Wednesday, ‍the U.S. Senate rejected a Republican-proposed plan ‌to ‌strengthen border security. Curtis acknowledged​ that devising​ a plan to address the issue could be challenging, given the ⁤severity of⁢ the problem.\n\n“That’s a tough question,” he‍ said, contemplating the likelihood of a bill that could garner sufficient Democratic and​ Republican support to⁢ pass. “I’m an optimistic person. While the odds ‌may ‌be against us, it won’t deter me from trying.”\n\nCurtis believes that HR2, a ​border ⁣security measure ‌passed by the U.S. House last⁤ May, could serve as a starting point. The measure,‍ which is yet to be considered in the‍ U.S. Senate, proposes limits on asylum eligibility ‍and advocates for renewed efforts to⁢ construct ‌a wall along ​the U.S.-Mexico border. More broadly, Curtis advocates ​for a return to the “remain in Mexico” policy ​implemented⁣ under former President Donald Trump, which required asylum seekers to stay in Mexico while their ⁣requests were processed.\n\n“I suspect that many in the Senate,⁢ particularly Senate ⁤Republicans, would support HR2,” Curtis said. “It’s ⁣the only thing that’s passed one of⁢ the bodies,⁤ so it’s a great starting point.”\n\nLast Sunday, Governor Spencer Cox ‌visited the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas with 13 other Republican governors, expressing ⁣concern over the state of border security. U.S.​ Representatives Celeste Maloy and Burgess ⁣Owens, who represent Utah’s 2nd and 4th Congressional Districts, respectively, visited the border at Eagle‍ Pass, Texas, on January‌ 3.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/02/09/rep-john-curtis-the-danger-of-fentanyl-amplifies-the-importance-of-us-mexico-border-security-for-utah/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Military Confirms Death of 5 Marines in Helicopter Crash near San Diego","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3445-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"SAN DIEGO — The U.S. military⁤ confirmed on ⁢Thursday the tragic loss of five Marines who were aboard a helicopter ⁣that⁢ crashed during⁤ a storm in the mountains outside of San Diego.\n\nThe CH-53E Super Stallion, the ⁣helicopter⁤ in question, disappeared late Tuesday night while returning to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar ​in San Diego after a training session at Creech Air Force⁣ Base, located northwest of Las Vegas.\n\n“It is with ⁢immense sorrow and deep regret that I announce the passing of five exceptional Marines from the 3d Marine Aircraft Wing and the⁣ ‘Flying Tigers’,” stated Maj. ‌Gen.

For ⁣instance,⁤ the ​annual ⁤list price of‌ Eliquis, a stroke-preventing blood thinner from Bristol Myers⁣ Squibb,‍ is ⁣a ​staggering $7,100 in the U.S. However, in Japan, it’s only $940; in ⁤Canada, it’s $900;‍ and in ⁣France, it’s a mere $650.\n\nSimilarly, Johnson ‍& Johnson’s arthritis ‍medication, ​Stelara, has an annual list⁢ price of $79,000 in the U.S. In​ contrast, it’s priced at​ $30,000 in Germany, $20,000 in Canada,‍ and ⁣$12,000 in France.\n\nMoreover, the annual list price of Merck’s cancer ​treatment, Keytruda,⁤ is ​$191,000 in the U.S., ⁣while in the UK, it’s $115,000; in ⁢Canada, it’s $112,000; and in Japan, it’s just ⁢$44,000.\n\nSen. Sanders, an independent from Vermont, released the report ⁤in anticipation of a hearing on⁣ Thursday with⁤ the CEOs of the three pharmaceutical companies before ​the Senate Committee on ⁤Health, Education, Labor and⁤ Pensions,⁤ which he chairs. The ⁤hearing has already sparked controversy,⁤ with Sanders⁣ threatening ​to issue the committee’s first subpoenas in over four decades to force the heads of‍ Johnson & Johnson and Merck to ‍testify. They eventually agreed to appear voluntarily late last month.\n\nMedicare Begins Drug Price Negotiations\n\nMedications are typically far ⁢less expensive in other ⁢countries, largely because their governments often regulate the cost. However, this price gap could start to narrow‍ for certain drugs in ‍the near future.\n\nMedicare‌ has initiated its first-ever negotiations with pharmaceutical companies over the cost of 10 high-priced drugs, including‌ Eliquis ⁤and ⁢Stelara. While the⁢ prices​ charged⁣ in other​ countries are not‍ considered in the negotiation process, the Biden administration,⁣ Sanders, ⁣and others have consistently highlighted this price ​differential as a significant ⁣issue⁣ with the ⁣U.S. drug pricing system.\n\nDuring his tenure, former President Donald Trump proposed a measure that would have made Medicare pay the same price for certain costly prescription drugs⁣ as‍ other⁣ developed nations, a concept known as a ⁣”most-favored-nation price.” This would have enabled the U.S. to benefit from discounts negotiated by other ‌countries.\n\nAlthough the price patients pay for drugs usually depends‍ on their insurance coverage, list prices do⁣ influence both their premiums‍ and out-of-pocket expenses.

A police officer, who had previously pointed her gun at them, was‍ now handcuffing‌ two⁢ of them. The youngest among them, wearing a pink tiara, clung ​to her teenage cousin’s hand in⁤ fear.\n\nBrittney Gilliam, the mother of six-year-old ‌Lovely, watched helplessly as​ she was⁤ handcuffed and escorted ⁤to a patrol car. The police ​had mistakenly identified her car as stolen,​ leading to this unfortunate incident.\n\nFast forward three years,⁣ Gilliam has accepted a $1.9⁣ million settlement from the city officials of ‍Aurora, a suburb in Denver. This settlement was in response to a lawsuit that accused the police ‍officers of ⁤”profound and systematic” racism. The family’s lawyer, David Lane, made this announcement‍ on Monday.\n\nLane stated that the settlement spared the girls the distress of reliving the traumatic incident during a ‌trial. The settlement amount will be equally divided among the group, with the girls’ shares being invested in annuities. This will‍ allow‌ the money to grow by the ⁤time they turn 18 and can access‌ it.\n\n“All‌ parties are very ‌satisfied with this settlement,” Lane commented.\n\nHowever, a spokesperson ‍for the city of Aurora did ‍not immediately comment on the settlement.\n\nThe incident, which ​occurred on a summer day in 2020, was supposed to be a fun girls’ day out. Instead, it turned into⁣ a traumatic experience for Gilliam, her daughter, her sister, and two nieces.\n\nProsecutors found no evidence of the officers committing any crimes, as they ⁣were following ⁣their training for conducting a high-risk stop of a suspected stolen vehicle. However, they acknowledged that the incident was “unacceptable and preventable” and urged the ⁢police to⁢ review ‍their policies to prevent⁤ such incidents in the future.\n\nDarian Dasko, one of the officers‌ involved in the incident, ​was suspended for 160 hours. He and the other officer, Madisen Moen, continue to work for ​the department.\n\nThe video footage ⁤of​ the young girls lying face‌ down and being handcuffed sparked ⁤outrage, especially in the wake of protests ⁤over racial injustice triggered by the killing of ⁢George Floyd.\n\nThis settlement is not the first ⁤time Aurora has​ had to pay for ⁣police misconduct. ‌In 2021, the city settled ⁤for $15 ‌million with the parents of‌ Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man who was killed in 2019 after being stopped, placed in a‌ neck hold, and injected with a sedative. One police officer was convicted in his death, ‌while two others were acquitted.⁣ Two paramedics‍ were also convicted.\n\n‘You have to use common sense’\n\nA state civil rights investigation,⁤ launched in response to the ⁣outrage⁢ over McClain’s death, found a ⁣deeply ingrained culture of racially biased policing in the department.\n\nLane expressed ⁣hope that the ⁣settlement ⁣would send a​ message to law enforcement agencies ⁤across the country about the need for discretion in their responses.\n\n“You can’t be robocop and be​ an effective cop. You have to use common sense,” he stated.\n\nThe day that turned into⁢ a nightmare for Gilliam’s girls​ had started with⁤ a trip to a nail ⁢salon. However, they found it ‌closed. As Gilliam ‌was searching for another salon on her phone, officers approached their car with guns drawn and ordered her and a passenger ⁣to roll down their windows and put their hands out.\n\nThe officers were ⁤unable to see who else was inside the car due to the tinted windows. ‍Eventually, everyone was ordered out​ and made to lie on the ground.\n\nGilliam protested, “You don’t have to do all that. You don’t have to do all that,” as captured by the body camera⁢ footage.\n\n“OK. OK, we’ll deal with that,” Dasko responded.\n\n“Don’t tell me it’s OK!” Gilliam retorted.\n\nAbout a dozen bystanders gathered to watch the incident, with some recording it on their phones.\n\n‘It’s for our safety’\n\nThe⁢ video footage showed the police appearing​ confused about how to handle the situation when ‌they realized​ children were inside the SUV. Moen, who had just graduated from the police academy two days prior, was unsure about what to do after⁢ the​ girls were made‍ to lie on the ‍ground. She asked other officers‌ who arrived later if‌ she should handcuff all of them. Another officer advised her to handcuff some of them.\n\nSoon after, another officer seen in the footage decided it was time​ to de-escalate the situation. He ​reassured one of the handcuffed girls, “You’re going ‌to be with ‌your momma. You’re going to be okay. All right? All right? We’ll get you out in a second, sweetheart. It’s for our safety.” The⁣ body⁤ camera footage then shows Gilliam being led to a patrol car, her hands cuffed ‍behind her back.\n\nThe police soon realized their mistake amidst the shouting and crying. While the department’s system had notified them​ that Gilliam’s⁢ Dodge with Colorado license plates was stolen, the actual stolen vehicle was a motorcycle with the same license plate​ number in Montana.\n\nOfficers kept⁤ their guns drawn for about three-and-a-half minutes, and they ⁣removed the girls’⁤ handcuffs after about eight-and-a-half minutes, once they realized the car wasn’t stolen, according to ​prosecutors.\n\nFor the first ⁢year after the incident, ⁤Gilliam was filled with rage, angry that she couldn’t ⁤do anything to help the girls.\n\n“Mentally, it destroyed me because I felt⁢ like not only‌ am ⁣I not safe, these kids aren’t safe,”⁢ she said in⁣ an interview before ⁢the settlement​ was announced, recalling how⁢ it felt to be held​ on the ground in handcuffs.\n\nHer daughter, who was ​previously a “joyous” child, began acting out and became withdrawn.

It appears that the average American is consuming more protein than necessary, while their fiber ⁢intake is falling ⁤short. This imbalance⁣ in diet could potentially lead⁣ to serious health‌ issues.\n\nAs⁣ reported by Vox, ⁢Americans seem ​to have developed an “unusual fixation ​with protein,”​ consuming⁤ double the recommended dietary allowance. Astonishingly, “60% of U.S. ​adults are striving to incorporate even more protein into their ⁤diets.” This protein obsession could potentially heighten the risk of diseases such as cancer ⁢and heart disease.\n\nGoodRX Health highlights the importance of ⁢protein in our diets, stating, “Protein deficiency can ​pose a serious health risk‍ and is a common cause of malnutrition in other parts of the world. ‌As a ⁤macronutrient, protein is essential in large quantities for proper growth, development, and overall health.”\n\nHowever, the article also ⁣warns about ‌the dangers ⁢of overconsumption. “An excess of​ protein in your diet can disrupt your macronutrient balance. Consuming high amounts of protein usually involves eating a lot of meat and dairy⁢ products, which are often high in⁤ saturated⁢ fat and low in fiber.”\n\nThe ⁢consequences of this can⁣ be​ an increase in bad cholesterol, leading to a higher risk of‍ heart disease and‌ cancer. On the flip side, “plant-based proteins (e.g., beans, grains, soy, nuts, and seeds) are lower in saturated fat, high in fiber, ⁤and rich in micronutrients like vitamin K⁣ and potassium (which Americans tend to lack),” according⁤ to the article.\n\nThe federal government’s Dietary Guidelines‌ for Americans, 2020-2025, suggest healthy protein foods ​include “lean meats, poultry ⁢and eggs; seafood,⁣ beans, peas, and lentils; and nuts, seeds, and soy products.”\n\nThe New York Times ​in 2016 explained, “People ⁤need sufficient protein in the diet because it‌ supplies indispensable amino acids that⁢ our bodies cannot synthesize on their own. These amino acids are the essential building blocks used to make and maintain muscle, bone, skin, and other tissues, as well as a variety of ⁣vital hormones and⁤ enzymes.”\n\nHowever,⁢ the Times article also points out that Americans are likely​ consuming too much protein. It’s relatively‌ easy to meet the​ recommended daily protein intake — 56 grams⁢ for⁤ men and 46 grams for‍ women — without resorting to​ protein⁢ drinks or powders, which many people⁤ do. The Times noted that a cup of chopped chicken ​has about 44 grams of protein, while a cup of tofu ​or a serving of Greek yogurt has 20 grams. Three ​eggs provide 18 grams.\n\nAdding a protein bar ​or shake ⁣to this ‍can easily lead to overconsumption unless you’re mindful of your intake.\n\nThe Dangers of Protein Overconsumption\n\nAbout a decade ago,‍ the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that men consume nearly twice the amount of protein they need, ‍averaging⁤ about 100 grams⁢ per ⁤day. The revised Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggested that⁢ men and teenage boys, in particular, should “reduce ⁢overall intake of protein foods” and⁢ eat more vegetables. While ⁢teenage​ girls and older adults may not get enough protein, most American adults are getting too much.\n\nThe Times‌ article raised concerns that protein-rich foods don’t preserve muscle mass ⁢over time and a high-protein diet ​can lead⁤ to ​kidney disease for some. Some studies ⁣have suggested that too much protein can increase the risk of ⁣heart disease, cancer, and other⁤ problems.\n\n“One study led by Valter Longo, the director of the⁣ Longevity Institute​ at the University of Southern California⁤ in Los Angeles, followed‍ a nationally representative⁤ sample of 6,381 adults. It found that ​those who ate ⁣a high-protein diet between the ages of ⁣50 and 65 were four times more likely to die of ​cancer than those who consumed less protein,” according to the Times.\n\nHowever, ‍others argue that there’s not enough⁤ evidence to​ support this claim.\n\nScientific American highlighted⁢ another issue with excessive protein consumption in 2022. It reported that “protein-packed diets add ⁣excess nitrogen to the environment through ‍urine, rivaling pollution from agricultural⁤ fertilizers.”\n\nEven if it’s not harmful to human health, the article stated, ⁢”This excess does pose a problem for the country’s⁢ waterways. The nation’s wastewater​ is laden ⁣with the leftovers from protein digestion: nitrogen compounds that can feed toxic‌ algal blooms and pollute the‌ air and drinking water. This source of nitrogen pollution even rivals that ‌from fertilizers washed off of ‍fields​ growing food crops, new research ⁢suggests.”\n\nThe Importance of Fiber\n\nEating Well emphasizes that‍ fiber, although not a popular food topic, is crucial to our‌ health. Fiber is found​ in fruits,⁤ vegetables, ⁤whole grains, beans, legumes, nuts, and seeds, in ⁤two forms — soluble and insoluble. Both are⁢ vital to our ⁢health.\n\nThe article stated ‍that those who consume a lot of fiber have a lower risk of heart disease, cancer, Type 2 diabetes, ⁣and obesity. However, only 5% of Americans meet the recommendations‌ for fiber intake.\n\nInadequate fiber intake can ⁤lead to chronic inflammation, which is‌ linked to the aforementioned health issues. It can weaken the ⁤immune system, make weight management more difficult, and lead to ⁢constipation​ or diarrhea, hemorrhoids, an increased risk of colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease,‌ and other ailments.\n\nOne way to balance both​ protein and fiber intake is to opt for plant-based​ proteins more often and reduce consumption of⁤ meat⁣ and dairy.\n\nHealth.com listed the following ⁣as symptoms ⁣of protein deficiency:\n\nSwelling;\nChanges to​ hair and skin, including ⁤hair loss and graying or dry, thin, or peeling skin;\nFrequent illness;\nMuscle loss and weakness;\nDecreased bone density;\nStunted growth;\nWeight loss or gain;\nAnemia;\nAnother Dietary Concern\n\nProtein and fiber aren’t the only dietary concerns‍ for Americans.\n\nHarvard researchers⁤ recently highlighted that Americans are also harming their health ⁢due to the consumption of ultra-processed foods. According to a recent post on Scienceblog.com, these foods make‍ up the “bulk of the American diet” — and largely explain the obesity epidemic in America, ⁣with more than⁢ 40% of ⁣the ⁣population being obese,‍ as per the Centers ​for​ Disease ⁢Control and Prevention.\n\nIn‍ the Harvard research, participants were randomly assigned to an ultra-processed or unprocessed diet for two weeks. Despite the two groups being matched for⁤ nutrients, the ultra-processed group consumed about 500 calories ⁣more per day than the other⁤ group, leading⁣ to weight and ‌body fat gain. Those who consumed minimally processed foods “spontaneously lost weight and lost​ body fat.”","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/02/05/americans-are-consuming-excessive-protein-and-not-enough-fiber/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"American Workers Struggle for the Passage of the Retirement Savings for Americans Act","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3355-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"From the heart of SALT LAKE CITY — The dream of⁣ retiring comfortably is ​becoming increasingly elusive⁤ for many Americans. The ⁣estimated‍ savings required for a comfortable retirement continues to climb each year,⁤ with the latest figure pegged⁤ at ‌a staggering $1.8 million, as per a survey conducted by Charles Schwab.\n\nAccording to the survey, “While the required amount hasn’t seen a drastic ​increase, only 37% of workers are confident that they’ll be able to meet this target,​ a decrease of 10% from last​ year when the ‌figure was‍ $1.7 million.”\n\nThe retirement system in the U.S. heavily relies on individual ​responsibility for retirement savings. The sufficiency of retirement income is largely dependent on personal savings⁤ habits, investment decisions, and the availability of retirement plans through⁢ employment.\n\nRecent data from the Economic ⁤Innovation Group revealed that in 2021, ⁤”A staggering 69 million —⁢ or 55.5% — of workers did⁤ not have any form of employer-provided ​retirement plan, a‍ group that is predominantly composed of low-income⁢ earners.”\n\nThe data also ‌highlighted​ the disparity ‌among‌ states in terms of access to employer-provided retirement plans.\n\nIdaho emerged as the top‌ state, with 47% of its low-income workforce having access⁣ to an employer-provided retirement plan. In contrast, Florida lagged behind with only 23% of its low-income workforce having access to ⁤such plans.\n\nIn Utah, 30% of low-income‌ workers had access to an employer-provided retirement plan, but only 16% participated, leaving 260,134 low-income workers ⁤without any access.\n\nSen.⁤ Thom Tillis, R-N.C., stated ⁢in a press release, “Approximately 40 million ⁤Americans do not have ‍access to an ‌employer-sponsored​ retirement plan,⁤ posing a‍ significant hurdle to​ achieving⁢ financial‍ security for their retirement.”\n\nSenators Tillis and John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., ​along with Reps, Lloyd Smucker, R-Pa., and ⁤Terri Sewell,⁤ D-Ala., reintroduced⁤ the Retirement Savings​ for ‌Americans Act to Congress last ​year after its ⁤initial introduction to the Senate in 2022.\n\nUnderstanding the RSAA\n\nThe‍ Retirement Savings for Americans Act is a bipartisan bill aimed⁢ at enhancing⁢ retirement security and financial well-being ⁤for low- and middle-income American workers.\n\nThe act includes ⁣several key‍ provisions:\n\nEligibility and auto enrollment: ⁣The act targets full- and part-time⁤ workers who do not ⁢have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. These⁤ workers would be ⁣eligible for an account and automatically ⁢enrolled, with contributions‌ set at 3% of their income. They have the option to adjust this contribution rate or opt out entirely. Independent workers,‌ such as gig workers, are also included in this eligibility.\nFederal contribution: To support low- ⁢and moderate-income workers, the act proposes ⁣a ⁣1% automatic contribution ⁤and up‌ to a 4% matching contribution via ⁢a refundable federal tax ⁢credit. ‌This benefit starts to decrease at median income levels.\nPortability: One ⁢of the key benefits⁢ of the program is the portability‍ of the accounts. They remain with ​the workers throughout their careers, allowing them to stop and start contributions as needed.\nPrivate assets: The accounts are the property of the worker, and the assets​ can be passed down to future generations, aiding in wealth and financial security⁣ building.\nInvestment options: The ⁣act provides a range of investment options similar to those ​in the current Thrift ⁤Savings Plan. These include low-fee‍ investment choices like lifecycle funds, which are aligned with the worker’s estimated retirement‍ date, and index funds composed of stocks ‍and‌ bonds.\n\n“Americans who work hard their entire lives ‌deserve‌ to retire with dignity,” Hickenlooper said, as quoted by 401K Specialist. “This bill helps low-income ⁢workers enjoy a secure retirement and fulfill their American dream.”\n\nRSAA ‍Gains Widespread Support\n\nThe act ⁢has received endorsements from various ‍sectors‌ and organizations, reflecting a bipartisan interest in improving the⁤ U.S. retirement savings⁣ system.\n\nIn October, ⁢Charles Schwab, ⁣the American multinational financial services company, expressed its strong support for the act.\n\n“Creating‍ this⁢ kind of program meets an‍ obligation we all share to help every working American build financial security and ​well-being in retirement. I also know it will offset future support ‌we surely would have to ⁢provide if we don’t help more people begin to build that⁢ security today,” founder ‌and co-chairman Charles⁣ Schwab said ⁢in his support letter.\n\n“And in ⁤true American spirit, ⁤it⁢ isn’t a giveaway, ‌but an⁤ incentive for working ‍individuals‍ to begin helping themselves and their families,” he added.\n\nThe American Association of Retired Persons, a prominent nonprofit and nonpartisan organization, is the latest to fully endorse⁢ the Retirement Savings for ‍Americans Act.\n\n“Nearly ‌1 out ⁢of​ 4 ⁢Americans ⁣has no retirement savings, and more than half of all Americans report they are concerned they will not‌ achieve financial security in retirement. We​ know that Americans are much more likely⁤ to save when ⁣they have access to retirement savings options at work.

This ⁣triumph echoes his ‌success in the same state four years ago, which‍ served as a springboard‍ for his journey⁣ to the Oval ⁢Office.\n\nOn this victorious ​Saturday, ‌Biden ‌outshone other Democratic contenders on the South Carolina ballot, including ⁢Minnesota’s⁣ Representative Dean Phillips⁣ and renowned author Marianne Williamson.\n\nThe⁣ president’s campaign team had put in a significant amount of effort to boost voter turnout‌ for Biden. Their ‌strategy was to ⁤test ⁣the waters for mobilizing Black voters, a crucial demographic⁤ in South Carolina’s‌ Democratic ‍vote and⁢ a cornerstone of Biden’s‌ blueprint for​ victory in the upcoming November elections.\n\nThe choice of South Carolina as the kickoff for the party’s 2024 primary calendar was a strategic one, endorsed by Biden and​ other party leaders. They ​highlighted ​the state’s racially diverse population, a stark contrast to the predominantly white demographics ⁤of traditional early-voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nDespite the Democratic National Committee’s stance, New Hampshire went ahead ‍with a leadoff⁢ primary last ⁤month. However, ⁢without the backing​ of the president or the national ‍party, and with no official delegates at ⁢stake, the contest​ was nonbinding. Nevertheless,‌ Biden emerged victorious in New ⁣Hampshire, ⁤thanks to a successful write-in campaign by his supporters.\n\nSouth​ Carolina,​ a state where Biden has nurtured deep relationships with supporters and donors over the years, played a crucial role in his 2020 campaign. A significant victory ⁢here breathed ⁤new⁤ life into his campaign in other early-voting ⁣states,⁢ catapulting him towards‍ the nomination.\n\nRep. Jim ⁢Clyburn has been instrumental in Biden’s⁤ South ‌Carolina campaign. Clyburn’s endorsement in 2020 served as a beacon for the state’s Black voters, signaling that Biden was the candidate ⁤who would champion ‍their interests.\n\nBoth Biden‌ and Vice⁣ President Kamala Harris, the first Black woman and Asian American to serve in this role, have consistently expressed their gratitude to the state’s Democrats for their unwavering support. At ‍a‌ state party fundraiser a week⁤ ago, Biden acknowledged the role of the state’s Democrats in his presidency, stating, “you’re​ the reason I am president.” He also rallied the party faithful, declaring that they were “the reason Donald Trump​ is a loser. ⁣And ⁤you’re the ⁣reason we’re going to win ⁣and beat him again,” thereby⁣ setting the stage for a likely general election face-off‍ with the GOP’s current front-runner.\n\nThe Biden reelection campaign has used ‍the state’s primary to fine-tune strategies and messages that resonate with Black voters and motivate‌ them⁢ to vote in​ the November general election. Despite⁣ South‍ Carolina’s strong Republican leanings,‍ its diverse primary voters reflect the Democratic coalition that Biden needs to secure ‌for another term​ in‍ office.\n\nWith South Carolina’s primary concluded, the Democratic nominating calendar now moves to Nevada, which holds its primary on ‍Tuesday, followed by Michigan on Feb. 27.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/02/04/joe-biden-triumphs-in-south-carolina-democratic-primary-prepares-for-reelection-campaign/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"US and UK Launch Counterattacks on Yemen’s Iran-Supported Houthis in Fresh Offensive","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3340-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"WASHINGTON ⁣— In a second wave of attacks aimed at crippling ‍Iran-backed ​groups, the United ⁤States and Britain targeted 36 Houthi locations in Yemen on Saturday.⁢ These groups have been persistently launching attacks on American and international interests following ⁢the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nThe most‌ recent offensive against⁤ the Houthis was ⁢carried out by warships and fighter jets. This follows an⁤ air assault in Iraq and Syria on Friday,​ which ⁣targeted other Iranian-backed militias and the Iranian Revolutionary ⁤Guard in response to a drone strike that resulted in‌ the death of three U.S. troops in Jordan the previous weekend.\n\nThe Houthi ⁤targets, spread across 13 different locations, were hit by U.S. F/A-18 fighter jets from ⁤the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier and by the USS Gravely and the USS Carney ‌Navy destroyers, which⁢ launched Tomahawk missiles from the Red Sea. This information was provided⁤ by U.S.​ officials⁣ to the Associated Press under the condition ‍of ​anonymity,⁤ as they were not ⁤authorized to publicly discuss the military operation.\n\nThe ⁣U.S. made it clear that its response to the soldiers’​ deaths at the⁤ Tower 22 base in Jordan last Sunday would not be ‍confined to a single night, ‌target, or ‍group. However, the‌ Houthis have been launching almost daily missile or drone attacks against commercial and military‌ ships in⁣ the⁢ Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, and ⁢they have shown no signs of reducing their campaign. The impact of the allied assaults on their activities remains uncertain.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin stated that the military action, supported by Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, the ⁣Netherlands, and New Zealand, “sends a clear message to the Houthis that they will continue to face further⁣ consequences if they do not cease their ⁢illegal ⁣attacks on international shipping and naval vessels.”\n\nHe further added, “We will not hesitate to defend⁢ lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world’s most critical waterways.”\n\nThe Defense Department revealed that the strikes targeted sites associated ⁤with the Houthis’ deeply buried weapons storage facilities, ​missile systems and launchers, ‍air defense systems, and radars.\n\nSaturday’s strikes marked the third time the U.S. ⁢and Britain had conducted a large‍ joint operation to strike‌ Houthi weapon launchers, radar sites, and drones. The strikes in Yemen are intended to emphasize the broader ​message to Iran that ⁤Washington holds Tehran accountable for arming, funding, and⁤ training the array of militias behind attacks across the Mideast against U.S. and⁤ international interests over the past‌ several months, ​including‍ in Iraq and Syria by the rebels in Yemen.\n\nVideo footage shared online by residents of Sanaa, Yemen’s capital, included the sound of explosions and at least one blast​ lighting up the night sky. The blasts were reported to ⁤have occurred around buildings associated ⁤with the Yemeni presidential compound. The Houthi-controlled state-run news agency, SABA, reported strikes in al-Bayda, Dhamar, Hajjah, Hodeida, Taiz, and Sanaa provinces.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. destroyer Laboon and F/A-18s from the Eisenhower shot down​ seven drones fired from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen into the⁣ Red Sea. The ⁣destroyer Carney shot down a drone fired in the Gulf of Aden, and U.S. forces took out four more ​drones that were prepared to ⁣launch.\n\nHours before the latest joint operation, the U.S. conducted another self-defense strike on a site in Yemen, destroying six anti-ship cruise⁤ missiles, as it has done repeatedly when ⁤it has ⁣detected a missile or drone ready‍ to launch.\n\nThe Houthi attacks have forced shipping companies to reroute their vessels ‍from⁤ the Red Sea, sending them around Africa through the Cape‌ of Good⁣ Hope ⁢— a much⁤ longer, costlier, and less efficient passage. The threats have also ‌led the U.S. and its allies to establish a joint mission⁢ where warships from⁢ participating ⁤nations provide a protective umbrella of air defense for ships as they travel⁣ the critical waterway that ‌runs from the Suez Canal down ⁢to the Bab el-Mandeb Strait.\n\nDuring normal operations, about 400 commercial vessels‍ transit the southern Red Sea at any given time.\n\nThe U.S. has attributed the Jordan attack to the Islamic Resistance ⁣in Iraq, a coalition ⁢of Iranian-backed militias.​ Iran has attempted to distance itself from the drone strike, claiming⁢ that the militias act independently of its direction.\n\nHussein al-Mosawi, spokesperson for Harakat al-Nujaba, one of the main Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, condemned the earlier U.S. strike in ⁣Iraq and warned Washington that “every action elicits a reaction.” However, in an AP interview in ‍Baghdad, he also struck a⁤ more conciliatory tone, stating, ​”We do not ⁤wish to escalate or widen regional tensions.”\n\nMosawi revealed that⁤ the ⁣targeted sites in Iraq were mainly‍ “devoid ​of fighters and military personnel at the time of the attack.”\n\nRami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported that 23 people, all rank-and-file fighters, were‌ killed. ⁢Iraqi government spokesperson Bassim al-Awadi stated that 16 people, including civilians, were killed and there was “significant damage” to homes and private properties.\n\nThe U.S. confirmed that it had informed ‍Iraq about the operation before it commenced.\n\nA U.S. official revealed ​that an initial battle ‌damage assessment showed the U.S.​ had struck ​each of its planned targets in addition‍ to a few ⁢”dynamic targets” that​ emerged as the mission unfolded, including a surface-to-air missile site‌ and drone ‍launch sites. The official, ⁢who‍ spoke on the condition of ⁢anonymity to provide details that were not ⁣yet⁤ public,⁣ did not have a casualty assessment.\n\nThe Iraqi government has been ⁣in a delicate position ‍since⁢ a group of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias calling itself Islamic Resistance⁢ in Iraq began launching attacks on U.S. bases ⁣in Iraq and Syria on Oct. 18. The group described the strikes as retaliation⁣ for Washington’s support‍ for Israel in ​the war in Gaza.\n\nBehind the scenes,​ Iraqi officials have attempted to rein ⁤in the ​militias, while also condemning U.S. retaliatory strikes as a violation of Iraqi sovereignty and calling for an exit of the⁣ 2,500 U.S. troops who are in the country as part‌ of ⁢an international coalition to fight IS.

Tony Romeo, the founder of ​a new sea exploration company‌ based in South Carolina, believes that his ⁢team has captured a sonar image of the legendary American pilot’s Lockheed 10-E Electra.\n\nArchaeologists and explorers are filled with‌ anticipation. However, whether the plane of the iconic pilot rests at the‌ estimated‌ 16,000-foot depth is yet to be confirmed. There are ongoing debates about the appropriate treatment⁣ of any object that is discovered.\n\nArchivists are optimistic that Romeo’s Deep Sea Vision is on the brink of solving this enigma, not just to solve the mystery, but to bring back the focus on Earhart’s achievements. The hunt ‍is on for the first ⁢woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nRomeo, who comes from an “aviation family” and holds a private pilot’s license himself, ​was seeking an⁣ adventure beyond his⁤ commercial real estate career. He has always ⁤been intrigued by the Earhart‍ mystery.\n\nHe‌ sold his real estate⁣ interests to finance last year’s search and purchase a $9 million underwater drone from a Norwegian company. The ‌cutting-edge technology, known as the Hugin 6000,⁢ can reach ​the deepest layer of⁢ the ocean at 19,700 feet.\n\nIn September ‌2023, a ⁢16-person‍ crew embarked on a​ roughly 100-day search, scanning over 5,200 square miles of seafloor around Howland Island, a mid-Pacific⁤ atoll‍ between Papua New Guinea and Hawaii.\n\nIt‍ was only in December, upon reviewing the sonar data, that they spotted a fuzzy yellow outline resembling a plane. “We believe very strongly that we ⁣have an image of‍ Amelia’s ‌aircraft,” Romeo ⁤told the Associated Press.\n\nThe next step is to ⁣send a‍ camera underwater ⁢for a closer look at the unidentified object. If the visuals confirm their hopes, Romeo said the aim would be to recover the long-lost Electra.\n\nRomeo’s team ​embarked on this ⁣costly adventure ⁢to “solve aviation’s greatest⁢ unsolved mystery.” He believes that⁢ an open hatch⁣ could suggest that Earhart and her flight companion escaped after the initial impact, and a cockpit dial could provide clues about‌ what went wrong.\n\nEarhart and her navigator,​ Fred Noonan, vanished while flying from New Guinea to Howland Island during her attempt ⁤to become the first ⁢female pilot to circumnavigate the globe. She⁤ had radioed that she was running low on fuel.\n\nThe Navy searched but found no trace. The ‍U.S. government’s‍ official position has been that Earhart and Noonan went down with their plane.\n\nSince then, theories have ranged from the absurd, such as alien ⁢abduction or⁤ Earhart living in New Jersey under an alias, to speculation that she and Noonan were⁤ executed by the Japanese or died ‍as castaways on an island.\n\n“Amelia is America’s favorite missing person,” ⁢Romeo said.\n\nDeep ⁣Sea⁣ Vision’s expedition is ‌not the⁤ first. David Jourdan’s‌ exploration company Nauticos conducted three unsuccessful expeditions between 2002 and 2017, surveying an area of seafloor about‌ the size of Connecticut. These efforts were preceded by a $1 million​ hunt in 1999 from Nevada-based Dana Timmer. As recently as 2014, Timmer had not given up and sought to raise nearly $2‌ million for another attempt.\n\nBetween 1988 and⁤ 2002, the International Group for Historic Aircraft‌ Recovery made six trips to a different island in the western‌ Pacific Ocean under the impression that ‌Earhart‌ crash-landed on a flat reef 1,800 ‌miles south of Hawaii.\n\nHillary Clinton, then the U.S. Secretary ⁤of State, encouraged the ⁣group ​in 2012 when it launched a new search ‌for the wreckage fueled by analysis of a 1937 photo⁣ believed to show the Lockheed Electra’s ‌landing⁢ gear jutting out of⁣ the island’s shoreline.\n\nMaritime archaeologist James Delgado ⁤said Romeo’s potential ​find would change the narrative, but “we need to see more.”\n\n“Let’s drop‌ some cameras down ‍there and ‌take a‍ look,” said ​Delgado, senior vice president of ⁣the archaeological‍ firm SEARCH Inc.\n\nDelgado said Romeo’s expedition employed world-class, cutting-edge technology that was once classified and is “revolutionizing our understanding⁤ of the deep ocean.”\n\nBut he said Romeo’s team must ‍provide “a forensic level of documentation” to prove it’s Earhart’s Lockheed. That could mean the patterns⁢ in the fuselage’s aluminum, the‍ configuration of its tail and details from the cockpit.\n\nJourdan, of Nauticos, would have expected to see straight wings and not swept wings, like the new‌ sonar suggests, as‍ well as engines. But⁣ that could ⁣be explained by⁤ damage to the aircraft or reflections ⁢distorting the image, he acknowledged.\n\n“It could be a plane. It certainly looks like a plane. It could be a geological feature that looks like a plane,” he said.\n\nDorothy Cochrane, an aeronautics curator at‍ the National Air and‌ Space Museum, said Romeo’s crew searched in‌ the right place near Howland Island. That’s where Earhart desperately sought a runway when she disappeared on the last leg ‌of her flight.\n\nIf the object really is the historic aircraft, the question for Cochrane will be whether⁣ it is safe to raise. How ⁤much of the machinery is still intact would be determined in⁤ part by how⁤ smoothly​ Earhart landed, she added.\n\n“That’s ‍where you ‌have to really look at this image and‍ say, ‘What have‍ we ‍got here?'” said Cochrane.\n\nIf the fuzzy sonar images turn⁣ out to be the plane, ‍international standards for underwater archaeology would strongly suggest the aircraft remain where it is, said ​Ole Varmer, a retired attorney ‌with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a ​senior fellow at The​ Ocean Foundation.\n\nNonintrusive research can still be conducted to reveal ​why the⁢ plane possibly ‍crashed, Varmer said.\n\n“You preserve as much of the story as you can,” Varmer ⁤said. “It’s not just ⁤the wreck. It’s where it ​is and its ‌context on the ⁣seabed. That is part of the story as to how and ⁤why it⁢ got there. When you‍ salvage it, you’re⁢ destroying part of the site, which can provide information.”\n\nRaising the plane and placing it​ in a museum would likely cost ⁤hundreds of‍ millions of dollars, Varmer said. And while Romeo could conceivably make a salvage ‌claim in the courts, the plane’s owner has the​ right to ⁣deny it.\n\nEarhart bought the Lockheed with money raised, at least in part, by the Purdue Research Foundation, according to a blog post by‍ Purdue University in‍ Indiana. And she planned to return the aircraft to the school.\n\nRomeo ‍said the team believes the​ plane belongs ⁣in the⁣ Smithsonian. Acknowledging the “uncharted territory” of potential legal issues, he said his ⁢exploration company will “deal with those as they come up.”","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/02/03/blurry-sonar-picture-sparks-renewed-interest-and-doubt-about-earharts-last-journey/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"MrBeast collaborates with JustServe, urging users to join the app","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3313-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"From the heart of SALT⁤ LAKE CITY, a thrilling announcement has been made.

He was 3 when his father, prominent Newark physician Dr. ⁤Earl Leroy Wood, brought a large oil painting home ​during ‍the Great Depression, according to the FBI.‌ Overlooking their dining room table, the canvas showed a poor woman teaching a group​ of children to read.‌ It’s a scene of simple beauty, showing the honest dignity of‍ a peasant world.\n\nThe artist, John Opie, ⁣painted “The Schoolmistress” ⁣in 1784, and ⁣experts at the Tate ‌Britain Art​ Gallery, where ⁢a collection of Opie’s works are held, said he modeled the scene‌ off his own childhood, and the central figure off his mother.\n\nThe original bill of sale from John Mitchell ⁢& Sons Fine Paintings‌ in London shows ‌that Earl Wood purchased the painting in 1930⁤ for $7,500 (around $130,000 in today’s money). It remained in Francis Wood’s thoughts as he grew up and moved away, and he continued to think about⁤ that striking image. His ‍son, Tom Wood, told KSL.com he purchased a smaller painting by Opie, “Two Little Girls,” to remind him of his childhood home and the feeling of that piece.\n\nWhen ⁤Francis Wood married and had children,‍ the painting hung over their⁢ weekly Sunday meals at his father, Earl​ Wood’s, house. Then, in 1969, his parents’ house was broken⁣ into while they were abroad in Europe, and the beloved painting disappeared for the next 50 years.\n\nOn July 7, 1969, three men with mob connections, according to the FBI, tried to break into Earl Wood’s⁢ house to steal a valuable coin collection. Gerald Festa, Gerald⁣ Donnerstand, and Austin Costiglione fled when the ⁤burglar alarm went off, but hid nearby to watch as the ⁢police responded, according to a report in the New York Daily News.\n\nAccording to the later testimony⁣ of Festa, state Sen. Anthony Imperiale, also allegedly connected to the local mafia, arrived at ‍the house‍ in a “big black Cadillac” at the same time ‍as police. Imperiale was ⁢a supposed friend⁣ of the Woods family, and heard about the incident on‍ a police radio he kept ‌in the ‌car.\n\nWhile inside, a caretaker​ allegedly pointed out the painting to Imperiale, claiming that it was⁣ priceless, the Daily News article said.\n\nAccording to Festa, Imperiale summoned​ the three accused thieves to his club, and told where the Opie painting was‌ and its significant value. On July 25, 1969, “The Schoolmistress” was stolen from the Wood family home.\n\nFesta admitted to the crime in a later trial, and was ⁢found guilty along with his other two accomplices. He implicated Imperiale, who was never charged, and by that time the painting had vanished, according ⁤to the FBI.\n\nTom Wood was 14 when the painting was stolen and remembers the impact that theft made. “My⁣ father didn’t⁢ ever think he would see it again,” he said.\n\nIn 2021, Francis Wood received⁤ a call from the Newark Museum. It was investigating⁤ a painting, believed to be the missing Opie, that had turned up during the ⁢liquidation of an estate in Utah in St. ​George.\n\nHe remained skeptical and waited for news. Six months later, Tom Wood remembers riding ‍in a car when his‍ father got a call. “This⁣ is the ⁢FBI?” Frances Wood said into the phone, pulling over. Tom Wood remembered saying, “Dad, hang ⁤up, that’s a scam call!” It was actually FBI special agent Gary France.\n\nFrance found that the painting had been in the Hallandale, Florida, residence of Joseph Covello Sr., a reputed lieutenant of the Gambino crime family, according to the FBI. The house, along with the painting, was sold in the late ’80s when Covello faced federal charges for organized crime.\n\nIn​ June 2021, a Utah accounting firm in Washington County was liquidating the assets of the man who purchased that property from the Covellos, and had passed away the year previous. ⁢Kris Braunberger, partner at the Hinton Burdick accounting firm, asked an appraiser to examine the work. He was surprised ⁣by Dodworth and Stauffer’s report: “Very good condition for age and type, minor scattered losses in lower left corner ‌… the painting was never recovered by law enforcement.”\n\nAaron Smith and his team of art appraisers⁢ were able to identify the painting because Vivian ‌John ⁢Hendra, ​an Opie scholar in the U.K., had​ saved a​ notice from the Newark ‍Museum‌ that offered a reward for the missing artwork, an appraiser ⁤said. That link allowed ⁣the art to be verified as the authentic missing piece. ​Hendra passed away‍ in​ 2021, with the knowledge that​ the ⁢piece had been found.\n\nOn Jan. 11, 2024, France presented​ the ​painting to Francis Wood. His‍ son, when asked what’s​ next for the artwork, said, “My father wants to be able to look at it. For the near future, that’s the goal.”\n\nIt is currently being cleaned and appraised. Long term, Tom Wood said, they will be interested to find a⁣ home⁢ for the painting at a museum, possibly in London at the Tate Britain Art Gallery, where a sister painting to ⁢”The Schoolmistress” is kept.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/01/27/st-george-recovers-rare-painting-stolen-by-the-mob-50-years-ago/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Uncertainty looms over death row executions as lethal injection drugs dwindle","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3135-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"SALT LAKE ⁢CITY — Alabama executed an inmate Thursday using nitrogen ‍gas.\n\nThe inmate, Kenneth Eugene Smith, ⁤was‍ convicted of murdering ⁤Elizabeth Sennett for ​$1,000. The jury recommended a sentence of ⁤life without the possibility⁤ of parole. ⁣The judge overrode the recommendation and⁢ sentenced Smith to death, ⁤according to court documents.\n\nThe state ‌of Alabama attempted to execute Smith via lethal​ injection on Nov. 17, 2022, but officials called off the⁣ execution after they could not find a suitable⁣ vein ‍to administer the drugs.\n\nAs for the execution scheduled for Thursday, Smith filed ​a motion for⁢ a preliminary injunction claiming that this scheduled execution via nitrogen hypoxia would violate the First, Eighth⁢ and 14th amendments of the U.S. ‌Constitution along ‌with ‍the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized⁤ Persons Act and ⁤the Alabama Constitution’s ‌Religious Freedom Amendment.\n\nLast week ‍in U.S. District‌ Court for the Middle District of Alabama‍ Northern ⁢Division, District Judge ⁣R. Austin Huffaker Jr. ruled the execution ‌would⁣ go forward. The Supreme Court declined to​ stop the execution on ⁣Wednesday.\n\nNitrogen hypoxia has⁢ never been used in a U.S. execution, the New York Times reported.\n\n“Under this‌ method, which has been used in assisted suicides in Europe, Mr. Smith will be fitted with a mask and administered a‌ flow of nitrogen gas, effectively depriving him of oxygen until he dies,” Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs ⁣wrote for the Times.\n\nThe use of nitrogen gas marks a departure‌ from‌ lethal ‍injection, ⁣which⁣ is typically used in U.S. executions. States across the country using ‌lethal injection ​”have encountered various problems with the execution method, including difficulty finding usable veins, needles becoming disengaged or problems‍ (sourcing) or using the lethal​ chemicals,” the Associated Press⁢ reported.\n\nStates’ difficulty with finding lethal injection drugs have impacted legislation and ‍practice​ of capital punishment.\n\nIdaho⁤ passed HB186⁤ in March of last ‌year, which said if the director ​of the Idaho Department of Correction determines that lethal injection is not ⁤available in the state, then⁣ the state can use firing squad as‍ its ⁣method of execution. Other states that‌ allow for the use of ⁣the firing squad include⁢ Mississippi, Oklahoma, Utah and South Carolina. If an inmate in Utah was convicted before 2004, the inmate could choose to die by ‍lethal injection or firing squad, while lethal injection is ⁤set to be used ‍for inmates convicted since then.\n\nWhen Idaho Gov. Brad Little ‌signed⁣ the bill establishing the firing squad as a potential execution method, he sent a letter to‍ House Speaker Mike Moyle, stating, “I have not given up on the state’s ability to ⁤acquire the chemicals.”\n\n‘A critical drug’\n\nIdaho had scheduled the ⁣execution of Gerald Pizzuto for Dec. 15, 2022. The execution was delayed after the state​ could not source the necessary ⁤chemicals.\n\n“While our efforts to secure chemicals‍ remain ongoing, I have no reason to believe our status will change prior ⁤to the​ scheduled execution on Dec. 15, 2022,”⁢ Josh Tewalt, Idaho Department of Correction director, wrote in a letter obtained by the ⁤Idaho⁢ Statesman. “In my ‌professional⁤ judgment, I believe‍ it is in ⁢the best interest of justice to allow​ the death warrant to expire and‌ stand down our execution preparation.”\n\nIdaho isn’t alone in having difficulties obtaining lethal ‌injection drugs.\n\nDeborah Denno, a Fordham University law professor, said the nation has dealt with ‍a ‍lethal⁤ injection drug shortage since around 2010.\n\n“The first drug, which was the source of this shortage, is‌ called sodium thiopental,” Denno said in a phone ⁢interview. “And it’s a critical drug, all‍ of the three are, but⁢ the first⁣ drug⁣ is particularly critical because ⁢it renders the inmate‌ unconscious.”\n\n‘Executing​ states must now go underground’\n\nSodium thiopental was ⁤recommended ‌for lethal ‍injections. One manufacturer primarily ⁤made the drug and eventually stopped manufacturing it, Denno said. “When that manufacturer was ‍no longer making it and ⁣they really no longer had access to the chemicals to make it, it really threw a wrench into the lethal injection process that no one had ever predicted.”\n\nWhen Hospira⁤ stopped producing the drug, the American Society ⁢of Anesthesiologists issued​ a letter saying⁢ the society⁢ was “extremely troubled” ​that the drug was taken off the market. “The ASA ‌certainly does not condone the use‌ of sodium thiopental for capital punishment,‌ but we also do‌ not condone‌ using the ⁤issue as the basis to place undue burdens on the distribution of this critical drug to the United States,” the letter stated.\n\nTurning⁣ to different countries and compounding pharmacies, Denno said states tried​ to obtain the drug⁤ or ​they would use‌ an alternative ​drug.⁢ Pentobarbital and midazolam are alternative‍ drugs used.\n\nIn addition to the drug ⁤shortage as related ‍to sodium thiopental, another issue arose — in 2016, Pfizer blocked ⁤the sale of its products for executions.\n\n“With Pfizer’s announcement, all FDA-approved manufacturers of ⁢any ⁢potential execution drug have‍ now blocked their sale for this purpose,” Maya Foa, who tracks​ drug companies for Reprieve, ‍told the New York Times following⁣ the announcement. “Executing states must now go underground if ⁢they want to get ​hold of medicines for use ‌in lethal ⁢injection.”\n\nFederal⁢ death penalty\n\nThough lethal injection is the execution method most commonly used in the U.S.,‍ the rate⁢ of botched executions in recent years has been ‍high, said⁤ Denno, pointing to‍ a report from ​the Death Penalty‌ Information Center which found ​that more than one-third of executions in 2022 were botched.\n\nIn its report, the Death Penalty ​Information Center quotes Austin Sarat, professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, defining ⁤botched executions as “those involving unanticipated problems or delays that caused, at least arguably, ‌unnecessary‌ agony for the prisoner⁣ or that⁣ reflect gross incompetence of the executioner.”\n\nAs states experience difficulties ⁢with botched executions, inmates surviving ‌execution attempts and the⁣ ability to source drugs, Denno said some states are looking toward the firing ‍squad and other states​ are⁤ considering abandoning the death penalty altogether.\n\nTwenty-seven states retain the death penalty‍ and 23 states have abolished it, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.⁢ The ‌federal government also retains the death penalty.\n\nThe Justice Department recently indicated that it would seek the death penalty for ​the man who⁢ carried the racially motivated shooting in May 2022 at a⁤ Tops Supermarket in ​Buffalo, New York. “United States ⁢believes the circumstances in counts 11-20 of the indictment are such ⁣that, ⁢in the event of ⁢a conviction, ‌a sentence of death is justified,” the court filing said.\n\nThe shooter was already sentenced to life without parole in New York, but the‌ Department of Justice is seeking the death penalty on federal chargers the ‍man faces.

The Defense Ministry⁣ in Moscow said a military commission was‌ headed to the scene.\n\nThe Russian military said the POWs were being flown to the region for a prisoner swap when the plane‌ was⁣ downed at 11:15 a.m. local time. ⁤The Il-76 is designed to ⁣carry ⁣up‌ to 225 troops, cargo, ⁢military equipment and weapons, according‍ to Russia’s military⁤ export agency.\n\nThe Ukrainian military intelligence spokesman, Andrii Yusov, confirmed to media‌ that a prisoner swap was to happen‍ Wednesday but was not going‍ ahead. He said‌ the agency is checking whether ​Ukrainian POWs ‍were on the plane.\n\nThe Russian Defense ‍Ministry ⁣said​ the plane was headed to⁣ the Belgorod region from the Chkalovsky airfield in the Moscow region, and‌ the POW swap was scheduled to ⁤take place⁤ at the Kolotilovka crossing on the Russian-Ukrainian border. The crossing is about 85⁢ miles west​ of the village of Yablonovo, near where the plane crashed.\n\nRussian officials and ‌lawmakers expressed outrage and questioned whether there should be further prisoner swaps. The⁣ most ​recent one, brokered by the⁢ United Arab Emirates, took place this month and was the biggest to date,‌ with 230 Ukrainian POWs returning ‍home and 248 Russians released. It was the first in almost⁣ five months⁣ and the 49th of the war.\n\nRussia has largely ensured its air dominance during the war against Ukraine’s fleet of Soviet-era ‌warplanes. But Russia has suffered a ⁤series of crashes that some observers have attributed to a higher number of flights amid the ⁤fighting in Ukraine.\n\nAt the same time, Kyiv⁤ has boasted of shooting down two Russian command and ‍control ‍planes, which would be a major feat for Ukraine if‍ true. Cross-border attacks on⁤ Russia’s Belgorod region also have increased, ⁤with the​ deadliest one killing 25 people in December.\n\nShortly⁣ before the⁤ crash, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said on his Telegram channel a “missile alert” had​ been triggered in the region.\n\nUkraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment ⁢of ⁣Prisoners of War said it was looking into the crash but⁢ did not immediately provide any information. Instead, it cautioned against sharing “unverified information.”\n\n“We​ emphasize that the enemy is actively ​conducting information special operations against⁢ Ukraine aimed ⁣at‍ destabilizing Ukrainian society,”​ it‍ said in‌ a statement on Telegram.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told ⁢reporters in the morning that he could not comment⁤ on ⁢the crash because‍ he⁤ didn’t have enough information about it. There was no comment from the​ Kremlin later in the day.\n\nThe war’s 930-mile front line has⁣ been largely static amid a second winter of fighting. As both sides seek to replenish their⁤ weapons stockpiles, the war recently has focused on long-range strikes.\n\nUkraine’s allies have promised more​ military aid⁤ even though their resources are stretched. Help from the United ⁢States, by far Ukraine’s single biggest provider, has also hit political snags.\n\nrnrn\n\nBreaking News:‌ Russian military transport plane crashes near Ukraine border\n\nTragic news has ‍emerged from the Belgorod border region of Russia, where a Russian military transport plane crashed, killing all 74 people aboard. ⁢Moscow has ⁤accused‌ Kyiv of shooting down the plane, claiming that 65 of the victims were Ukrainian prisoners of war who were headed for a swap. However, Ukraine⁣ has not ​confirmed or denied these allegations.\n\nThe crash, which was captured on video and shared on ‍social media, showed the plane falling from the sky and erupting into a massive ball‍ of fire upon impact with‍ the ground. The cause ​of the crash is⁤ still unknown, and conflicting accusations between Russia ‍and Ukraine have made it difficult‍ to establish the facts.\n\nWhile the Russian Defense Ministry claims that the plane was ⁢carrying‌ Ukrainian POWs and⁢ was shot down by missiles launched from Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, ⁢a U.S. official has cast doubt on these claims, stating that it’s unclear whether there were actually Ukrainian prisoners aboard the aircraft.\n\nThe crash has raised tensions between the two ⁣neighboring countries, which have been engaged in a 700-day war. Both‍ sides​ have ⁣experienced losses in their airspace, with​ Russia losing two warplanes‌ and two helicopters ‍in a single day in⁢ May 2023,‌ and Ukraine​ boasting of shooting down Russian command and control planes.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, first ‍responders have rushed to the crash site,⁢ and investigations are underway to determine the ⁤cause of the tragedy.

Despite⁣ his win, his only remaining rival, former ⁢U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, vowed⁣ to⁤ continue her‍ campaign.\n\n“This ‌race is far from‌ over,” she ‌told her supporters at a primary night party in Concord, challenging⁣ Trump to‌ debate her. “I’m a fighter. And ⁢I’m‍ scrappy. And now ​we’re the last one standing ⁢next to Donald Trump.”\n\nWith 25% of the expected vote‍ tallied,⁣ according to ‌Edison, Trump had ​55% compared with 43.5% for ⁢Haley, who ⁣had hoped the Northeastern state’s sizable cadre of independent voters⁢ would‍ carry her to ⁤an‌ upset win‍ that might loosen Trump’s iron grip on the Republican ‌Party.\n\nInstead, Trump will become the first Republican to sweep competitive votes in both Iowa‍ — where he won by a⁣ record-setting​ margin eight ​days ago — and‍ New​ Hampshire since ⁣1976, when the two states cemented their status as the first nominating contests.\n\nWhile the final margin ​was still unclear, the results will likely increase calls from some Republicans for Haley to drop out of the race,⁢ though her campaign ‌vowed in a memo on Tuesday to push forward until ⁣”Super ⁣Tuesday” in early March, ‍when Republicans in 15 ⁢states and one⁣ territory vote on ‍the same day.\n\nTrump took to the‌ Truth Social app to let loose⁢ against Haley. ⁣”DELUSIONAL!!!” he ‌posted. A‍ minute later, he added, in reference to Iowa: “SHE CAME IN THIRD LAST WEEK!”\n\nThe next competitive contest is ​scheduled for Feb. 24 ​in South ​Carolina, where Haley was born and ⁢served two ⁤terms as ⁣governor. Despite her ‍ties, however, Trump has racked up endorsements⁣ from most of the state’s Republican figures, and opinion ‍polls show him with ⁤a ‌wide⁣ lead.\n\nHaley finished third in Iowa, just behind Florida Governor Ron‍ DeSantis, while focusing much of her early campaign on New Hampshire, where the more moderate electorate was expected to offer perhaps her best chance of winning a ​state⁣ over Trump.\n\nDeSantis, once seen as⁣ Trump’s most ⁣formidable challenger, dropped out on​ Sunday and endorsed Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Edison projected Biden would win the New Hampshire Democratic primary based on write-in votes, after he ⁤declined to appear on ‌the ballot due to a dispute with the state about the election’s timing.\n\nDespite Trump’s win⁢ on Tuesday, exit polls⁣ hinted at his​ potential vulnerabilities in a general election⁣ campaign. He ​faces four sets of criminal charges for a range of offenses, including his efforts to overturn his 2020​ defeat and his retention of classified documents after leaving the White House in 2021.\n\nAbout 44% of⁤ voters who participated in ‍the Republican primary said he would not be fit to serve if convicted in court,​ according to ​exit polling by Edison.\n\nMore than half said they do not believe Biden ⁢legitimately won the 2020 election,⁤ echoing Trump’s false claims that the result ⁢was tainted by fraud.\n\nThere were also warning ⁣signs for Biden, however. Nearly three-quarters of Republican primary voters said ⁣the economy was either‌ poor or not good, an area where Biden has struggled to highlight his administration’s accomplishments.\n\nRepublicans made up a ⁤smaller share ‍of voters in the primary relative to the state’s 2016 Republican ‍contest​ in​ the state, the exit polls showed. Some‍ 49% of voters considered ⁤themselves Republican, compared to 55% in the 2016 primary.⁣ Six percent said they considered themselves Democrats, compared to 3% in 2016. The share of independents ⁢was little changed ⁢at⁣ 45%.\n\nBiden not‍ on‌ ballot\n\nBiden was not on the ballot ‍in New Hampshire’s Democratic primary, having supported⁤ an effort by ⁤his party to move ‍its first primary election to the⁢ more diverse state of South Carolina.\n\nNew Hampshire supporters were still able to ⁣vote for him by writing Biden’s name on the ballot, offering a barometer ⁢of his⁤ political⁣ strength. With 5% of the estimated vote counted, according to Edison, Biden had 68.3%, far ahead of U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips at 19.6%.\n\nThe Democratic president, whose advisers are anticipating a rematch⁣ with ‌Trump,⁤ took aim at Republicans over their efforts curb ‍abortion rights in‌ a Virginia speech on Tuesday,⁤ but his remarks were interrupted repeatedly by hecklers protesting ⁤his policies toward Israel.\n\nThe U.S. ‌Supreme Court,⁣ with a conservative ‍majority made possible by three justices who joined ⁢the court under Trump, eliminated a nationwide right to ⁤abortion in 2022, galvanizing Democratic voters in that⁢ year’s congressional⁤ elections.\n\nBiden also has cast Trump as a would-be dictator and a threat to democracy.\n\n‘I’m very confident,’ Trump says\n\nTrump, who is⁤ balancing campaign stops with appearances in various ‍criminal and civil courts, denies wrongdoing and has ​used the criminal charges against him to bolster his⁣ claim of political persecution.\n\nHe predicted victory in New Hampshire early on Tuesday, saying the ⁣level of enthusiasm ‌was incredible. Later, during a stop at a polling station in Londonderry, Trump‍ briefly addressed supporters.\n\n“So excited. I’m very confident,” he said.\n\nNew Hampshire, while also a mostly white state with a small population ‌like Iowa, has a more moderate Republican⁣ electorate and a better record of‍ predicting the eventual nominee.\n\nHaley had stepped up her attacks on Trump as ⁤the election drew near, criticizing his affinity for strongmen⁢ such as Russia’s Vladimir Putin‌ and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.\n\nHaley, 52, has also gone after Trump’s age — he is 77 — and ​mental acuity, attacks she has also regularly leveled at Biden, who is ​81.\n\nShe took up the theme ⁢again on Tuesday, saying the country needs ⁤to put someone ​in the White House who can put in eight years to get it back on track.\n\n“Do you want two 80-year-olds running for president?” Haley asked.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/01/24/trump-emerges-victorious-in-new-hampshire-primary-haley-pledges-to-continue-the-fight/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Oppenheimer’ leads the pack with 13 Oscar nominations, while ‘Barbie’ secures 8 nominations","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3048-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"NEW YORK — The⁣ 2023 Academy Awards nominations ⁢were announced today, and the competition is fierce.

The officials, who spoke ⁤on condition of anonymity to discuss a military operation, said Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands contributed to the mission, including with intelligence and‍ surveillance.\n\nIn ⁣a joint statement, the six allied nations said the strikes specifically targeted a Houthi underground storage site ‍and locations ‍associated with the Houthis’⁣ missile ⁢and air surveillance capabilities. They ‌added, “Our aim remains to‌ deescalate tensions ‌and restore stability in the Red Sea, but let us reiterate our‍ warning to Houthi leadership: we will​ not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow⁣ of commerce in one of ‌the⁤ world’s most critical⁣ waterways in the face of continued threats.”\n\n‘Targeted military action’\n\nBritain’s Ministry of Defense‌ confirmed that four Royal Air ⁤Force Typhoon jets struck ‌”multiple targets at⁢ two military sites in the vicinity of Sanaa airfield” with precision-guided bombs. The strikes, said ‌Defense ⁣Secretary Grant Shapps, were “aimed at degrading Houthi capabilities” and would “deal another blow⁤ to⁢ their limited stockpiles⁢ and ability to threaten global trade.”\n\nThe joint operation comes about 10 days after U.S. and British warships and fighter jets struck more than 60⁤ targets in 28 locations. That was ‌the first U.S. military response to what has been a persistent⁣ campaign of Houthi drone and missile ‍attacks ⁣on⁣ commercial ships since the start of the‍ Israel-Hamas war in October 2023.\n\nThe Houthis’ media office said in an online statement that raids targeted Yemen’s capital, Sanaa. And Jamal Hassan, a resident⁢ from south Sanaa, told the Associated Press that‍ two strikes landed near his home, setting off car alarms in the street. An Associated ​Press journalist in Sanaa also heard aircraft flying above the skies of Sanaa overnight Monday.\n\nAl-Masirah, a Houthi-run satellite news channel, said there were multiple air raids on three areas ‍of‌ Sanaa: al-Dailami Air‌ Base just⁤ north of the capital, Sarif, northeast of the⁢ city center, and al-Hafa,⁤ which⁣ is south of Sanaa.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke with President Joe Biden earlier Monday. Sunak’s office said the two leaders agreed to take “as needed, targeted military action to degrade Houthi capabilities.”\n\nThe latest barrage of allied attacks marks the eighth time the U.S. has conducted strikes on Houthi sites since Jan. 12. And it follows⁣ an almost-daily assault on Houthi missile launchers by U.S.⁣ fighter jets and ship-based Tomahawks over ‌the past week. The rapid response missions, which officials said⁢ go after launchers that ‍are armed and ready to‌ fire, demonstrate the ​military’s increasing ability⁤ to ​watch, detect and strike militant activities in Yemen.\n\nThe chaotic wave of attacks and reprisals involving the United States, its ‍allies and foes suggests that the retaliatory strikes haven’t deterred the Houthis from their campaign against Red Sea shipping, and that the broader regional war that the U.S. has spent months trying to avoid is becoming closer to reality.\n\nFor months, the Houthis have attacked ships in the region’s waterways that they say are either linked to Israel or heading⁣ to Israeli ports.⁢ They say their attacks aim to end the Israeli air-and-ground offensive in the Gaza Strip that was triggered by the Palestinian militant group ⁢Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel. But any such links to the ships targeted in the rebel assaults have grown more tenuous as​ the attacks continue.\n\n‘This blatant aggression’\n\nThe U.S. and allies⁢ warned‌ of retaliation for weeks, and the White House and a host of partner nations issued a final warning⁢ on Jan. 3 to the Houthis to cease the⁢ attacks or face ​potential military action.\n\nThat threat, however, had little noticeable effect. The⁤ Houthis ⁤continued to attack ships‍ in the region, ​including at times appearing to target⁢ U.S. ⁤Navy and U.S.-owned ships, in addition to the ⁢wide range⁣ of commercial vessels.\n\nOf the eight strike missions on Yemen this month, all but the two with Britain⁤ were conducted by the U.S. military alone. Five of the latest strikes were labeled ‍self-defense⁢ to take out missiles ready to fire. The most recent, on Saturday,​ struck and ⁣destroyed a Houthi anti-ship⁤ missile ​that was aimed into the Gulf of Aden and was prepared ⁣to launch, according to‌ Central Command.\n\nThe Biden administration has⁢ also put the Houthis back on its list of specially designated ‍global terrorists. The sanctions that come with the formal designation are⁤ meant to sever violent extremist groups from their sources of financing, while also allowing vital humanitarian aid to continue flowing to impoverished Yemenis.\n\nU.S. defense officials have ⁢said they believe the strikes have degraded the ⁢Houthis’ weapons and strike capabilities.‍ But Biden and others have acknowledged ​that the rebels are well-equipped by Iran and‍ are likely to continue ⁢the attacks.\n\nThe Houthis, meanwhile, have made it clear that they have no⁤ intention of ⁤scaling back⁤ their assault. In the wake⁣ of the first U.S. ⁢and British joint attack, Hussein ⁤al-Ezzi, a Houthi official in‌ their Foreign Ministry,​ said, “America and Britain will undoubtedly have to prepare to pay a heavy price and bear all the dire consequences of this blatant aggression.”\n\nThe continued harassment⁢ of the ships has driven the U.S. and international partners to take extraordinary steps to defend them through ​a joint mission named ⁢Operation Prosperity‌ Guardian, in which they‌ provide a protective umbrella for vessels traveling the critical waterway that‌ runs from the Suez Canal down to the Bab⁣ el-Mandeb Strait.\n\nAbout 400 commercial vessels transit the southern Red Sea at any given time. And ⁢the ⁢ongoing violence has prompted companies⁢ to reroute their⁢ ships,‌ sending them around Africa through the Cape of Good Hope instead — a much longer ⁤and less efficient passage.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/01/23/us-and-british-military-conduct-joint-airstrikes-on-several-houthi-locations-in-yemen/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Navy confirms the deaths of 2 SEALs missing in Gulf of Aden","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3021-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"WASHINGTON —‌ Two Navy SEALs ⁢who went‌ missing in the Gulf of‍ Aden earlier this month during a raid on ⁤a ​boat carrying Iranian weapons have not been located following an⁣ exhaustive search and their ⁣status has‍ been changed to deceased, military officials said on Sunday.\n\nThe SEALs were reported missing after boarding the vessel in a Jan. 11 operation ‍near ⁢the coast of Somali, the U.S. Central Command said on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n“We mourn the loss of ⁤our two Naval Special Warfare warriors, ⁢and we will forever honor their sacrifice and ‌example.

This trend continued ​in 2023, with⁢ the average⁤ rate on a ⁣30-year mortgage reaching 7.79% by late October, the‍ highest ⁣level since late 2000.\n\nHowever, there is hope for a rebound in‍ home ⁣sales, as mortgage rates have ‍been⁢ easing since November, echoing a pullback ⁢in‍ the 10-year Treasury yield. The ⁢average rate on a 30-year home loan was 6.6% this week, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. ‌Many economists expect rates to continue to ease, which ⁤should help boost demand heading into the spring homebuying season.\n\nDespite the easing mortgage rates, the housing market ⁤is​ still ​facing a demand-supply imbalance, with just ​1 million homes‍ on the market at the end of December. This is a 4.2% increase from a year earlier, but well below the monthly historical average of about 2.25 million. The available inventory at the end ⁣of last month amounts to a 3.2-month ⁣supply, down 3.5% from the previous month.\n\nAs a result, homebuyers are ‍likely to face intense ⁤competition for the relatively few homes on the market, which should keep pushing up prices.​ First-time homebuyers, in particular, are finding it ⁣challenging to enter ⁣the housing market, accounting for ‍just 29% of all homes sold last month, down⁣ from 31% in November and December 2022.\n\nDespite these challenges, there is optimism that the housing market will begin⁣ to bounce back from its dismal showing in 2023. With mortgage rates expected to continue easing and more inventory expected to ⁣appear on the market in the upcoming​ months, there is hope for a turnaround in the housing market.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/01/20/home-sales-hit-30-year-low-in-2023-due-to-frustrating-mortgage-rates/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Alec Baldwin indicted by grand jury for fatal shooting of cinematographer on New Mexico film set","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2982-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"SANTA FE,⁤ N.M. ‌- In a ‍shocking turn of events, Alec Baldwin⁢ has been indicted on an involuntary manslaughter charge in connection with the tragic 2021 fatal shooting on the set of the movie ‌”Rust” in ⁢New Mexico.

With the new pay structure, store managers will now have a pay⁤ range between $90,000 and $170,000, based on the store format they oversee.\n\nBut that’s not all.

The National Student Legal Defense Network, the ‍Center for Law and Social Policy, ⁣and the⁤ California Student Aid Commission are among the organizations advocating for the‌ removal of this ⁤requirement. A⁣ spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture has confirmed ‍that the agency is currently reviewing the proposal.\n\nSNAP plays a ‌crucial role in helping low-income families supplement their budgets so they can purchase groceries, snacks, and nonalcoholic beverages. Currently, an estimated 42 million Americans receive ⁣monthly benefits at an average of $212 per person or $401⁤ per household.\n\nUnder the current regulations, within 30 days of applying for SNAP, ‍a state agency must conduct an applicant’s initial certification interview,​ either by phone or in person.\n\nExpedited interviews‌ may be scheduled within a seven-day ‍window​ for individuals ‌in particular ‌need who meet specific income criteria. Seasonal​ farm workers, migrants, and certain other households may also qualify for expedited interviews.\n\nEligible households⁢ then⁣ receive a notice indicating their certification period, or ‌how long they will receive SNAP benefits. Before that period ends, the participant’s local SNAP office‌ contacts them with information on how to recertify.\n\nAviana Kimani, a 24-year-old student at West Los Angeles College, shared her experience of receiving SNAP benefits for a year and a half before leaving the program. She ⁢cited the difficulty of scheduling the mandated recertification⁢ interview as one of the reasons for leaving the program.\n\nKimani explained that the process of going to ‍the social services office in person to renew her eligibility ‍during its open‍ hours was challenging due to work and school obligations. She also mentioned that the paper-based nature of the SNAP assistance program added an extra ‌layer of‌ complexity, especially when she was moving and had to change ⁤her address post-move.\n\n“You don’t get to pick the time — it’s just given to⁣ you ‍— and, usually since it’s during the day, it can inconvenience you if you work or go to school,” Kimani said. “You also ​don’t know how‌ long the call will ​be. If I ​didn’t have to go through the ⁢screening process, I definitely would have been on benefits longer. But if you don’t keep up, you’re knocked⁤ off.”\n\nWhen SNAP was established in 1978, the Agriculture Department retained the interview requirement inherited from the previous food stamp program, stating that the‍ interview helps the agency understand a household’s circumstances and helps the household understand the⁤ program.\n\nHowever, the organizations petitioning the government argue that⁢ the current regulatory requirement is an outdated​ bureaucratic⁤ hurdle and is not mandated by the federal ⁣statute governing the SNAP program.\n\nA 2021 review of enrollment data in California found that​ 31% of SNAP applicants in Los Angeles County were denied​ SNAP due⁢ to missing their interview, compared to just 6% who were denied for failing to meet ⁤eligibility requirements. Missed-interview denials were even higher among working families and‍ college applicants, affecting as many as 40% ⁢of otherwise eligible applicants.\n\nAllan‌ Rodriguez, press secretary for the USDA, stated that 78%​ of people⁣ eligible‍ for SNAP participated in the program and received benefits from October 2019 to February 2020, the last pre-pandemic period from which data ​is available.\n\nDuring the pandemic, ‍when ​interview and other requirements were eased, the USDA encouraged states to use existing program flexibility to improve access to ⁢SNAP, such as by using online or phone SNAP applications or allowing participants to stay on SNAP without reapplying for the maximum ​amount of time allowed.\n\nAccording to Ty Jones Cox, vice president for ⁢food assistance at the Center‍ for Budget⁣ and Policy Priorities, the changes contributed to ‍hunger staying level in⁢ 2020, rather than increasing during the‍ early stage of the ​pandemic. That’s in ‍contrast to during the 2008 recession, when it increased from 11.1% to 14.7%.\n\n“Hunger was poised to soar early in the COVID-19 pandemic, but SNAP’s structure and policy changes​ made it easier⁢ for families to access SNAP during⁢ this period,” she said.\n\nKimani also says the pandemic proved the policy change can be done.\n\n“During COVID-19 ⁤they allowed people to be automatically recertified to continue their benefits, instead of using an appointment in person to ​determine eligibility,” she said. “I wonder why we can’t continue that way to ensure people don’t lose ‌benefits.”\n\nIn a recent report, the Center for⁤ Budget and Policy Priorities found that the interview requirement “can be an important way for states to gather accurate information and for applicants to have their ⁤questions answered, but it can be a labor-intensive⁣ task and delay approval.”\n\nStudent Defense President Aaron Ament said the organization hears too often about obstacles students face to ⁣scheduling the required government SNAP interviews when juggling schoolwork, a ​job, and child care or elder care.\n\nThe Associated Press⁣ receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to⁤ improve financial literacy. ⁣The independent foundation is separate from Charles ​Schwab and Co.

That’s barely within the international goal countries agreed to ‍in the 2015 Paris Climate Accord to avoid a world devastated by climate⁤ change. In all, 2023 shattered annual heat records.\n\nScientists and energy experts ⁤have long laid‌ out roadmaps — solutions⁣ — to reduce ⁤greenhouse gases like ‍carbon dioxide and methane that are heating up the planet. And there’s hope for⁢ the way forward, the International Energy Agency said in its World Energy Outlook for 2023.\n\nLed by solar and electric vehicles, investment in clean energy⁤ has⁢ risen by 40% since 2020. Proponents of nuclear power ‍say ramping up that carbon-free⁢ source can replace fossil fuels now as‍ a way of making‌ electricity.\n\nSharp ⁤cuts ⁢in methane emissions have become a global ‍priority, as shown by the ‌discussions at the‌ United⁢ Nations COP28 climate talks in Dubai last ​month. Each person can also‍ reduce their ⁣impact on the environment ‍through the choices they make, whether that’s saving energy at home,‌ switching to an electric vehicle, reducing air ⁣travel or eating less ‌meat and more plant-based foods.\n\nBelow⁣ is a closer look at all of these solutions.\n\nRenewables ⁣rollout\n\nNearly 200 countries agreed last month at COP28 to move⁤ away from fossil fuels by tripling the use of renewable energy by 2030. ⁢It was the first⁢ time they’ve made that crucial pledge to transition, but it will ​require new ⁤installations at double the current rate.\n\nUN chief António ⁤Guterres said a fossil fuel phaseout‌ is “inevitable.” Scientists overwhelmingly agree the world needs to⁤ drastically cut the burning ‍of ‍coal, oil ‍and​ gas to limit global warming. That’s because when fossil fuels are burned, carbon dioxide forms and is released.\n\nAs an⁤ example, a 200-megawatt onshore wind project consisting of ⁢roughly 50 turbines, on average, avoids the emissions equivalent ⁤of taking 100,000 cars​ off the‌ road or planting 20 million trees, according to the American Clean Power Association. The ⁢United States, which has lagged far behind⁢ Europe and Asia in building large offshore wind farms,​ now has two sending power to ⁢the grid ⁢that could fully open early this year.\n\nNew nuclear\n\nTo control global warming, the IEA ⁢says global⁢ nuclear capacity needs to ⁢expand by about 3% each year. The global nuclear industry launched an initiative at COP28 for nations to pledge to triple nuclear‌ energy by 2050. More than 20 have already signed on, including the United States and the ​host of ⁤the talks, the United‌ Arab Emirates.\n\nThe World Nuclear Association says this form of electricity can be deployed on a large ‍scale in time to combat climate​ change by directly replacing⁣ fossil fuel plants. Unlike fossil fuel-fired power plants, ​nuclear ‌reactors do not produce carbon dioxide while ‍operating.\n\nU.S. nuclear companies are​ also working on the next generation of reactors that are far smaller ​and‍ cheaper than traditional ⁤ones. These small modular reactors and microreactors ⁢in the⁢ future could power ‌a community, campus ⁢or military complex. Skeptics, however, caution that nuclear technology still comes with significant safety, security and environmental risks ⁤that other low-carbon energy sources don’t.\n\nLess methane\n\nMethane, or natural ⁤gas, is⁢ an extraordinarily powerful greenhouse gas, more‍ potent at trapping‌ heat⁢ than carbon dioxide. It’s responsible ​for about 30% of ‌today’s global warming.\n\nMany nations are prioritizing bringing down methane emissions as ‍a crucial, quick way ‍to curb further warming, because it doesn’t last as long as carbon dioxide in ⁢the atmosphere absorbing the sun’s ⁤heat.\n\nThe Biden administration last month issued a final ‌rule aimed at reducing methane‌ emissions, targeting the U.S. ⁣oil and natural gas industry for its​ role.\n\nSeparately, 50 oil companies representing nearly half of‌ global production pledged at COP28 to reach‌ near-zero methane emissions and stop wasting natural gas by⁢ burning it ​off, by 2030. Environmental groups,‍ however, called the pledge a “smokescreen​ to hide​ the reality that we need to phase out ‍oil, gas and coal.”\n\nPersonal choices\n\nEvery individual can make choices that protect‍ the environment and slow climate ​change, according to the United ​Nations’ sustainable development goals.\n\nThe UN says ⁣to start saving energy​ wherever possible —⁣ reduce heating and cooling, switch‍ to LED light bulbs and energy-efficient electric appliances, wash laundry in cold water and hang ​things to dry. Improving a home’s ⁣energy efficiency through better insulation or replacing an oil‍ or gas furnace with an electric heat ‍pump can reduce the equivalent​ of ⁤up to 900 kilograms of CO2 per year.\n\nSwitching from a gasoline or diesel-powered car ​to an electric vehicle, taking fewer flights and shifting from a diet reliant on meat to a vegetarian one can also make significant dents in one’s carbon ⁤footprint, the UN said. Producing plant-based foods generally results in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and requires less energy, land and water.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2024/01/14/record-breaking-temperatures-in-the-past-year-solutions-for-a-sustainable-future/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"USDA projects 21 million children to receive summer food assistance from new program by 2024","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2835-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced that​ nearly 21 million children in the U.S. and its territories will receive food benefits this summer through the Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer program (Summer⁤ EBT).

The Republicans attribute the surge in illegal immigration to the rollback of some restrictive border policies of former President Donald Trump, the leading candidate of the Republican party.\n\nDespite the impeachment effort, it is highly unlikely that Mayorkas will be convicted in a trial ⁣in the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats. However, the political tension surrounding the issue continues to escalate.\n\nMeanwhile, a bipartisan group of ⁤senators held a negotiating session to discuss ways to bolster security along the southwestern ⁢border with Mexico.

The goal is to get authorities,⁢ particularly a SWAT team, to show‌ up.

The FBI said earlier this year ​that it had created a national database in ​conjunction with other law ​enforcement agencies to‍ track swatting incidents nationwide.

Nearly 100 volunteers quickly‍ and methodically sifted through⁢ thousands‍ of ​pounds of freshly donated food.\n\nThe daily appointments‍ are booked solid ​through the end of January,‌ and demand has ⁤been overwhelming for The Open Door’s other ​community-based food distribution events.\n\nWhile 2023 ‍was the year that meaningful progress was⁣ made on slowing down painfully high inflation, 33 months’ worth of fast-rising​ prices took their toll on many Americans, ‍especially those with lower incomes.\n\nTo that point,​ this year also marks⁢ a record year for food⁤ pantry⁣ visits ⁣in⁢ Minnesota and beyond — in many ⁢cases, by a country mile.\n\n“The years of inflation, they stacked on top of each other,” said Jason Viana, The⁤ Open⁤ Door’s executive director. “We were seeing the impact of (rising wages), but inflation wiped ​all that out.”\n\nTurning the corner?\n\nIn 2022, the U.S. saw ‌inflation‍ spike to levels not seen in four decades, and the Federal Reserve​ was in the throes of⁣ a historic rate-hiking campaign to cool ⁢it back down.\n\nAt the start ‌of⁣ this year, inflation had moderated some — the Consumer Price Index⁣ had cooled to 6.5% in January 2023 from its 9.1% peak in June⁤ 2022.

Getting enough sleep is vital, though⁢ getting too much sleep is not good.\n\nThe researchers said that five sleep habits add close to five years ⁢to ‌a man’s life expectancy⁢ and two-and-a-half⁣ years to a woman’s. Those⁢ five sleep factors are:\n\nSleeping seven to eight hours a night.\nStruggling to fall asleep no more than two times a week.\nHaving trouble staying asleep two times a week or ‌less.\nNot using sleep medication.\nFeeling well-rested when you wake up at least‍ five days a week.\nHaving⁢ a⁤ consistent sleep schedule.\n\nYou can read more about ⁢this‍ sleep research here.\n\nAmericans say career​ choices ‍are key to their happiness\n\nAmericans — including religious folks — increasingly believe ​choosing the right career path is more vital to happiness‍ and​ a good ⁣life​ than choosing the right spouse. That’s according to findings in a Pew‌ Research Center report published in September.\n\n“In every religious ‍group analyzed, two-thirds or more say having a job or career they⁤ enjoy is extremely or⁤ very important for⁣ people to live a fulfilling life,” Pew reported. “By comparison, ⁤having children and being married‌ ranks lower among all religious groups.”\n\nAs Kelsey​ Dallas reported for the Deseret News, ‌”To be‌ clear, people ⁤of faith generally aren’t negative ⁣about marriage, although they view it as less of ⁣a fulfillment-driver than ⁣other things.”\n\nRead more⁢ about faith and ⁣family formation here.\n\nAmericans worry ⁢about the future of the family\n\nThe ⁤same Pew report ‍found‍ that close to 4 in 10 Americans are⁤ pessimistic about the future of the family. A quarter ⁤— 25% — say they feel optimistic, while 29% say they‍ are neither.\n\nWhen the​ survey asked respondents whether specific ⁢trends ⁣are positive or negative for the future, the one⁤ seen as most negative is ⁤”fewer children raised by two married parents.” Nearly half see that as a ​negative, compared to just over 1 in 10 who believe it’s a positive, the report said.\n\nMore consider fewer people ever getting married a negative (36%) than ⁢see it as a positive (9%). Twice as many (29%) see cohabiting as negative than see​ it ⁣as positive (15%).\n\nBut when it comes to having fewer children, the numbers are very ⁤similar: 27% call that negative and ⁣25% call that positive.\n\nFind five more findings from‌ that survey here.\n\nMarriage is still an​ aspiration, but not seen as crucial to ‌thrive\n\nMarriage ⁤is popular and most Americans ⁣who have never wed ⁢hope to do⁤ so one⁤ day. ​But the marriage rate is declining ⁤and more children are being ⁣born to‌ unwed‌ parents.\n\nThat’s‍ according ‌to the ⁢newest‍ American Family⁢ Survey, ⁢conducted ⁤by YouGov for ⁣Deseret News and BYU’s Center for the Study of Elections ‌and Democracy and the university’s Wheatley‍ Institute.

Representatives passed only 27 bills that were signed into law, despite voting more than 700 times.\n\nThat’s ⁣down from⁤ 248 bills signed ⁤in ‍2022, on 549​ House votes, according ‌to records from the‍ Library of Congress.\n\nThis dearth of legislation is⁤ certainly ‌the result of divided government — Democrats control the Senate and White House while Republicans hold‍ the House — but that doesn’t tell the entire story.‌ For⁢ instance, the Republican-controlled House passed 72 bills that became⁢ law in 2013, when Democrats similarly held the Senate and presidency, according to the New York Times.\n\nRepublicans won only a narrow majority in the House during the 2022 midterm elections, leaving little room for defection among the⁤ caucus and ‌empowering a handful of far-right members ‍who have been staunchly opposed⁤ to compromising with Democrats on many issues.\n\nMcCarthy — who⁤ acquiesced ‌to that contingent’s demand to change House rules to make it ‌easier for any ⁢one member to call for⁤ his removal⁤ — was ousted in another historic vote ‌in October, after he angered his right flank by working with Democrats on⁢ a bill to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nHis ouster ​paralyzed the chamber for three‌ weeks as Republicans scrambled to pick‌ a ‌replacement before ⁢settling on the relatively⁣ unknown Rep. Mike Johnson, ⁤R-Louisiana. Johnson was elected ​speaker following four votes on the House ⁤floor and after⁤ the⁤ Republican caucus nominated a series of candidates including Reps. Steve Scalise, Jim Jordan and Tom ‌Emmer.\n\nThe GOP’s⁣ slim‍ majority further shrunk in September with the resignation of Rep. Chris ‍Stewart, R-Utah. Stewart’s seat remained vacant‌ until late November, when Rep. Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, was sworn in to replace‍ him.\n\nRepublicans enjoyed a full caucus for⁢ only a few days before Rep. ⁤George Santos, ​R-New​ York, was expelled by his colleagues following a scathing congressional investigation that found he used campaign money for spa treatments, ⁤Botox, luxury clothing and OnlyFans, an online platform ⁢known for sexual content.\n\nThe lack of legislation in 2023 doesn’t necessarily portend similar inactivity in Congress next year. Historically, lawmakers pass more laws in the second year of each ‌Congress, according to Axios, but with what is sure to be a⁤ highly polarizing 2024 presidential campaign looming and a narrowly‌ divided government, it’s anyone’s⁤ guess.\n\nBipartisan cooperation in Utah\n\nUtah’s lawmakers stand in stark contrast to‌ those in Washington, after the Beehive State’s Legislature passed a record 575 bills during its legislative session that wrapped‍ up in March. That’s⁣ according to Adam Brown, an associate professor of political ‍science at Brigham Young ⁣University who created and ⁣maintains an online database to track legislative ‌efforts.\n\nCongress and‌ the Utah Legislature don’t make for an apples-to-apples comparison, most notably because Utah has a Republican governor and is represented ⁢by a supermajority of Republicans in both chambers of the Legislature, making it much easier for the GOP to advance its preferred policies.\n\nState lawmakers also generally have to pass bills on a single subject, as opposed to the colossal ​omnibus spending and defense bills approved annually by Congress.\n\nBut Utah’s‍ productivity numbers aren’t just a result of circumstance; they reflect a higher degree of bipartisan cooperation than is usually seen in Washington of⁣ late.\n\nThe vast majority of bills ⁣in the Utah House⁢ and Senate in 2023 passed with bipartisan support, with‍ only 14% and 9% of votes decided along⁤ party lines in each ‌chamber,⁢ respectively, according to Brown’s data.\n\nIn the House, the average voting majority ⁢on‌ each ​bill included 93% of representatives, which means an average of 8.75 Democrats crossed over to vote with Republicans, assuming⁤ that the majority was united. Ninety-seven percent of senators on ‍average were aligned on the winning side of each⁤ vote, which means on average, all but one of the six Democratic senators sided with the majority in the same scenario.\n\nOf course, ‌several high-profile and⁢ controversial bills are passed strictly on ‌party lines each year, but most legislative work is done with buy-in from both sides.\n\nThe fact that party control of‌ the Utah Legislature is practically never in doubt likely contributes to less partisanship than ‍in Washington, according to Brown, because it ​disincentivizes the “cheap shots” ⁣that often make headlines in national politics.\n\n“Usually the better strategy for the minority here is to try to get along as well as they can,” he told ​KSL.com in March. “Most people don’t realize a solid majority of ⁤the ‌bills are passing with⁢ bipartisan support. Most​ people don’t realize ‍the ⁣Democrats ⁤have​ managed to pass a lot of their bills …⁣ and part of that is because both parties⁣ aren’t just running partisan headline-grabbing bills.\n\n“There are a lot of bills (suggested) by agencies, by local governments, by industries in Utah who are pointing out, ⁢’Hey, there’s an ambiguity in the law here,'” Brown said.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2023/12/26/2023-a-year-of-numerous-votes-and-few-congressional-bills-but-not-in-utah/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"65 years later, a family rediscovers lost history after mother’s wallet is found","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2412-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"ATLANTA – A Time Capsule ⁣Unearthed at the Plaza Theatre\n\nHidden behind a crumbled wall in‌ the bathroom of the Plaza Theatre, contractors discovered‍ a time capsule frozen in time.

Ruth was traveling via Greyhound bus from her parents’ house in Olympia, Washington, to her home in Seattle, Washington.\n\nShe’d spent ⁢a fun, festive ⁢day with her family. But Ruth was working Dec. 26, and needed to get back in⁤ time. ⁤She​ was 18, it was her first job, and she didn’t want to risk being late.\n\n“So I took the Greyhound bus and I⁤ got on, and I sat down in the first seat that was available, which was next to this good-looking young man,” Ruth tells CNN Travel⁣ today.\n\n“I promptly went to sleep and I⁤ woke up with my head on‌ his shoulder.”\n\nStill slightly bleary-eyed, Ruth blushed when she realized what had happened. She apologized to the stranger next to her, straightened her blouse and tried to regain some composure.\n\n“Oh my goodness, I’m sorry,” she said.\n\nBut the man ‌waved her apologies away, smiled and introduced himself.\n\nThis was 21-year-old Andy Weller. He’d been on the bus since Astoria, ⁣Oregon,⁢ and was heading to the military base at Fort ⁣Lewis, Washington, where he⁣ was ⁤stationed.\n\nAndy had noticed Ruth as soon as​ she’d boarded the bus.\n\n“I looked at her because I⁢ saw⁣ her beautiful red ‍hair,” he tells CNN Travel today.\n\nAnd‍ he’d noticed when she’d fallen asleep on his shoulder. Andy hadn’t known what to do about it. Should he wake her? Was that rude? What if⁢ she missed her stop?\n\nWhen the Greyhound⁢ reached Nisqually Hill⁢ on Interstate 5, not too far from Fort Lewis, Andy gently‌ nudged ‌Ruth.\n\n“It took me a long time to even get up the gumption because I was shy,” he recalls. “I finally got enough nerve to say, at least, ‘Hi.'”\n\nOver the next 20 minutes, as the bus traveled along Washington’s tree-lined highways, Andy and Ruth made conversation.\n\n“We began to talk to⁤ one another,”‍ says Ruth.⁢ “It was pretty frivolous. You know, ‘What is your name? And how are⁢ you doing? And where are you going?’ And just discovering that we were both headed back to our workplaces.”\n\nThere‍ wasn’t enough time to ‌go much beyond these introductions. But both Ruth and Andy enjoyed the conversation and each other’s company.\n\nThen, the bus pulled up at Fort Lewis.\n\n“This is me,” ‍said Andy. He grabbed⁢ his bag and was about to get off, ‍but then he paused.\n\n“Shall we exchange addresses?” he suggested. Ruth readily‍ agreed.\n\n“So, as the bus stopped at Fort Lewis, I was giving him my address,” she recalls today. “The bus driver ⁤was a little annoyed. He says ‘I’ve ⁤got a‌ schedule to​ keep up.'”\n\nThe two strangers parted ways,​ both ⁢hoping it wouldn’t be the last time they met.\n\nLetters and uncertainties\n\nAndy was a romantic. When he wrote to Ruth for the ⁤first ⁣time, he was already wondering if she might be “the one.”\n\nBut then he learned, via Ruth’s reply, that she was engaged to ​someone else⁤ – a man she’d known since childhood.\n\n“He was in the Air Force. I hadn’t seen him or⁤ been around him ​for almost a year,” explains Ruth.\n\nWhen Ruth met Andy, she still had every intention of marrying her childhood sweetheart. But she also had no qualms about giving Andy her address. There hadn’t been anything specifically romantic about their bus ⁢interactions, after all.\n\n“He had asked for my address, and I ⁣thought, ‘Well, there was‍ no harm in writing back and forth to ⁤someone,” says Ruth.\n\nBut Andy was less ‌sure about the situation.\n\n“I didn’t know where I ‍fit in,” says ⁣Andy today. “I wrote her off.”\n\nBut then, out of the blue, Ruth’s ‍fiancé ⁢ended ⁣the engagement.\n\n“He broke up with me – which ended up being a very good thing,”⁤ she says.\n\nHer ex-fiancé, it turned out, had met ⁤someone else.\n\nRuth was more shocked than ‍upset. She remembers walking into the ⁤living room‍ of her Seattle apartment and ‌sharing the news ‌with​ her roommate. Her friend’s response was pragmatic.\n\n“She said, ‘You’re⁤ not going to just sit here in the apartment and do nothing, and be grumpy and gloomy,'” recalls Ruth.\n\nThe roommate ⁣suggested Ruth could go⁢ out with some of the men they ⁢knew in ​Seattle. Then Ruth’s friend remembered the man from the bus – Ruth should write to Andy and ‍tell ⁣him she was single, Ruth’s roommate insisted.\n\n“She said, ‘If you don’t ⁤pick up a pen and write to this fellow that you got that⁣ letter from, I’m going to⁣ have these others‌ guys come and take you out every night.'” recalls Ruth.\n\n“Well, I wasn’t a going-out person. Every night, that didn’t suit me. So, I wrote the letter.”\n\n“So she did,” says Andy. “And so we got together.”\n\n“We corresponded for‌ quite a while,” says Ruth. “We always looked forward to the letters.”\n\nIn letters‌ sent⁤ back and forth, Ruth and Andy grew closer.\n\n“We shared the things we enjoyed doing and shared the goals we were trying to achieve,”‍ says Ruth.\n\nA ⁣few weeks into their⁣ correspondence, Ruth told Andy she was thinking of moving back to Olympia, Washington, where her parents lived.\n\nAndy suggested he could help Ruth move – ⁣it would be an opportunity to see her again, and see if their epistolary connection translated to real life.\n\n“I went over there,” says⁣ Andy. “I knocked on the door,​ she ⁣opened it. The rest is history.”\n\nTheir chemistry was apparent right away. Almost immediately,​ Andy asked Ruth what she was going to be doing on August ⁣22.\n\n“How should I know?” said Ruth. “Why?”\n\n“Well,⁣ I thought we could get married that⁤ day,” said Andy.\n\n“No way,” said Ruth, laughing.\n\nBut as they boarded another Greyhound bus together ⁣– this time traveling from Seattle ‌to Olympia – Ruth ‍felt‍ more and more sure that she wanted Andy to be part of her life.\n\nThis certainty was only confirmed when “almost halfway between Seattle and Olympia, Andy began singing to me,” says Ruth.\n\n“He sang to me most ⁢of the way back and serenaded me.”\n\nFrom then on, Andy would come to visit Ruth⁤ in Olympia whenever he could. And ⁤whenever they were apart, Andy and Ruth continued their letter-writing correspondence.\n\n“We saw each other every weekend, so much of our‌ letter-writing consisted of what we did during the week, and how ⁢we were missing each other,” recalls Ruth.\n\nOn weekends,​ Andy would borrow an army buddy’s car, pick Ruth up and they’d head to Squaxin Park on the city’s⁤ waterfront.\n\n“We’d hold hands and walk together and talk together,” says Andy.\n\n“I just got to know him,” says Ruth. “And I liked what I saw.”\n\nAn unorthodox proposal\n\nOn July 4,⁣ 1963, Ruth and⁤ Andy were spending the holiday together when Ruth suddenly handed Andy a thick white envelope.\n\nIt ⁣was a wedding​ invite. Andy stared at Ruth in shock.\n\n“I was ⁤wondering if she was marrying the other ⁣guy,” he‍ says, referring to ‍Ruth’s ex-fiancé.\n\n“I started reading it.⁢ And of course, I was kind of distraught at the moment – until I got down to the part that said that she was marrying me.”\n\nRuth had the idea when she was alone one day, during⁤ the week, thinking about Andy and the idea of ⁣a future with him. He’d mentioned marriage again ‌a few times.\n\n“I got ‌to thinking, ‘I really do love this man.’‍ And ⁢so I went‌ to‌ the printers and I ‍had wedding invitations printed up,” recalls Ruth.\n\nRuth had no idea about the wedding venue or ⁢really any of the details. But⁢ she knew when it would take place.‌ There was ​no question about it ‍– August⁢ 22, the date Andy had suggested on their second meeting.\n\nWhen she handed him ‌the invite, Andy was overwhelmed,⁣ then delighted. He hugged Ruth ⁢tightly.\n\nAnd a couple of months later, on August 22, 1963, Andy and Ruth ⁢got⁢ married in‍ Olympia, Washington, at the church Ruth attended as a child. Ruth took⁤ Andy’s name, becoming Ruth Weller.\n\nThe couple extended the wedding invite to all the local churchgoers. They expected about 100 guests, but in the end numbers were closer to 200 – all the people who’d watched Ruth grow up wanted to ⁤be⁤ there to toast her and Andy.\n\nThanks to the ballooning numbers,​ on ‍the day, Ruth realized they didn’t‌ have enough wedding cake for all their ⁤attendees. They had to scramble to ‍find more.\n\n“We had all kinds of different kinds of cakes,” recalls Ruth.. It worked out, and was a special celebration.\n\nGrowing together\n\nRuth and Andy​ were excited to begin married life⁢ together. But they were both very⁤ young, and their first few years‌ together were a learning curve.\n\n“Neither one of us had really dated a whole lot⁣ – like I said, I was engaged to another young man, but I had not dated many​ other young men,” ⁣says Ruth. “And so we basically did grow up together during that time.”\n\nThe couple were also both busy ‌with their jobs. Ruth worked for the state of Washington, Andy ⁢left the army and also started working for⁤ Washington state, in the licensing department.\n\nThe couple realized that they have, as Ruth puts it, “very different personalities.” But they had a similar way of looking at the world and felt like a⁤ team from the beginning. It was “magic”, says Ruth.\n\nThat first Christmas, the anniversary of their meeting, the couple celebrated by going to the ⁣88 cent store together, to do their Christmas⁢ shopping.\n\n“We were just married and things⁣ were tight,” says Andy.\n\nThey giggled as they walked around the store, buying ⁢small gifts for their loved ones. It was their first time giving gifts as a couple, and felt special.\n\nThen, they got together with their family.\n\n“We⁢ always had a close family and just had lots of fun and fellowship with one another,” says Ruth. “My‍ parents⁢ loved ​Andy.”\n\nIn time, Ruth and Andy had three ⁣children. They moved from Olympia, Washington to Yakima, Washington.\n\nThey loved being parents.\n\n“Andy’s a wonderful person. He’s attentive. He’s always been there ⁣for us, his family, in every‌ way,” says Ruth.\n\n“She was ​always there with the children, guiding them, directing them,” says ⁤Andy.\n\n“But has it always been easy? No,” says Ruth.\n\nRuth and Andy’s daughter​ Joanne was born with Maffuci syndrome, a rare bone disorder, and needed a lot of extra care when she was young.\n\n“She grew up to be a very brilliant​ young woman. She was a ⁤911 dispatcher​ for several years. She gave ‌us a lovely grandson,” says Ruth.\n\nJoanne ⁤sadly passed away a few ⁤years ⁢ago.\n\n“We’ve been through things like that ⁤– that a lot of other people don’t have to face and don’t have to figure out how to get through,” says Ruth. “It is true that I believe that ⁤it’s made us stronger in one another.”\n\nOver their decades together, Ruth and Andy have supported one another through the hard times and cheered each other on during the good.\n\nThe key, says Ruth, is “when you find ​the one that’s the right one, hang on tight.”\n\n“Yes, you have to go through hard times,” she says. “But remember, you⁢ go through good times, too. And⁢ those are the ones⁢ that you hold on to‌ and that you keep close to you. And you remember. Those are the things ‌that keep you going.”\n\nFeeling thankful\n\nOver the decades, Ruth and Andy began to associate their love story with one particular‌ song,​ “I Say a Little Prayer,” first recorded by Dionne Warwick in 1967, and later released by Aretha⁢ Franklin the ⁤following year.\n\nAndy would often sing the lyrics to‍ Ruth. The song still resonates with them both today, as they regularly give‍ thanks for one another’s presence in their lives.\n\n“It is a little unusual to​ meet someone​ on a Greyhound bus that you’ve never met before and make a ⁣connection,” says Ruth. “Actually it’s a⁣ miracle that would‍ happen, even – two total⁤ strangers come together and end up being married to one another. And being married ⁢for as long as we have.”\n\nThis past August, Ruth, who is⁣ now ⁣79, and Andy, who is 82, celebrated their 60th wedding ‍anniversary.\n\nTheir wedding anniversary ⁣is an important day to them both – but so is Christmas Day.\n\n“Every Christmas Day we reminisce,” ⁢says Ruth. “We look across the table and know what the other’s ​thinking.”\n\nThis Christmas, the couple will celebrate the day with their ⁤loved ones‍ by their side. Ruth and​ Andy remain close to their family, which ⁣now​ numbers four grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.\n\n“I love being alive ‌and seeing all our grandchildren growing up and their families, and their great-grandchildren,” says Andy.\n\n“It’s absolutely wonderful,” says Ruth. “Their hugs are just so important⁤ to us, especially​ at this age.\n\n“We are looking forward to being ⁣together this Christmas, 61 years after we first met,” she continues. “I’m sure⁢ we will reminisce, laugh, joke, and be teased about our chance meeting those 61 years ago‍ on Christmas Day, ‍1962.”","href":"https://whnynews.com/2023/12/25/couple-who-met-on-christmas-day-on-a-greyhound-bus-celebrates-60-years-of-marriage/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"6-year-old child traveling alone placed on incorrect Spirit Airlines flight","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2386-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"FORT MYERS, Fla. – A heartwarming story of a 6-year-old child’s unexpected adventure on Spirit Airlines has captured the attention of many.\n\nOn December ⁣21, the child was supposed to fly from Philadelphia International Airport⁣ to Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers to visit his grandmother.

Items are aging, and as a deadline to allocate federal COVID-19 cash approaches next year, states must decide how much to invest in maintaining‍ warehouses and supply⁤ stockpiles.\n\nAn Associated Press investigation found at ⁤least 15 states, from Alaska to Vermont, have tossed some of their trove of PPE because​ of expiration, surpluses and a lack of willing⁢ takers.\n\nInto the trash went more ⁤than 18 ⁢million masks, ⁤22‍ million ‍gowns, 500,000 gloves and more. That’s ⁣not counting states that didn’t give ‌the news organization exact figures or responded in ‌cases or other⁣ measures. Rhode Island reportedly got rid of 829 tons⁤ of PPE; ​Maryland disposed of over $93 million in supplies.\n\n“What a real ⁤waste. That’s what happens when you don’t prepare, when ⁢you have ‌a bust-and-boom public health system,” where a lack of planning leads ⁣to panicked over-purchasing in emergencies, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive ‍director of⁤ the American Public Health ‍Association. “It shows that we really have to do a better job of managing our stockpiles.”\n\nThe Associated ​Press sent ​inquiries about PPE stockpiles to all 50 ⁢states over the past several months. About half responded.\n\nStates emphasize that they distributed far more gear than they discarded ​and have gone to great lengths⁤ to donate the leftovers. Washington state sent hundreds of thousands of supplies to the Marshall Islands last year, yet ended up throwing out millions more items after ⁢they⁣ expired.\n\nMany states are keeping at least a portion, and⁤ sometimes all, of their ⁢remaining protective gear. Some even plan to ‍update their stockpiles.\n\nBut others say the vagaries of the pandemic and the PPE supply left no choice⁣ but to acquire the items, and now to throw them out, ⁢however reluctantly. Expiration dates are set because materials can degrade and might not work as intended. The ‌Federal ‍Emergency Management Agency has set the fair market value of expired supplies at zero dollars.\n\n“Anytime you’re ⁣involved in a situation where you’re recalling how difficult it was to get something in​ the first place, and then having to‍ watch ‍that go or not be used in the​ way ⁤it was intended to be used, certainly, there’s some frustration ⁣in that,” said Louis Eubank, who runs the⁤ South Carolina health department’s COVID-19⁤ coordination office. The state has discarded over 650,000 expired⁤ masks.\n\nWhen the virus struck, demand skyrocketed for N95 masks, gloves and gowns. The U.S government’s Strategic ⁢National Stockpile was underequipped, and states plunged into global bidding wars.\n\nThe Associated⁢ Press ‍found in 2020‌ that⁣ states spent over $7⁣ billion in a few months on⁣ PPE, ventilators and some other high-demand medical devices in a seller’s market. Ultimately, the federal government paid for many of the supplies.\n\n“There was no way to⁤ know, at the ‌time of purchase, how long the supply deficit ​would last or what quantities would be needed,” Ohio Department of Health spokesperson Ken Gordon said.\n\nOhio distributed more ​than 227 million pieces of protective equipment during the pandemic. But as the supply crunch and the health crisis eased, demand faded, especially⁢ for gowns.\n\nNow, “states, ⁤hospitals, manufacturers — everybody in the whole system — has extra product,” said Linda Rouse O’Neill of the Health Industry Distributors Association.\n\nGiven the glut, stockpiled items are selling for bargain prices,⁣ if at all. Vermont got $82.50 for 105,000 ⁢boot covers and 29 cents ‌apiece for thousands of‍ safety goggles.\n\nStriking a balance between preparedness and‌ surpluses is “a major dilemma” for governments, said Scott Amey, of the Project on Government Oversight, a Washington, D.C.-based watchdog⁢ group. And while politicians vowed in 2020 never to be ‌caught off guard ‍again, “memories are short, budgets‍ are tight,” Amey noted.\n\nIn ⁢Wisconsin, a legislative committee axed from the budget $17.2 million that would have funded a warehouse with an ongoing 60-day ⁣supply of‌ PPE for two years.\n\nThe state Department of Health Services said it is now “demobilizing the warehouse” and trying to donate the supplies. Already, Wisconsin has tossed nearly 1.7 million masks⁤ and almost 1 million gowns.\n\nMinnesota’s Department of Health was ⁢allocated ‍some money ⁢this year for retaining and restocking PPE and is strategizing. For now, emergency response official Deb Radi says the agency⁣ expects to dispose of a few expiring ‌gowns.\n\nThe Health Industry Distributors Association recommends ​that product distributors maintain a⁣ 60-to-90-day supply to guard against demand‌ spikes. But the group says it’s probably ⁣unnecessary ‌for everyone in the system — from manufacturers to doctors’ offices ‌— to have such a large cushion.\n\nMissouri’s health ⁤department has maintained a 90-day supply, keeping even expired materials on ⁤the presumption that ‌the federal government will OK‌ their use in ​an ‍emergency. That happened during COVID-19.\n\n“If you ‍don’t make the investment – and perhaps the investment ⁤that is never used – then you may not be prepared to assist the public when it’s needed,” Missouri health director Paula Nickelson said.\n\nPennsylvania officials, by contrast, are aiming for a 15-day stockpile after frank ‌conversations about ⁤what they can afford not only to⁤ keep, but to ⁢keep replacing as items expire, said Andy ⁤Pickett, the Health Department’s emergency preparedness and response director.\n\nAnd Nevada can’t ⁢give its aging PPE away ‍fast enough.\n\nDepartment of Administration Director Jack ⁤Robb said ‌the state is⁣ endeavoring to shed the⁤ supplies ​safely and without wasting⁢ money but already has discarded some.\n\nBut⁤ Robb said officials “made the best decisions that they could” when confronted with a disease that has killed nearly ‍7 million⁤ people worldwide, including some of his close friends.\n\n“And I hope we never see anything like that again in our lifetime,” he said.","href":"https://whnynews.com/2023/12/23/states-disposing-of-large-quantities-of-masks-and-pandemic-equipment-while-costly-stockpiles-go-unused-and-expire/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"New report: Recording shows Donald Trump urged Michigan officials to not certify 2020 election results","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2320-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"DETROIT​ — Shocking new revelations have emerged about former President Donald‍ Trump’s attempts to pressure election officials in Michigan not to certify the 2020 vote totals. According​ to‌ a report by The Detroit​ News, a recording of a post-election phone call has been disclosed, in which Trump is heard‍ pressuring two ⁢election officials not to certify the ⁣results in a‌ key Michigan ​county.\n\nThe former president’s 2024 campaign has neither confirmed nor denied the legitimacy of the recording. Instead,⁢ they have insisted that all of Trump’s actions​ after ⁣his defeat to ⁢Democrat Joe Biden were taken to uphold his oath of office and ​ensure fair elections.\n\nDespite multiple recounts and court cases confirming⁢ his defeat, Trump has continued to repeat falsehoods about⁣ the ⁤2020 election as he runs again for the White House. No evidence ⁣has emerged in a litany of federal, state, and outside investigations of voter fraud that‌ could have changed the outcome of the election.\n\nThe Nov. 17, ‌2020, telephone call included then-President Trump, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, and Wayne⁢ County elections authorities Monica Palmer⁢ and William Hartmann, both of them Republicans, The Detroit News reported. Trump told the two canvassers that they would look “terrible” if they certified results after having‌ initially opposed certification, ⁤the newspaper said.​ The two ultimately issued signed affidavits ‌asserting their⁣ opposition to ⁤certifying Wayne County’s results.\n\nThe report comes as Trump⁣ seeks the 2024 Republican nomination while grappling ‍with multiple criminal indictments, including a​ federal case and a Georgia case tied to his efforts to overturn Biden’s victory. As he campaigns for ⁣a return to ​the White House, Trump continues to repeat the lies ⁢that the⁢ 2020 election was stolen.\n\nBiden won Michigan, with Wayne ⁣County, which includes Detroit, providing a trove of⁤ Democratic ⁢votes.​ As such, it was one of the key places Trump focused on in the weeks after Election Day in 2020.\n\n“We’ve​ got to fight for ​our country,” Trump said on the recordings, according to The News. “We can’t let these people take our ​country away from us.”\n\nNational GOP Chairwoman McDaniel, ⁤a Michigan native, reportedly said during the call: “If you can go home tonight, do not sign it,” adding, “We will get you ‍attorneys.”\n\nTrump is said to have reinforced the point, ⁤assuring the local officials: “We’ll take care of that.”\n\nSteven​ Cheung, a Trump spokesman, said in a statement Friday that Trump’s actions were “were taken in furtherance of his duty as President of⁣ the United​ States to faithfully take care ​of the laws and ensure election integrity.”\n\n“President Trump and the American people have the Constitutional right to free and fair elections,”⁢ Cheung said.\n\nThe‍ Republican National Committee’s communications office did not immediately respond Friday to a ⁣request⁢ for comment from​ McDaniel.\n\nThe ⁣new‍ disclosure ​appears⁣ to add details to communications with ​local officials referenced in the Jan. 6 committee’s final report on Trump’s actions after the 2020 election and leading up ​to the Jan. 6, 2021, ⁣attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters on the day that Congress convened to ratify the Electoral College results.\n\nThat‍ congressional report states that Trump and McDaniel ‌called Palmer and Hartmann “about 20 minutes after” the two officials had ​changed their initial votes and agreed to certify the results. “The Select ‍Committee⁣ doesn’t know what President Trump privately said on‌ that phone call,” the report states. The committee states that Hartmann,‌ at the time of the congressional inquiry, said that he was not pressured in a conversation he described as ‍involving “general comments about different states.” But the Jan. 6 committee emphasized Palmer and Hartmann’s decision, made after Trump’s call, ‍to issue the signed affidavits reasserting their original opposition⁣ to certification.\n\nThe​ Michigan call would have occurred about six weeks before another call Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. That conversation is among the ⁣key points in Trump’s indictment in Fulton County‍ that accuses the former president of a racketeering scheme to​ overturn Biden’s narrow victory in Georgia.\n\n“I just want to find 11,780 votes, ⁢which is one more than we​ have,” Trump told Raffensperger⁣ in that call. ‌”Because we won the‌ state.”\n\nGeorgia counted its votes three times before certifying Biden’s win by a 11,779-vote‌ margin.\n\nA recording of Trump is also at issue in a Florida-based federal case accusing the former ‍president⁢ of mishandling classified information after ⁣leaving the White House. In that case, prosecutors allege that⁣ in a July 2021 interview, Trump showed people, who were working on a book about his former ​chief of staff Mark Meadows, classified information about a Pentagon plan of attack on an‌ unspecified‌ foreign‍ country.\n\n“These are ​the papers,” Trump says in a moment that seems to indicate he’s holding a secret Pentagon document. “This was done by the military, given to me.”","href":"https://whnynews.com/2023/12/22/new-report-recording-shows-donald-trump-urged-michigan-officials-to-not-certify-2020-election-results/","nationalNews":true},{"title":"Law enforcement inadvertently guided shooter out of building while searching for UNLV gunman","image":"https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2303-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg","content":"LAS VEGAS — The recent ⁣tragic shooting at‍ the University of Nevada, Las Vegas has left the community in shock and mourning.

The ⁢law is expected to face legal challenges, as immigration enforcement is traditionally​ a federal responsibility.\n\nUnder President Joe Biden’s administration, Texas Republicans have accused the federal government of not doing enough to stop illegal immigration. As a result, Texas ⁤has taken matters into its own hands, busing over ⁢65,000 migrants to cities across America and installing razor wire along the Rio Grande.\n\nIn addition to the new law, U.S. ​Customs and Border Protection temporarily shut down two railroad border crossings in Texas to shift officers to help process migrants, causing disruptions to trade ​ahead of Christmas.\n\nThe new law grants Texas law enforcement ⁢officers the ​authority to arrest individuals suspected of ⁤entering the country illegally. Once in ⁣custody, migrants could either agree to leave the U.S. as ordered by a Texas judge or face misdemeanor charges of illegal entry. Those who do not comply could be arrested on more serious felony charges.\n\nLegal experts have raised concerns‌ about the law’s violation of federal immigration​ enforcement, and Mexico’s government has rebuked⁤ the measure. Immigrant rights groups have criticized President Biden for not intervening sooner to stop Texas’ aggressive border measures.\n\nDespite the controversy, GOP state Rep.‍ David Spiller emphasized that enforcement ‍would‌ primarily take place in border counties and pushed back against concerns that the law would lead to widespread arrests ‍of immigrants statewide.\n\nUnder the new law, migrants ordered to leave would be sent to ports‍ of entry along the border with Mexico,⁣ even if they are not Mexican citizens.

O’Connor ‌retired from the high court​ in 2006 after‍ more than two decades, and died Dec. 1 at age 93.\n\nThe president, a longtime senator ‍who once chaired the Senate⁤ Judiciary‌ Committee, began his remarks ‍by recalling ⁣her 1981 confirmation hearing⁢ — a day that Biden⁣ described as ⁣momentous because of the​ history that she ‌would make on the ⁢nation’s most⁢ powerful court.\n\nHe called her “a pioneer in her own right” who shattered barriers in both the political and legal worlds,⁢ along with the ​”nation’s consciousness.” He said that ‘her principles were deeply held ⁣and of the highest ‌order.”\n\n“How she embodied such attributes under such pressure and scrutiny helped empower generations of women⁢ in ​every ⁢part of ⁢American⁢ life, including the court itself — helping to open doors, secure freedoms and prove⁣ that a woman can ⁤not only​ do anything a‍ man can do, but many times⁣ do it a heck of a lot better,” the⁣ president said.\n\nBiden added: “Excuse ‍my language, Father.”\n\nRoberts, in his eulogy, also highlighted‌ O’Connor’s trailblazing ‌career and said⁢ her leadership shaped the legal profession, making‌ it clear that⁤ justices were both men and women. ⁢She had a distinct style during arguments, often jumping in with a question that cut to the heart of a case, ⁤he said. That put her most important issues on the table quickly, in line with one of her favorite sayings: “Get ⁢it done.”\n\n“She was so successful that the barriers ⁢she broke‌ down are almost unthinkable today,” ⁣Roberts said, calling ‌her a⁤ “strong, ⁢influential⁢ and iconic jurist.”\n\nRoberts had initially been tapped to replace O’Connor, although‍ during his confirmation‌ process, he⁤ was nominated to be chief justice. He recalled ​how O’Connor, in response to ‌questions from reporters about him, said the only issue with the then-nominee was that ⁢he didn’t wear a skirt.\n\n“My initial reaction was, of‍ course, everything’s negotiable,” Roberts ⁣said.\n\nO’Connor was nominated in 1981 by President​ Ronald Reagan. Largely unknown on the national scene⁢ until her appointment, she would ‌come to be referred to‍ by commentators as ‌the nation’s most powerful woman.\n\nO’Connor ⁢wielded considerable ⁤influence on the nine-member court, generally favoring states in⁤ disputes with ⁣the federal government ‍and often siding ⁢with police when they faced ⁤claims of violating people’s rights. Her impact could ⁤perhaps best be seen, though, on the court’s rulings on abortion. She twice helped form the majority in decisions ‌that ⁤upheld⁢ and reaffirmed Roe v. Wade, the decision that said women have a constitutional right to abortion.\n\nThirty years after⁣ that decision, a ⁣more conservative court⁤ overturned Roe, and the opinion was⁤ written by the man who ​took her place, Justice ‌Samuel Alito.\n\nO’Connor was a‌ top-ranked graduate ⁢of Stanford’s law school in‌ 1952, but quickly discovered that most large law firms‌ at the time did not‌ hire women. She nevertheless built a career that included service as a member of the Arizona Legislature and state judge before her appointment to the Supreme Court at​ age 51.\n\nWhen she first arrived, there wasn’t even a women’s bathroom ⁣anywhere near the courtroom. ​That was soon rectified, but she remained the court’s only woman until 1993, when Ruth Bader Ginsburg ⁤joined the ​court.\n\n“She loved​ the law ‌and the Supreme Court,”​ said Jay ‌O’Connor, one of her ‍three sons, during her memorial service. “She loved our country ⁤and our‍ democracy. And most of all, she loved ⁣her ⁢family.”\n\nShe‍ brought a‌ formidable energy to⁤ her personal life as well, her son recalled, noting that her way of relaxing after ‌a long day at work was “three rounds ‌of ‍tennis or 18 holes of golf.”\n\nShe was a voracious reader ‌and, ‍along with her husband John,⁢ a talented dancer — the couple took disco lessons in⁤ Arizona in the ⁤late 1970s. She also ran‌ a bustling household as her three⁣ sons grew up, at​ times employing the ⁢same skills she used‌ to question attorneys in the courtroom.\n\n“She honed those skills grilling her sons about being out late ​on⁢ Saturday night,” he said.\n\nThe late justice’s final message to her three‌ sons, Jay‍ O’Connor said, ⁤included the guidance: “Our purpose in life is to help others along the way.”\n\n“What​ a beautiful, powerful and totally Sandra Day O’Connor sentiment,” he said.\n\nIn a speech before her casket lay in‍ repose Monday, Supreme Court Justice Sonia⁢ Sotomayor remembered O’Connor as a trailblazer and a “living example that women could take on any challenge, could⁣ more than hold their own in ​any spaces dominated by men⁤ and could ‌do so with grace.”\n\nO’Connor⁢ retired at age 75, citing ⁤her husband’s struggle with Alzheimer’s disease. She later expressed ‌regret that⁤ a woman had not been‍ chosen ‌to replace ⁢her,⁣ but would live to see‌ a record four women serving on the​ high court.\n\nPresident Barack Obama ⁤awarded O’Connor‍ the ‌Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor.\n\nShe ⁢died in ‍Phoenix of complications related to ⁣advanced dementia and ⁣a respiratory illness.⁣ Her survivors include a ⁣brother, ​three sons and ‍grandchildren.

She also has been diagnosed with schizoaffective‌ disorder, a condition sharing symptoms with ‍schizophrenia and‍ bipolar ‍disorder, according⁢ to court documents.\n\nTaylor told ABC’s “Good Morning America” in May that she⁤ feels responsible and ‍apologized to ​Zwerner.\n\n“That⁣ is my son, so I am, as a parent, obviously willing to take responsibility for him because he can’t ⁣take responsibility for​ himself,” Taylor‌ said.\n\nDuring her sentencing in‍ federal court last month, one of Taylor’s attorneys read⁤ aloud a brief statement in ⁤which Taylor said she would feel remorse “for the rest of my life.”\n\nThe bullet ⁤fired from Taylor’s gun struck Zwerner in the left hand and her upper left chest, breaking bones ‍and puncturing a lung. ⁣The teacher rushed her other students⁣ into the hallway before collapsing⁣ in ‍the school’s office.\n\nThe 6-year-old who ⁢shot Zwerner told a reading specialist who restrained him, ⁤”I shot that (expletive) dead,” and “I got my mom’s gun ​last night,” according to search warrants.\n\nZwerner told the⁢ judge ⁢during Taylor’s federal sentencing that she remembers losing consciousness while‌ medics ‍worked on her.\n\n“I was not ‌sure whether it would be my final moment on earth,” Zwerner ‍said.\n\nZwerner spent nearly two ⁢weeks in the hospital and has endured five ​surgeries​ to restore motion to her left hand. ‌She struggles to put on clothes or tie shoes.\n\nShe is suing Newport News Public Schools for $40 million, alleging administrators ignored multiple warnings ​the boy had a ‌gun.‌ She told the federal​ judge⁣ she has lost⁤ a sense of herself and⁤ suffered⁣ “massive financial loss.”\n\nZwerner no longer works for the school system and is no longer teaching. She said ‌she loves children but is now scared to work with them.\n\nShe attends therapy and⁤ has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, while also suffering from depression and anxiety.\n\n“I contend ‌daily with deep⁣ emotional scars,” Zwerner said.\n\nIt is important⁣ to ensure that firearms‌ are stored safely and ‌out of reach of children.

(Atlanta News First) - Atlanta’s Inspector General Shannon Manigault surprised the Atlanta City Council in appearing at Monday’s meeting making bold claims that city leaders have been interfering with investigations around corruption and abuse of power. “The reason I’m here today is because the Office of the Inspector General is facing an emergency. It’s not a hyperbole, that’s not an exaggeration in the slightest,” said Manigault. Manigault said the issues have been building but reached a new level when she found emails that showed city leaders obstructed recent investigations into corruption and abuse of power. She said people they interview are not only being informed that investigations were occurring but the subject of those investigations, including questions asked, was being improperly shared. “I think there have been attempts to leash the office, yes, I would say that,” Manigault said in an interview with Atlanta News First on Wednesday. “You can’t have any office of the inspector general (OIG) that’s denied access to city records, and city property, and city employees.” On Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Atlanta Mayor’s Office responded to Manigault’s claims. “The OIG has made serious allegations about unnamed individuals,” the spokesperson said. “From day one, the mayor has been crystal clear on the need for an ethical and efficient government and has always made himself available to the OIG at her request. We would love to know the names of the individuals who are being accused in order to address the issues being raised.” Manigault faced some backlash on Monday by two city council members. Councilwoman Andrea Boone said she’s been told by city employees that the Atlanta Office of the Inspector General is overstepping in how they’re conducting their investigations. “There’s something called the FBI if you think people are doing illegal activity,” said Boone. Boone said she’s heard reports that Manigault’s office is intercepting people’s CashApp transactions and showing up at people’s homes unannounced to conduct interviews. The Office of the Inspector General was established in 2020 by then-Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, following a federal corruption scandal involving Atlanta leaders. The Office said right now, they’re investigating 85 open cases involving allegations of corruption, abuse of power, fraud and waste. After one of the OIG’s most recent investigations, Dickens put Councilwoman Tarlesha Smith on administrative leave following abuse of power allegations surrounding Smith’s daughter’s employment with the city. In the report, the OIG alleged Smith “retaliated against her daughter’s supervisor and directed the personnel-related activities of another agency to benefit her immediate family member.” Manigault said since that report was published, other employees have come forward with similar claims of abuse of power. “Since the release of our report, we’ve heard from multiple city employees who have effectively said, ‘Me, too,’” Manigault said. Manigault said potential tweaks to legislation or the city charter could help clarify the office’s role and how it conducts investigations. She said she wants the public and city employees to feel empowered to file reports with the OIG. “I have to be hopeful. I’m really doing the work for the citizens of Atlanta,” Manigault said.

(Atlanta News First) - An Atlanta gynecologist was one of 13 people who pleaded guilty to running a “pill mill” in metro Atlanta, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia announced Wednesday. Anthony Mills, 57, was the group’s ringleader. He was sentenced to 11 years in prison and three years of supervised release for dispensing and distributing prescription controlled substances, the attorney’s office said Mills operated the mill out of his home since at least October 2018, issuing hundreds of illegal prescriptions for cash, according to the attorney’s office. Some of the buyer’s names were stolen identities, while others were the names of people who had died or were incarcerated. “Dr. Mills did not obtain prior medical records of his patients, conduct physical exams, or do anything to establish a valid patient-physician relationship,” the attorney’s office said. “Instead, he often issued prescriptions in the names of individuals he never met or evaluated.” Raphael Ogunsusi, a pharmacist at and the operator of Evansmill Pharmacy and Retox Pharmacy in Stonecrest and Conyers, then filled the prescriptions for hundreds of dollars in cash — including oxycodone for $900 and Percocet for $500. He falsely lowered the prices on the pharmacy’s computer records and made the customers buy other items, both to raise his profits and to hide the fact that most were only there to fill their illegal prescriptions, according to the attorney’s office. Ogunsusi pleaded guilty to conspiracy to dispense and distribute prescription controlled substances and money laundering. He was sentenced to nine years and seven months in prison, as well as one year of supervised release. The others sentenced include: Several agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and multiple sheriff’s offices and police departments across Georgia and South Carolina, helped investigate the case. “Pharmaceutical products that are distributed for non-medical reasons can be just as deadly as illicit drugs,” Robert J. Murphy, special agent in charge of Atlanta’s DEA division, said. “Dr. Mills distributed vast quantities of pharmaceutical products and had total disregard for human life. The moment he decided to illegally distribute drugs, he became nothing more than a drug trafficker.” Copyright 2024 WANF.

(Atlanta News First) - The Walmart in Vine City reopened Wednesday, more than a year after it closed because someone set a fire inside the store. Over the last year, Atlanta News First has spoken with people who live in the community around the store, and they’ve voiced how difficult it has been living in what they call a “food desert.” “This was essentially a food desert once this location closed, and so people had to go somewhere else to find groceries because we all got to eat,” Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said at the store’s reopening Wednesday. “So, food security is a huge issue, and my administration is dedicated to ensuring that all Atlantans, all residents in this city, no matter where they live, they have equitable access to fresh, affordable food options.” The former Walmart Supercenter closed in December 2022 after an arson. Now, the store has been converted into a massive neighborhood market. Officials say it’s the first of its kind. “It’s a wonderful feeling because I had been having to get a ride to go to Cleveland Avenue or Cascade,” said Priscilla McGhee, a shopper. “So, it’s a good feeling. I can walk up in here now. I had to get a ride, but now I don’t have to ride. I can still walk now like I had been walking.” The Vine City Civic Association holds a food distribution every Wednesday and Friday. Margaret Muhammad with the organization says they saw demand for their services triple after the Walmart closed. “Not only do we do this, a lot of times myself and some of the sisters I work with, we cook two or three times a month and we serve hot meals,” she said. The association worked with the city to help get the Walmart opened. Muhammad says the store’s reopening will help to address ongoing food disparities in Vine City. She added she doesn’t think it changes demand for services. “I don’t think it’s going to go away with today’s economy,” she said. “We expect to see just as many people because it is summer. The free food from school is no longer available. We’re here to serve the community.” The new store is 75,000 square feet — nearly double the size of a typical Walmart Neighborhood Market store. There’s a pharmacy, an expanded bakery, more produce, a new health service room and more. “As being a pharmacist and working in a pharmacy in general, we are that direct line of support for our patients,” said Mahlet Wole, pharmacy manager of Vine City Walmart Neighborhood Market. “We’re out in the community on a day-to-day basis, whether that be chronic medications, or they have acute issues that they need over-the-counter relief for. So, being back in a setting in a community where the need has been gone for so long, it’s very satisfying to know that we’re bridging that gap now back with the patients in this area.” Customers said this is a long time coming. “The change is great. I like it better than the last time, and plus, it’s a lot cleaner,” said Joanne Carter, another Walmart shopper. “I stay right up the street, so it’s in walking distance for me. So, this is more convenient. I had to pay quite a bit of money to get to Kroger and that’s like about 25 miles, 20 miles from here.” The reopening has also created 135 jobs. “We welcome you to a new beginning. A fresh start. A do-over,” said Byron Amos, Atlanta city councilman for District 3. “This is our story and we’re going to write it the way that we want. This is our commencement, which doesn’t mean the end. It actually means a new beginning.” For months, Amos and Dickens have worked with other officials to get the store back open again. On Wednesday, Dickens was the store’s first customer. “After I do interviews and stuff like that, I’m going shopping, y’all. I’m going shopping,” Dickens said. Walmart officials say it was so important to open back up to meet the needs of everyone in the community. “We are very excited to be back in the Vine City community,” said Alicia Anger, Walmart director of global communications. “For over a year, the store has been closed and this community has been suffering amid a food desert. They’ve lacked fresh food, fresh produce, and a pharmacy. So, for us to be back in this community means so much to the Walmart team.” Dickens said the Atlanta Police Department will have a touch station at the reopened store so police can stay in this area. The public was invited to the event, which featured a live DJ, Coca-Cola’s polar bears, Tony the Tiger, and free samples from several snack companies, such as Frito Lay, Nestle and Pepperidge Farm.

(Atlanta News First) - A glitch in Georgia’s voter information page that lasted just shy of an hour during Tuesday’s primary election has some advocates concerned for the November general election. The My Voter Page, referred to as MVP, is a site run by the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office that allows voters to look up their registration status and precinct location, and track their absentee ballots and view sample ballots. But for about an hour between 1-2 p.m. during Tuesday’s primary, the site was down, leaving voters with no access to their information. “In the years I’ve been doing this I’ve never seen it be down for this long,” said Stephanie Ali, policy director with the voting rights group New Georgia Project. “So we have to have our confidence that this is getting fixed, that this is going to be stronger and that this is going to handle a higher volume going into November and frankly beyond.” Election officials said the crash was a symptom of too much traffic on the page – or more accurately – what those users were doing. “It’s not just the user, it’s the things they’re requesting,” said Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer of the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office, in a press conference moments after the site went back online. “When you’re requesting to download a sample ballot, it’s a lot more capacity than it is if you’re just looking at your polling location, so it’s not a question of number of users. We were in the thousands at a time of doing it at that point.” But primary elections historically see far lower voter turnout than general elections, so the concern is that the site will experience something similar when far more voters are using it in November. “If this number of voters knocks it off its pedestal, then we’ve got to expect a higher number are coming and we’ve got to be ready for that,” said Ali. Exacerbating the issue were ongoing delays at U.S. Postal Offices in Georgia. Because those delays risked the timely delivery of absentee ballots, absentee voters were specifically encouraged to check the MVP for the status of their ballot, and if it wasn’t showing a confirmed delivery, they were directed to vote in person so their absentee ballot could be spoiled once it arrived late. The page was needed Tuesday perhaps more than it had been in a long time. This year’s primary election was the first since a sweeping round of redistricting impacted the voting precincts and candidates for people in metro Atlanta and the metro Macon area. It also happened in the middle of the day, when people still had a chance to confirm their precinct and go vote. Ali said it could have been far worse. “Our biggest fear seeing something like that is that that sort of crash happens in the evening at 6 p.m. when people are trying to do their final runs and there is no later,” she said. “You can’t just have a flippant response that, oh, there’s still a chance, because at some point there won’t be.” The site was back up and running around 2 p.m. on Tuesday. Georgia saw a roughly 20% voter turnout for the primary. Copyright 2024 WANF.

That didn’t stop him from getting his degree from Clark Atlanta University this spring or charting a career path that might seem daunting, even to those with perfect vision. “There’s nothing you can do about it, so you just have to play the cards you’re dealt,” he said. To accomplish his goal, Robinson uses technology to his advantage. “So, what I like to do is inverted colors because I can’t read black on white, only white on black,” he said, showing how to change color schemes on a laptop. Even with 20/600 vision, he reads as fast as anyone else using the magnifying feature on his mouse. He also uses a Visiobook, a piece of technology that alters colors and magnifies text on physical books while transferring it to a screen. “It took about eight years for me to get a personal one,” he explained. It’s a necessary item for studying that costs thousands of dollars. “Coming from the [inner-city Philadelphia], it was extremely expensive,” Robinson said. Robinson has a few weeks to relax before heading to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle for a summer internship.

(Atlanta News First) - A Sandy Springs law firm says it plans to file lawsuits against a group of public schools on allegations that they violated Title IX rights. Personal injury lawyers at Isenberg & Hewitt, PC allege violations happened across Carroll, DeKalb, Douglas, Gwinnett and Washington counties. Title IX protects individuals from discrimination in educational programs based on their sex. The civil rights law also offers protections against instances of sexual abuse, assault, coercion and hazing, the law firm said. The firm held a news conference Wednesday to discuss several cases of situations between students and between teachers and students. “It’s our position, in all these cases, that these schools have been deliberately indifferent to a dangerous condition or dangerous actor. They knew of, should have known of, and failed to properly respond,” attorney Mel Hewitt said. Atlanta News First reached out to the five county school districts the law firm announced they planned on filing lawsuits against. Several of the districts responded. Gwinnett County Public Schools said, “Given the possibility of future legal action against Gwinnett County Public Schools, on the advice of our attorneys, the district has no comment at this time.” The DeKalb County School District said it’s the longstanding practice of the district “not to comment on potential or pending litigation.” WATCH THE NEWS CONFERENCE HERE: Last week, the National Women’s Law Center (NWLC) filed complaints against the Cobb County School District claiming school officials violated Title IX and Title VI through censorship of books that “feature, tell the stories of, or are written by LGBTQIA+ people and people of color.” Copyright 2024 WANF.

(Atlanta News First) - According to the National Institute of Medicine, pre-eclampsia is a potentially serious condition affecting up to 5% of pregnancies, most frequently after 20 weeks’ gestation. Pre-eclampsia can cause high blood pressure in pregnant women and eventually lead to seizures and higher risk of high blood pressure, strokes and heart disease later in life. The condition can be detected by testing a pregnant woman’s blood and organs. In Georgia, pre-eclampsia is one of the leading causes of death for pregnant women. Director of the Regional Prenatal Center at Wellstar Medical College of Georgia Health Center Dr. Padmashree Chaudhury Woodham said prognostic biomarker testing can help a doctor decide the best possible outcome for their patient. “This test is based on the levels of the biomarkers that can help the provider really determine whether the patient needs to be inpatient or outpatient, right? Do they need to stay in the hospital until their delivery or can they go home,” said Woodham. Woodham applauds the state for providing more resources and funding to increase survival rates for pregnant women. She said the state put more than $250,000 in the budget this year and there is also a federal match. According to the CDC, black women are up to five times more likely to get preeclampsia. Dr Woodham urges women to bring the test up to their providers because it’s so new. In 2023, the FDA approved the preeclampsia biomarker test. “This is actually a test that’s been run in Europe for over a decade, but in the US we rolled this out only a few months ago. And as a result, insurance companies haven’t picked up on this quite yet,” said Woodham. More than half of the counties in Georgia are maternal care deserts. Woodham said this funding is crucial to improving maternal outcomes in the state. According to the CDC, Georgia had the seventh-highest rate of maternal deaths in the nation from 2018 to 2021. “This is going to improve the rates In terms of lower hospitalization, hopefully, over the next few years, we’ll see lower rates of mortality as well as morbidity,” said Woodham.

(Atlanta News First) - Air travel remains one of the safest modes of transportation, but when a plane does crash, who is really investigating what happened? It’s supposed to be the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), but sometimes the agency doesn’t show up. Atlanta News First Investigates found nearly a dozen fatal crashes throughout Georgia where NTSB investigators stayed home, including a 2020 crash in Putnam County. In Georgia, the NTSB doesn’t respond to fatal events 16% of the time. Full investigation from our partners at InvestigateTV: (InvestigateTV) — Just 19 minutes after Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 departed, a door plug behind the aircraft’s left wing suddenly blew out, causing rapid decompression in the cabin. By the time the plane made an emergency landing and limped back to a gate — the event leaving the 171 passengers and six crewmembers shaken but alive — the wheels of the investigation into what went wrong were likely already in motion. By law, the National Transportation Safety Board is to be notified immediately of any event involving civil aircraft in the United States, as the agency is tasked with investigating all such incidents and accidents to determine what happened and if there are ways to prevent it from happening again. NTSB investigators were on the ground in Portland, Oregon and examining the Boeing 737 Max-9 in less than 22 hours. But such a presence is not seen in the case of every aviation event — NTSB investigators are often absent from the scenes of crashes involving small aircraft, even when there is a loss of life. InvestigateTV analysis of NTSB records found the agency only travels to a small fraction of all investigations each year, and over the last several years has left the on-scene work in the hands of the Federal Aviation Administration or others for roughly 1 in 5 fatal crashes. During periods of difficulty, such as a federal government shutdown or the COVID-19 pandemic, the agency’s in-person presence has been even more limited. Board documents indicate NTSB officials weigh a variety of factors when deciding where to go and when — some of them seemingly more focused on public perception than the severity of a crash: Will there be media coverage? Was a celebrity on board? An excerpt from the NTSB’s regional investigation manual explaining the decision making process for the agency’s level of response to an aircraft event. (Source: NTSB, Graphic by InvestigateTV) But NTSB officials assert priority is given to those events that would likely result in industry-wide safety recommendations. They also have to wrestle with responding to more than 1,200 aviation events each year with an investigative staff of less than 100 and a budget that has remained relatively flat since the late 1990s. Still, critics say not responding in person, especially to fatal crashes, threatens the independence of the NTSB. It was specifically designed by Congress to operate outside of the U.S. Department of Transportation to catch any safety issues or gaps in policy that could put the public at risk. “There needs to be a very strong and strict firewall between the agency and the investigator, especially now when you have more cases of doors flying off and problems with planes,” said David Williams, president of Taxpayers Protection Alliance, a nonprofit that looks at government spending, transparency and efficiency. The Alaska Airlines event in particular has reignited criticisms of the FAA’s own practice of outsourcing certain safety inspections to manufacturers themselves, but Williams and others say regardless of how things are going for that entity, the NTSB’s efforts should stand on their own. “Consumers expect from the NTSB that they are independent, that they are separate from the FAA,” Williams said, “and it’s critical for consumers, for taxpayers and just for the flying safety of the public.” It’s especially critical for the loved ones of those who are killed when something goes wrong between takeoff and landing. ‘I was horrified that they weren’t coming’ One crash that lacked an on-scene NTSB presence occurred on October 2, 2020, when the small plane piloted by prominent personal injury attorney Steve Barnes plunged to the earth about 17 miles short of its destination at the Buffalo, New York airport. Barnes’ partner of 12 years, Ellen Sturm, was in the middle of preparing for a family party when she learned the person who meant the world to her was gone. “He was everything to me,” she said. “I worked side by side with him. We climbed mountains together. We had family functions together. We were best friends in every sense.” The plane crash also took the life of Barnes’s niece, Elizabeth Barnes, whom he was retrieving from New Hampshire so she could attend the small, pandemic-conscious celebration of Steve’s mother’s 90th birthday.

(Courtesy of Ellen Sturm) When he left for the round trip that was scheduled to take only a few hours, Sturm said he was excited about the chance to spend time with the family. “He walked out, he said, ‘I love you. I’ll be home before noon with Lizzie,’” she said. Normally, Sturm said Barnes would text her after landing and give her updates, but when she hadn’t heard from him by about 12:30 p.m., she said she began messaging him to ask where he was. As she was preparing the meal for the ill-fated party, Sturm said she received a frantic phone call from her brother, a journalist. “When I picked up my cell phone, my brother was like, ‘Ellen — you’re okay,’ and I just knew from his voice and I said, ‘What’s going on?’ and he just said, ‘Don’t turn the news on,’” she recalled. Instead of a joyful celebration, the family was left planning two funerals. “I don’t know if anybody can really appreciate how cruel fate can be that you would live until your 90th birthday and lose your son and your granddaughter on that day,” Sturm said. As Sturm mourned, authorities combed through the accident scene. But one entity was noticeably absent — the NTSB. The final report reviewed by InvestigateTV does not explain why the crash did not merit an on-scene response, but the agency told news outlets at the time it was due to limitations caused by the pandemic. “I was horrified that they weren’t coming and doing a full investigation,” Sturm said. Even calls by members of Congress for the NTSB to send an investigator on-site were left unheeded. “It just it felt like you’re completely diminished at the worst time of your life,” Sturm said. “There’s these two incredible people and they’re just wiped off the planet, and isn’t this the organization that’s supposed to be in charge of, you know, airplane safety, aviation safety?” ‘Independence’ and a key decision: To go, or not to go? By the numbers, air travel has consistently retained its status over time as the “safest” form of getting from one place to another. Still, aviators dating back to the Wright brothers note there is always a risk that something will go wrong between takeoff and landing, the elder brother Wilbur remarking in 1901: “If you are looking for perfect safety, you will do well to sit on a fence and watch the birds.” There are an average of three aviation incidents or accidents in the U.S. per day, the vast majority involving small, non-commercial aircraft, and fatal crashes occur roughly once every two days. For every single one of those events, the NTSB is required by law to investigate in order to determine the probable cause and whether any safety recommendations need to be made to the industry or regulators. Those investigations are meant to be done independently — meaning they are supposed to be done outside of the control of any other federal department. An excerpt from the 1974 Independent Safety Board Act (Pub. L. 93−633) outlining the purpose of the NTSB’s independent status. (Source: GovInfo.gov; Graphic by InvestigateTV) The NTSB was first created in 1967 as part of the U.S. Department of Transportation, but in 1974 was pulled out and re-established by Congress as a separate, independent entity charged with promoting safety in transportation by conducting investigations and making safety recommendations. The law says that because the NTSB may need to make critical or adverse conclusions about DOT operations or policies and suggest changes, it had to be independent. “No federal agency can properly perform such functions unless it is totally separate and independent from any other,” the statute reads. The law states that the NTSB is “responsible for the investigation, determination of facts, conditions, and circumstances and the cause or probable cause of all accidents involving civil aircraft, and certain public aircraft.” And while other federal, state or local agencies may be granted access to crash sites and evidence, the NTSB retains control and primary jurisdiction. Events involving other modes of transportation — automobiles, railroads, pipelines and marine vessels — also fall under the agency’s purview, but the statute does not mandate “all” accidents be investigated in the same way that it does for aviation. “Our job is to go out and to determine the facts, conditions and circumstances of each accident,” Joe Sedor, the chief technical advisor for the NTSB’s Office of Aviation Safety, said in an interview with InvestigateTV. InvestigateTV analysis of NTSB investigation data from 2015-2023 found the agency initially designated an average of just 14.1% of all aviation investigations each year merited having NTSB staff at the scene. In a majority of aviation events each of those years — roughly 70% — no one was hurt or there were only minor injuries, but the U.S. saw, on average, 215 fatal crashes annually. Because the scope of the NTSB’s response could potentially expand or contract after a crash’s initial categorization is made, InvestigateTV and the Arnolt Center for Investigative Reporting reviewed the published investigation reports for all fatal events across 2015-2023 to determine whether an agency investigator traveled to the scene or not. According to the data, on average the NTSB did not travel to the scene of at least 21.8% of fatal events each year. That figure includes 2020, when the agency opted not to travel to 77.3% of fatal events, including the one outside of Buffalo that killed Steve Barnes and his niece, citing pandemic restrictions on travel — even though guidance for federal employees allowed for “mission critical” travel, including for safety investigations. InvestigateTV presented the NTSB with a list of multiple fatal events where it did not send an investigator to the scene, including several that occurred outside of the pandemic timeframe, but the agency did not provide answers about what circumstances influenced those specific decisions. According to an agency spokesperson, as well as an NTSB investigation manual found by InvestigateTV, the list of things the agency considers when deciding whether to send investigators to the scene includes: “We look at each accident individually, because every accident is different,” Sedor said. “Even if it has similar circumstances there, it’s going to have its own unique aspects.” The NTSB as a whole has roughly 430 employees, and Sedor said the aviation office makes up about 120 of that total. With a yearly load of investigations that outnumbers staff 10-to-1, Sedor said it’s often necessary to utilize outside resources though what’s called the “party system,” where the on-scene work is handled by other entities. By law, the FAA is always granted status as a party, and aircraft manufacturers, state and local law enforcement and other subject matter experts also may provide assistance. But even in cases where those parties are at the scene and the NTSB is not, Sedor said the agency still retains official control of the process. “We do not delegate the investigation,” Sedor said. Parties must sign a document acknowledging their responsibility to cooperate with NTSB investigators and follow agency policy and that they are prohibited from withholding any information they obtain during the investigation from the NTSB. However, a 2000 study by the RAND Corporation, a nonpartisan policy research group, found while the party system works well enough in most cases, it has the potential to be compromised by the inherent tension between the NTSB and the FAA or the risk of civil litigation. “This inherent conflict of interest may jeopardize, or be perceived to jeopardize, the integrity of the NTSB investigation,” the study report states. Throughout his career spanning half a century, including almost a decade as an NTSB board member, John Goglia participated in countless aviation crash investigations — including the catastrophic TWA-800 explosion in 1996 that sent an airplane bound for Paris into the Atlantic Ocean. Now, he offers his expertise in other ways, including through a flight safety podcast he started with other aviation experts where they discuss crash investigations and their takeaways. Goglia said he believes the NTSB risks missing potentially critical details about what led to a crash when they don’t have an on-scene presence during an investigation. “We often say [on the podcast] that the NTSB hit the big red easy button for some of the probable causes just to just to move it along,” he said. Goglia said he takes issue with the inherent assertion that on-scene efforts by the FAA are equivalent to what would be done by an NTSB investigator. In order to participate on-scene in the NTSB’s shoes, FAA employees must at minimum be employed at the Aviation Safety Inspector level and have taken the “Basic Aircraft Accident Investigation” course at the NSTB’s Transportation Safety Institute in Oklahoma City, according to an agreement between the two entities,. FAA employees are then required to take subsequent courses “as soon as practicable.” Excerpts from an FAA document outlining the training requirements for personnel who participate in accident investigations. (Source: FAA document; Graphic by InvestigateTV) By contrast, the minimum job requirements listed in a job posting for an NTSB Investigator are much higher, including having specialized experience leading or participating in multiple complex accident investigations. “It’s a disservice to the American public because we don’t get all the benefits for the money that we’re spending for these investigations to bring the improvements,” he said. Even though the FAA may share a similar goal of aviation safety with the NTSB, Williams with Taxpayers Protection Alliance said he too views the significant use of FAA personnel during the early stages of a crash investigation as a weakening of the NTSB independence taxpayers are supposedly paying for. “An independent watchdog like the NTSB, has to be the lead investigator in this,” Williams said. “That’s why they need people on the scene.” Like Goglia, Williams also said he had concerns about the training level of FAA investigators, and the two aren’t alone — the Government Accountability Office found gaps in the training practices in the FAA’s Office of Aviation Safety. The 2020 report notes that while the agency provides training, it does not have processes in place to identify if its employees possess the critical competencies needed to carry out their jobs, nor does it regularly evaluate if its training curriculum is sufficient — something that Williams says only further emphasizes the need for NTSB investigators to be on-scene. “There is no assurance that when FAA personnel go to a crash investigation, that they’re the right personnel to do this,” he said. “The NTSB is trained specifically for these situations and to investigate these situations.” ‘Undetermined reasons’ Despite taking the better part of two years, the investigation into the crash that killed Steve Barnes and his niece never found a definitive reason the single-engine aircraft seemingly fell from the sky. “I still don’t feel like I know, and I know that the rest of the family feels like they don’t know,” Ellen Sturm, Barnes’s partner, said. According to the final NTSB report, investigators found no evidence of any structural or mechanical failures that would have affected the aircrafts normal operations, and meteorological data reflect that the crash area was experiencing mostly clear skies with no concern for ice or turbulence. The only apparent anomaly was a 25-minute lapse in contact between the aircraft and Air Traffic Control — but tower controllers were able to communicate with Barnes as he prepared to land. The controller asked, “Is everything okay?” to which Barnes replied, “Yes sir, everything is fine.” Based on a performance study done using data the FAA and the plane’s manufacturer, NTSB investigators determined that shortly after that response, the aircraft entered into a severe spiral dive toward the earth where it made impact, creating a 15-foot-deep crater. The official probable cause determined by the NTSB for the October 2, 2020 crash is documented as: “The pilot’s failure to maintain control of the airplane for undetermined reasons during the descent to the destination airport.” Ellen Sturm with her late partner, Steve Barnes. Sturm said they loved adventure and frequently flew together in the plane that was housed near the home the couple shared in Buffalo, New York. (Courtesy of Ellen Sturm) Sturm said she remains beyond unsatisfied with the ultimate findings — especially because the NTSB did not have an investigator on scene. “[Concluding] ‘He didn’t control the plane coming down for unknown reasons,’ that’s not helpful. Not really,” she said. “There could have been something mechanically wrong with the plane. I mean, they determined there wasn’t, but they didn’t bother to come and look at the evidence.” NTSB staff did take a look at the recovered pieces of wreckage about six weeks after the crash, but Sturm said investigators should have been the ones to recover it in the first place. “I think that they should have been there combing through that. They knew what to look for,” she said. She said she believes it’s possible something could have been missed or mishandled. “The data that was collected on scene and then the data afterwards — I believe that we determined the probable cause just as if we had been on scene, so we did not lose any information in that aspect,” Sedor, with the NTSB, said. The day following the crash, when it became clear the NTSB was not planning to send an investigator to the scene, two New York Congressional representatives sent a letter to then-chair Robert Sumwalt, copying FAA administrator Steve Dickson. Rep. Chris Jacobs (R) and Rep. Brian Higgins (D) implored the NTSB to travel to the site of the crash, saying: “Neglecting to do so leaves crucial information about what caused this tragic crash unknown.” The NTSB told news outlets at the time “the decision to not travel to the scene included assessment of COVID-19 risks,” but the Associated Press confirmed the agency received the letter from the lawmakers. NTSB records show investigators did launch to a fatal crash in Alabama five days after the crash that killed Barnes and his niece, and there were five other accidents that month labeled as “field” level investigations but that didn’t specifically indicate in the report whether the agency traveled to the scene. “We did send people out when we needed to, but that’s again, [the pandemic] was just one more thing we had to think about,” Sedor said. The NTSB hired 57 new employees in fiscal year 2023, bringing it to a total of about 430, and current board chair Jennifer Homendy has said the agency is hoping to hire roughly 15 additional new employees through 2027. “It is critical for the agency to have additional resources to respond to events without impacting timeliness, quality, and our independence,” Homendy said in April 2022, when she first presented the agency’s budget requests to lawmakers. On April 29, lawmakers announced a bipartisan agreement on language reauthorizing both the FAA and the NTSB that would give the independent agency $738 million over five years. That bill was approved by the Senate on May 9, and is awaiting action in the House. But Homendy has also told lawmakers that to completely right-size the agency would take significantly more employees. InvestigateTV contacted several lawmakers involved in aviation oversight —including House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chair Rep. Sam Graves (R-MO) and ranking member Rep. Rick Larsen (D-WA), as well as aviation subcommittee chair Rep. Garrett Graves (R-LA) and committee member Del. Eleanor Holmes-Norton (D-DC) — to ask about the NTSB’s level of on-scene response to aviation crashes and its resource needs, but none were available for interviews. Multiple requests for comment were sent to Rep. Brian Higgins, one of the lawmakers who urged the NTSB to respond to the Barnes crash, before he left office in February, but InvestigateTV did not receive a response. Meanwhile, there have also been calls for the NTSB to better use the resources it does have. In August 2023, a GAO report found while the NTSB has been working in recent years to improve its processes, there is more that needs to be done. “The more efficiently they use those resources, the better they can deliver on those missions,” said Heather Krause, managing director of GAO’s physical infrastructure team and lead author of the report. “Identifying inefficiencies is key. It could save lives. It could make the difference between finding safety flaws and not finding them.” Yang Chao, Runtian Huang, Carson Johnson, Brookelyn Lambright, Yanai Levy, Martin Schauss, Tyler Spence and Jacob Spudich from the Arnolt Center for Investigative Reporting provided research assistance for this report. Research Methodology: InvestigateTV and the Arnolt Center for Investigative Reporting downloaded aviation event data from the NTSB’s CAROL database for all aviation events in the United States from Jan. 1, 2015, through Dec. 31, 2023. NTSB training presentations and the documentation for the agency’s accident information database notes the identification number assigned to each investigation details the level of initial agency response using a two-letter identifier: By isolating those identifiers, InvestigateTV was able to determine the initial level of agency response for each event. Looking at events where there was at least one fatality to determine whether or not an NTSB investigator traveled to the scene of an event, InvestigateTV and Arnolt Center researchers reviewed the PDF reports published in the CAROL database. The “Administrative Information” section generally includes notation about the level of on-scene response. Reports were marked “Yes” if the document explicitly noted the NTSB traveled to the scene, “No” if the report explicitly noted the NTSB did not travel to the scene, or “Unclear” if there was no note about on-scene presence or the note was not specific. Calculations regarding the NTSB’s absence from a scene include only those events where the “No” was explicitly noted.

(Atlanta News First) - The next congressman from Georgia will likely be decided on June 18, as will the CEO of the state’s fourth-largest county, now that voters have cast their ballots in the May 21 primary. Most of November’s races have been set in what will be Georgia’s nationally watched presidential vote. But here are three congressional and metro Atlanta races that have major implications for the Peach State: Michael Thurmond has had one of Georgia’s most accomplished political careers in recent memory: former state representative, former Georgia commissioner of labor, former DeKalb County schools superintendent, and now, soon-to-be-former county CEO. Thurmond is leaving behind big shoes to fill, and Lorraine Cochran-Johnson and Larry Johnson are vying to step into them. Both made Tuesday’s runoff, leaving behind Steve Bradshaw in third place. U.S. Rep. Drew Ferguson apparently decided he’d had enough of the hustle and bustle (not to mention any other shenanigans) of Capitol Hill when he announced last December he was retiring. The west-central Georgia district — which includes most of metro Atlanta’s southern suburbs and stretches southwestward to portions of Columbus — is heavily Republican, meaning whoever wins the Brian Jack-Mike Dugan runoff is a strong favorite to become the Peach State’s next congressman. Jack is a former Donald Trump advisor, and the nation’s 45th president has already made a very public endorsement of his candidacy. Jack finished first in Tuesday’s primary, and at one point was well above the 50%-plus-one margin to win the election outright. But Dugan, an outgoing state senator from Carrollton and a former Senate majority leader, gained enough votes to make the runoff. Clarence Blalock and Shawn Harris will face each other in a runoff for the Democratic nomination for the 14th congressional. Blalock and Harris are trying to earn the unenviable task of running against one of the nation’s highest-profile Republican congressional officials. Incumbent Republican U.S. Rep.

Scarbrough to build the northern segment of the PATH 400 greenway, a 5.2-mile walkable, bikeable trail being constructed along the highway. The segment will extend from Loridans Drive to the southern part of Sandy Springs inside the perimeter, according to the city council. Available funding will cover construction of two sections of the northern segment within Sandy Springs city limits, totaling 1.8 miles of the planned 2.3-mile segment, county officials said. One section will stretch from Nancy Creek to Windsor Parkway. The other will stretch from Ridgeview Park to north of the Glenridge Connector, connecting with a section of the trail constructed as part of the Transform 285/400 project.

(Atlanta News First) - When Georgia state lawmakers debated a proposed law back in 2018 about granting cities the authority to install speed detection cameras in school zones, the bill’s author pulled at his colleagues’ heartstrings. “We’ve had several deaths and major injuries in the state of Georgia already in these school zones,” said then-state Rep. Chad Nimmer, a Republican from Blackshear, during a state House public safety and homeland security committee hearing. “And if they think surveillance technology is the right way to protect their children and their memaws and peepaws and mommies and daddies and the cross-walk tenants safe, they can install this if they deem necessary.” The committee chairman called it a “good bill.” Lawmakers passed it with little discussion. Nearly five years later, an Atlanta News First Investigation has uncovered the cameras have exploded in use, generating millions in revenue for cities across the state. In 2019, the Georgia Department of Transportation approved 39 camera permits. Last year, there were 290 approved permits. Public records from 54 Georgia municipalities reveal the cameras have generated more than $112 million in revenue since 2019, an amount that has some lawmakers and city leaders questioning the real motivation of the cameras. According to the same public records, camera operators issued at least 2,484,260 citations from 2019 to March 2023. That’s 1,269 tickets a day in Georgia. The revenue and citation numbers identified by Atlanta News First Investigates is a conservative tally because not all Georgia municipalities responded to public record requests seeking the information. Atlanta News First Investigates also did not send record requests to every municipality using the cameras, although our findings include most large cities and counties operating the surveillance technology. School zone camera citations typically run about $100 a ticket, but it can increase if drivers don’t pay it on time. While the citations are not criminal and do not impact a driver’s license, the Georgia Department of Revenue can withhold vehicle registrations if citations are unpaid. No other city in Georgia has collected more revenue from camera citations than the city of South Fulton: $14.1 million. Contact ANF Investigative Reporter Andy Pierrotti at andy.pierrotti@wanf.com. City records show it’s used the money to buy tasers, uniforms, computers, vehicle repairs, and a armed vehicle which cost $359,000. State law mandates the revenue can only be used for public safety purposes. South Fulton Mayor khalid kamau doesn’t believe the cameras make school zones safter. “We can see year by year, the amount of money we’re generating is increasing. So, that tells me that it doesn’t work,” kamau said. Kamau said the money should be used strictly for pedestrian safety. He said the city council recently approved plans to use about 25% of its camera citation revenue to install speed bumps, which he believes work better than cameras. “The different between traffic cameras and speed bumps is that one costs money, and one makes money,” kamau said, calling camera revenue “taxation through citation.” The mayor cannot ban the cameras himself because South Fulton’s government establishes policy through city council members and is run by a city manager. “The buck doesn’t stop with me,” kamau said. “If it did, I would void the contract. I would cancel the cameras. I would take all the $14 million and use it exclusively on pedestrian safety.” South Fulton Chief of Police Keith Meadows disagrees with the mayor. He believes the cameras have made the community safter. “These ordinances significantly improve our ability to protect the community, respond to emergencies, and ensure safer streets for our residents,” Meadows said. “The investment in traffic calming measures also plays a crucial role in reducing speeding and preventing accidents in residential areas, making South Fulton a safer place for everyone.” Nearly a month ago, Atlanta News First Investigates asked Meadows for evidence showing the cameras have made city roads safter. Neither he or his staff have responded. Meadows said since the cameras have been installed, there have been no pedestrian facilities in school zones, but admits the police department has not conducted a comprehensive review of traffic patterns since the city started using the technology. After the law went into effect, some Georgia police departments posted social media videos emphasizing the cameras were all about safety. A video posted on Henry County Police Department’s Facebook page includes a puppet named “Officer Steve” talking to adult drivers about the importance of slowing down in school zones. “It’s not safe. Stop it,” said the puppet. “And so we’re going to start enforcing it with cameras.” One of the camera operators appears to have produced social media videos for Georgia law enforcement agencies, with officers reading nearly identical scripts. “A study conducted by the Governor’s Highway Safety Association showed that between 2008 and 2017 there was a 35 % increase in pedestrian facilities throughout the United States,” said two different officers from separate agencies in videos posted on the Roswell Police Department and the Albany Police Departments’ Facebook pages. Roswell officials confirmed the camera operator helped produce its video. Albany officials did not respond to repeated requests for confirmation. According to the National Highway Safety Administration, Georgia pedestrian fatalities steadily increased since the cameras were approved. While the agency does not break down fatality numbers by community or school zone, it shows pedestrian facilities rose from 262 in 2019 to 345 in 2022, the most available year available. That’s a 31% increase. The number of school-aged children pedestrian deaths have nearly unchanged year to year. The vast majority of Georgia’s pedestrian fatalities happened at night when school is not in session. “Let’s cut to the chase. It is about money,” said state Rep. Clay Pirkle (R-Ashburn). “It’s like having your own personal ATM machine.” After receiving multiple complaints about the cameras, Pirkle filed a bill this past legislative session to ban the cameras. It failed to pass. Over the past year, Georgia municipalities have identified problems with the cameras and the signs intended to notify drivers they were entering a school zone enforced by the surveillance technology. The city of Jonesboro recently refunded drivers $76,400 after it issued tickets for the wrong speed limit. Barrow County officials refunded drivers $721,125.90 after posting a school zone speed limit sign in the wrong location. Last year, a law firm in Augusta filed class action lawsuits against two camera companies that operate in Georgia. One of the lawsuits focuses on Blue Line Solutions, a company which operates the school zone cameras for the town of Tallulah Falls, a municipality that surrounds Tallulah Gorge, a popular state park 90 miles northeast of Atlanta that has heavy traffic during the summer. The complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Georgia accused the company of “collecting unauthorized revenue” and “excessive electronic processing fees.” A judge dismissed the claims earlier this year, but the plaintiff’s attorney says he plans to refile soon. An attorney representing Blue Line Solutions declined to respond to the lawsuit’s claims. “I feel like the government is in my pocket and they’re doing it deceptively,” said Gary Klingman, who received a ticket in December 2023 from Blue Line after driving through the school zone near Tallulah Falls. “It shouldn’t be allowed,” The ticket - which included a picture of his vehicle and license plate - shows Klingman driving 57 miles an hour in a 45-mile-per-hour school zone. The sign warning drivers they are entering the town’s school zone clearly reads its enforced when the lights are flashing. But Klingman received his ticket when the lights were off. Town officials told him the cameras ticket drivers almost all day and pointed him to its website, which shows enforcement runs from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. The sign’s warning lights turn off at 8 a.m. Klingman, a retired teacher, was ticketed nearly an hour and a half later. Since Tallulah Falls started using the cameras, town records show it’s collected more than $3 million in citation revenue so far. It’s used the money to purchase a new Chevrolet Tahoe for its police department and a $24,000 drone to help find injured or lost hikers. Documents provided by the municipal clerk show also show Mayor Mike Early has expressed interest in using the citation revenue to hire two more public safety employees. A U.S. Census survey in 2022 shows the town’s population is about 200 residents. “Why should I and all the other people who are driving through here have to pay to subsidize the town of Tallulah Falls?” asked Klingman. Early did not respond to questions submitted by email about Klingman’s concerns with the cameras. Pirkle isn’t seeking re-election, but he said he knows many state lawmakers who want to re-file his legislation to ban the cameras next year. “It is a huge tax to working people that get zero benefit of this,” he said.

(Atlanta News First) - In the wake of a recent off-road vehicle accident that left two teens dead and three others injured in south Georgia, Atlanta News First Investigates has found a staggering surge in deadly crashes involving kids and all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). Multiple vigils were held last week for Jayden Copeland, 14, and Madison McDonald, 16, who were killed when, according to officials, they were riding a side-by-side and pulled out in front of a pickup truck in Thomas County. Currently, Georgia does not ban children under 16 from driving ATVs, despite federal guidance to set age limits. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission says most ATVs are designed for one rider. Riders younger than 16 should only drive age-appropriate youth model ATVs, and never adult ATVs. Off-road vehicles are designed to be driven only on off-road terrain, not paved surfaces. It also advises never to ride on public roads except to cross where permitted by law. Over a three-year period, 66 people were killed on utility task vehicles (UTVs) and ATVs in Georgia. The state requires drivers to be 16 or older only when operating those vehicles on open roads, but not on private property. Full investigation from our partners at InvestigateTV: (InvestigateTV) — Kate Bruggenschmidt was 11 years old and weighed just 75 pounds when she climbed atop a 750-pound ATV for a joy ride with a friend. It was the first – and final time – that Kate would drive an all-terrain vehicle. She and her friend both were fatally injured when the ATV tipped. Neither was wearing a helmet. And neither, safety advocates say, was mature enough to handle the complexities of a massive machine. No other product regulated by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has as many injuries and fatalities tied to it as ATVs – and the CPSC oversees some 15,000 categories of largely everyday-use items such as coffee pots, televisions, and toys. Every year, according to estimates from the CPSC, ATVs are responsible for more than 100,000 trips to emergency rooms across the country. But ATVs pose a particular issue for federal oversight because state and local jurisdictions often dictate the age of riders and the safety requirements needed. That has created a patchwork of regulation that leaves consumers vulnerable, according to an InvestigateTV analysis of federal data and state laws. Kate’s mother, Ashlee Bruggenschmidt, soon learned that her home state of Indiana did not require that ATV riders wear helmets until after her daughter’s death on July 26, 2015. That morning, her 11-year-old daughter Kate, a shy, straight-A student and an avid softball player, asked to go over to her teammate’s house in between games. The plan thrilled both Bruggenschmidt and her husband. “She was going to middle school into sixth grade, so we were happy that she was kind of branching out a little bit and wanting to go to a friend’s house. But little did we know we would send her to a friend’s house, and she would never come back,” Bruggneschmidt said. Bruggneschmidt received a call no parent can prepare for. “I thought she had been in a car accident,” Bruggenschmidt said. “An ATV crash never crossed my mind – we had no idea that she was riding an ATV or anything like that.” Kate was driving an adult-sized ATV with one of her teammates on the back. Neither were wearing helmets. The ATV tipped over, and while the teammate had enough time to jump off the back, Kate did not. She was killed instantly. “She was on an adult-size ATV wearing no safety gear,” Bruggenschmidt said. Bruggenschmidt didn’t know her daughter Kate would ever be on an ATV, much less driving one. “ATVs were not our lifestyle. She was very, very, inexperienced. She had never driven an ATV before,” Bruggenschmidt said. That crash changed the Bruggenschmidts’ lives forever. Following Kate’s death, her mother fought to change Indiana’s off-road vehicle child helmet law. As of 2017, the state requires all children under 18 to wear a helmet while riding or driving ATVs on public and private lands. Anyone breaking the helmet law can be charged with a misdemeanor violation and a penalty of $500. ATV laws across the country vary from state to state The Consumer Product Safety Commission, or CPSC, first began regulating all-terrain vehicles in the 1980s. The federal agency was tasked alongside ATV industry leaders with creating both voluntary and mandatory consumer product safety standards. Those standards were meant to be updated as the machines evolved. In 2002, ATV safety advocates asked the CPSC to ban the sale of adult-size ATVs sold for the use of children under the age of 16. But the petition for the ban didn’t go very far. Instead, the commission left states with ultimate jurisdiction over how and where these machines can be used, as well as any age restrictions. But doctors, federal regulators, and even ATV manufacturers for years have all agreed on one premise: children should not ride or drive ATVs designed for adults. Between 2016 and 2020, a CPSC report estimated around 140,000 children under the age of 16 ended up in emergency rooms for ATV-related injuries. That’s the equivalent of every child in the state of Wyoming going to an emergency room for this singular reason. According to that same report, the CPSC estimated that number, 69,000 of those injured were younger than 12. Most were boys. But, according to an InvestigateTV analysis of state laws, federal guidance recommending age limits for all-terrain vehicles – primarily based on engine size – has largely been ignored. InvestigateTV found ATV laws across the country vary greatly. These laws, which in some locations are issued at the county level, typically establish registration requirements, speed, and age limits, as well as helmet requirements. At least 40 states lack restrictions that would stop children younger than 16 from operating adult-sized ATVs, and 13 states have no age limit at all. InvestigateTV also found nine states still don’t have helmet laws as safety requirements. Laws in Texas and South Carolina allow children as young as six to drive all-terrain vehicles, with the former setting limits on the size of the ATV. Some states, like Minnesota, allow children as young as 10 to ride ATVs as long as the child has previously taken a safety course. Minnesota is also one of only a few states that allow all-terrain vehicles to be operated on public paved roads and highways. The state is home to Polaris and Arctic Cat, two of the largest manufacturers of all-terrain vehicles. In at least 10 states, ATVs are completely prohibited from being used on roads. ‘It’s very confusing for a rider who wants to follow the rules’ Former Consumer Federation of America Legislative Director and General Counsel Rachel Weintraub said this “hodgepodge” of state laws regulating all-terrain vehicles creates confusion. “It’s very confusing because there’s a warning on the vehicle that says, ‘Don’t do that,’” Weintraub said. “And yet the state, some states or some parts of the state, a jurisdiction, a municipality, a smaller entity within the state that could allow for road use. So, it’s very confusing for a rider who wants to follow the rules.” In one of her first projects with the nonprofit organization, Weintraub worked to address children being injured in incidents involving all-terrain vehicles that were too large and powerful for them to safely operate. Since 2013, the organization has collected the most current off-highway vehicle data, which includes ATV fatalities. In 2023, the CFA tallied 291 ATV-related fatalities. Children under the age of 15 had the highest number of deaths of any age group, with 54. The organization’s analysis identified Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Texas, and Wisconsin as having the most ATV-related fatalities in the country. “We know what we need to do to make these vehicles safer for these numbers to go down dramatically, but it’s not in place yet,” Weintraub said. “We really need to think about the best ways to ensure that children are on vehicles that are the right size and powerfulness for them.” According to CPSC, ATVs remain the most dangerous discretionary use product for children. “ATVs and side by side (vehicles) together are responsible for the greatest number of deaths in our jurisdiction,” CSPC Commissioner Richard Trumka said. InvestigateTV found the first all-terrain vehicle recall occurred in August of 2000. Since then, there have been a total of 270 recalls of these types of vehicles, as of Dec. 2023. By comparison, since the CPSC issued its first-ever recall in June 1973, those involving ATVs have far outpaced more widely-used consumer products such as, · Refrigerators, 29 recalls; · Candles, 95 recalls; · Cribs/bassinets/portable cribs (like pack-n-plays), 188 recalls. Those are recalls that have occurred over the entirety of the CPSC’s 51-year existence - nearly three decades before the first ATV recall. According to data collected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from 2018 to 2022, there have been 1,602 deaths on ATVs. In 2022, there were 455 deaths, an increase of more than 100 deaths from the year prior. CSPC Commissioner Trumka, an ATV owner himself, said the agency is constantly updating its standards to protect families, but he does question if the standards have gone far enough to prevent deaths. “I use these products. I wouldn’t want them going away at all, but I do want to make sure that if me and my child are on one, we are going to be safe,” Trumka said. Safety precautions by doctors For years the American Academy of Pediatrics has conducted research on the health threat all-terrain vehicles may have on the well-being of children and adolescents. The organization recommends that children under the age of 16 should not drive ATVs. Dr. Jeffrey Haynes, medical director of the pediatric trauma center at the Children’s Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University, agreed. “It comes down to children under 16 shouldn’t do it because of the lack of, or relative lack of judgment, neuromuscular coordination, split-second decision making on a machine that is top heavy, that can curve and flip at any point in time,” Haynes said. He added, “don’t do it” is the first thought that comes to mind when he thinks of children on all-terrain vehicles. “Unfortunately, a lot of these deaths occur in the field and therefore are not transported here, but we have had children come in with severe head injuries, chest injuries, and abdominal injuries that despite our best efforts, we cannot save their life,” Haynes said. He said in his experience, most are injured in the head or neck because the rider wasn’t wearing a helmet. Haynes strongly suggested parents who allow their children to ride ATVs wear helmets and have the proper gear. He also suggested completing an ATV safety training course. The Specialty Vehicle Institute of America, a national, not-for-profit trade association representing manufacturers and distributors of ATVs provides safety courses on its site. In a statement, SVIA told InvestigateTV: “The Specialty Vehicle Institute of America and all our member companies are committed to rider safety and education – to helping all riders learn how to ride safely and responsibly. Our vehicles are part of American life, and are used by millions for agriculture, business, law enforcement, emergency response, military service, and outdoor enjoyment. SVIA offers free comprehensive training – both online and hands-on courses -- with every new vehicle purchased. We generate and promote safety content to communicate the importance of training. Among the messages we aggressively discuss on all of our channels are the Golden Rules of Riding: 1. Always wear a Department of Transportation (DOT) compliant helmet, goggles, long sleeves, long pants, over-the-ankle boots, and gloves 2. Never ride on paved roads except to cross when done safely and permitted by law – another vehicle could hit you. ATVs are designed to be operated off-highway. 3. Never ride under the influence of alcohol or drugs. 4. Never carry a passenger on a single-rider ATV and no more than one passenger on an ATV specifically designed for two people. 5. Ride an ATV that is right for your age. 6. Supervise riders younger than 16; ATVs are not toys. 7. Ride only on designated trails and at a safe speed. 8. Take a hands-on ATV RiderCourse and the free online eCourse. Visit ATVsafety.org” For Ashlee Bruggenschimidt, her fight for ATV safety continues years after her daughter’s death. In the seven years since Indiana enacted its helmet law, the state has only seen seven fatalities involving children, a significant decrease from the 29 it saw in the five years prior to the change. “I would love to see that helmets were mandated nationwide,” Bruggenschmidt said. “Helmets do save lives.” She has also helped build an accessible playground and established “Play for Kate,” a foundation in her daughter’s memory. But her biggest hope is to continue educating families. As an elementary school administrator, she has worked with several agencies and hospitals to build an ATV safety robot – Safety Sarah and Safety Sam – that goes around and talks to kids in the community about ATV safety. The robots wear helmets and appropriate safety gear on child-sized ATVs. Despite her loss, she doesn’t want ATVs to be banned. “I feel like ATVs are safe and they’re fun. I’m not anti-ATV I just want them to be driven safely,” she said.

Drivers flocked to her store Sunday night after a multi-car crash shut down I-75 southbound in Bartow County near mile marker 286. “At first all of the gas pumps filled up, and then I had a few people come inside needing the restroom, and they said because they’re sitting in traffic,” Lopez said. RELATED: 4 killed in crash on I-75 in Bartow County identified According to the Georgia State Patrol, evidence at the scene indicates that a Kia van was traveling northbound on I-75 when it left the roadway, crossed the grass median, and entered the southbound lanes of I-75. The Kia van collided with a Chevy Tahoe and a Toyota 4Runner, leading to a chain reaction involving two more vehicles. “They were telling me something about two or three people were already pulled out that didn’t make it. Then some guy came in and said it was between five and six people, and then I saw on Facebook that it was four,” Lopez said. The Bartow County Coroner confirmed four people died in the crash; 43-year-old Dakarai Mason, 35-year-old Erin Mason and their 15-year-old son Brandon Crawford were in one car. In another car, the deceased victim was identified as 21-year-old Aimee Odom. Mason was a civilian employee of the Holly Springs Police Department. “Yesterday, we lost a beloved member of our Holly Springs Police Department family,” the department said in a social media post Monday afternoon. “Please keep the family of Erin and Dakarai Mason in your thoughts and prayers. We ask that everyone be respectful of the family’s wishes for privacy during their time of grieving.” Odom was a student at Kennesaw State University, the school confirmed. The news of four fatalities and six other people injured in the crash is leaving the small community stunned. “There’s not really words you can say to make anything better like that,” Lopez said. Atlanta News first spoke with Erin Mason’s uncle. He said the family is asking for prayers and privacy at this time.

(Atlanta News First) - A woman from Ohio was sentenced to 25 years after pleading guilty to trafficking a 16-year-old girl in Atlanta, according to Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr. Jameesha Harris, 21, of Cleveland, Ohio, also pleaded guilty to trafficking in cocaine and possession of marijuana, Carr announced Wednesday. The charges stem from a traffic stop in the Greensboro area on Aug. 2, 2023. A Greene County sheriff’s deputy tried to pull over a car that improperly stopped at the intersection of GA-15 and GA-77 during a highway interdiction operation, prosecutors said. The car was driven by 32-year-old Anthony Holmes of Ohio. Harris and a 16-year-old girl were riding in the car. RELATED: GBI: Ohio man charged for trafficking teen in Atlanta Prosecutors said Holmes sped away, leading to a pursuit into Taliaferro County, where deputies stopped the car with a precision immobilization technique, or PIT, maneuver. Carr said authorities learned the 16-year-old had been reported missing out of South Carolina. She’d previously been reported missing by her family in Ohio. Investigators determined that Holmes and Harris had transported the girl from South Carolina to Atlanta to perform commercial sex acts. Law enforcement officials also reportedly found more than 28 grams of cocaine “prepared for distribution,” over an ounce of marijuana and a gun in the vehicle. Carr said Holmes and Harris were indicted by the attorney general’s Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit on Oct. 31, 2023. Harris pleaded guilty on April 8 to trafficking of persons for sexual servitude, trafficking in cocaine and possession of marijuana, according to prosecutors. She was sentenced to 25 years, with the first 10 years to be served in prison and the remainder on strict probation. Harris also must register as a sex offender. Carr said the case against Holmes is ongoing. “Our Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit has secured yet another conviction after assisting in the recovery of an underage victim,” Carr said in a statement. “As we have seen time and again, those involved in the trafficking of a child are often engaged in other criminal activity, and they must be held accountable. By working with partners like District Attorney Wright Barksdale, the Greene County Sheriff’s Office, the Taliaferro County Sheriff’s Office, and GBI’s HEAT Unit, we will continue to use the full force of the law to ensure traffickers are off our streets and our children are kept safe.” Copyright 2024 WANF.

(Atlanta News First) - The man once known as America’s mayor has agreed to stop accusing two former Fulton County election workers of election tampering. According to CNN, Rudy Giuliani — who remains under indictment in Fulton County along with former President Donald Trump and 12 others — reached an agreement in federal court Tuesday to stop spreading falsehoods about Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss. Giuliani repeatedly accused the mother and daughter of tampering with votes in the 2020 election. The agreement, according to CNN, means Giuliani is essentially forfeiting a years-long verbal and legal battle he’s waged with the two women. Freeman and Moss have already successfully sued Giuliani for defamation and won a $148 million judgment against him. The agreement still has to be approved by federal judges. During several legislative hearings at the Georgia Capitol in December 2020, prosecutors said Giuliani promoted allegations of widespread election fraud in Georgia. Prosecutors have said Giuliani was also involved in a plan to have the 16 Georgia Republicans serve as fake electors. Trump, Giuliani, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and others are appealing a Fulton County Superior Court ruling that allows District Attorney Fani Willis to continue prosecuting the historic indictments she handed down in August 2023. On April 1, Trump and the remaining defendants in Georgia’s historic racketeering indictment formally appealed Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee’s ruling. That appeal came after McAfee gave the green light to allow such an appeal over his decision. The appeal was signed by all of the attorneys representing the remaining co-defendants who have not already settled the case in Fulton County Superior Court. In March, McAfee rejected defense efforts to remove Willis and her office over her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, but he did give the defendants permission to seek a review of his decision from the appeals court. In his ruling, McAfee wrote Willis must remove Wade from the racketeering indictment if she were to remain on the case. Wade resigned just hours after that ruling. The move to disqualify Willis began in early January after Michael Roman, one of Trump’s co-defendants, and Ashleigh Merchant, Roman’s attorney, accused Willis and Wade of having an improper relationship. Both Willis and Wade have since acknowledged a romantic relationship. The allegations that Willis had improperly benefited from her romance with Wade upended the case for weeks. Intimate details of Willis and Wade’s personal lives were aired in court in mid-February. Trump and 18 others were indicted in August, accused of illegally trying to overturn his narrow 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden in Georgia. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all of the criminal charges that have been filed against him since he left the White House in 2021, including those filed by Willis.

(AP) — The Georgia Ports Authority reported Tuesday that April was its busiest month ever for automobile shipments as the Port of Brunswick took in thousands of additional car and truck imports that needed rerouting from Baltimore in the aftermath of its deadly bridge collapse. The second-busiest U.S. port for autos, Brunswick moved more than 80,000 vehicles and heavy machinery units across its docks last month, a whopping 44% increase compared with April 2023. The surge included 9,000 automobile imports and 1,000 pieces of heavy machinery that were diverted from the Port of Baltimore, the nation’s top auto port. Baltimore has been closed to most ships since the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed March 26, killing six people, after a container ship crashed into one of its columns. The Brunswick port, located 70 miles (112 kilometers) south of Savannah, had plenty of room to absorb the additional autos, said Griff Lynch, CEO of the Georgia Ports Authority. The agency’s board is investing $262 million in upgrades and expansions to boost Brunswick’s capacity. Completed projects include 80 acres (32 hectares) of additional outdoor storage and 450,000 square feet (41,800 square meters) of new warehouse space. “We’ve expanded so much in Brunswick, I would say that it did not stretch us,” Lynch said. “We’ve got a tremendous amount of capacity down there.” It wasn’t just the Baltimore shutdown that drove additional autos to Georgia. The Brunswick port had its second-busiest month on record for autos and heavy machinery in March, which had mostly passed before the bridge collapse. Auto shipments to Georgia have been booming since last year, when U.S. auto sales saw their biggest increase in a decade. That led to the Port of Brunswick handling a record 775,000 automobiles and heavy machinery units in calendar year 2023. Lynch said he expects the 2024 fiscal year that ends June 30 to be even stronger, exceeding 800,000 auto and machinery units. The impact of the Baltimore shutdown should be over by then. The damaged ship Dali was refloated and escorted back to port by tugboats Monday. A controlled demolition earlier this month broke down the largest remaining span of the collapsed bridge. Baltimore’s port director says the shipping channel will be cleared to its full 700-foot (213-meter) width sometime in June. “The Baltimore thing will now subside,” Lynch said of Georgia’s auto import influx from the shutdown to the north. “I would think in the next couple of weeks, we’re done.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

All of Georgia’s 14 congressional districts will be contested this fall, but the November ballot has already been set for these four metro Atlanta congressional races. 3rd district Brian Jack and state Sen. Mike Dugan (R-Carrollton) are headed to a June 18 runoff to replace the retiring U.S. Rep. Drew Ferguson in the 3rd congressional district. Jack has the very public endorsement of Trump, while Dugan is the former state Senate majority leader who resigned his seat to run for Congress. The west-central Georgia district includes most of metro Atlanta’s southern suburbs and stretches southwestward to portions of Columbus. 6th district U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath defeated Democratic primary challenges from Jerica Richardson and Mandisha Thomas, and will face Republican Jeff Criswell in November. 11th district U.S. Rep. Barry Loudermilk defeated Republicans Lori Pesta and Michael Pons to win the GOP primary. He will face Democrat Katy Stamper in a heavily Republican district. 13th district U.S. Rep. David Scott defeated six other Democrats in his primary to win his party’s reelection bid. He will face Republican Jonathan Chavez, who won his party’s primary on Tuesday, in November. 14th district Clarence Blalock and Shawn Harris will face off in a runoff for the Democratic nomination for the 14th congressional, one of which will face the unenviable task of running against one of the nation’s highest-profile Republican congressional officials. Whoever wins the Democratic primary will face incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in November in a heavily GOP-leaning district. Georgia Supreme Court Justice Andrew Pinson defeated Democrat John Barrow’s attempt to unseat him over the issue of abortion. Pinson was appointed to the nine-justice court in 2022 by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp; the three other justices seeking new six-year terms were unopposed. Barrow, a former Georgia congressman, made abortion his campaign’s centerpiece, and said Georgia’s state constitution guarantees a right to abortion that is at least as strong as Roe v. Wade was before it was overturned in 2022. Arguably one of the nation’s highest profile district attorneys, Fani Willis defeated fellow Democrat Christian Wise Smith on Tuesday. Willis is the DA who brought down a series of historic indictments against Trump and 17 others on charges they engaged in an organized crime-like conspiracy to overturn Georgia’s 2020 election. That election saw Joe Biden become the first Democrat since 1992 to win any deep Southern state in a presidential contest. Willis will face Republican Courtney Kramer in a heavily Democratic Fulton County on Nov. 5, 2024. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee defeated the two challengers - Robert Patillo and Tiffani Johnson - who wanted to replace the jurist overseeing one of the nation’s most contentious judicial, political and social cases in U.S. history. McAfee is the Fulton County Superior Court judge who has drawn the case against Trump. The former president’s attorneys are now appealing McAfee’s decision to allow Willis to remain on the case despite her now-admitted involvement with a former special prosecutor - Nathan Wade - whom she hired to assist in her investigation and subsequent indictment. Incumbent Fulton County Sheriff Pat Labat won over challengers Kirt Beasley, James Brown and Joyce Farmer in Georgia Democratic primary. Labat faces no GOP challenge this November, meaning his victory effectively secures another term in office. An award-winning series from Atlanta News First Investigates reporter Andy Pierrotti highlighted conditions at the Fulton County Jail, a facility that has gained national attention for its overcrowded conditions and inmate injuries and deaths.

In Curry’s words, Taylor commanded her “to Donald Trump this thing.” In Georgia, processing passports is an easy way for some elected superior court clerks to put thousands of dollars in fees into their own personal bank accounts. An Atlanta News First Investigation uncovered in 2021 alone, Taylor raked in more than $220,000, while Fulton Superior Court Clerk Cathelene “Tina” Robinson pocketed more than $360,000 in passport processing fees. Those fees are in addition to their yearly salaries. Those applying for passports in Georgia are required to pay two fees. The application fee of $130 goes to the federal government. The processing fee is $35; that goes directly to the superior court clerk’s office, where they can do whatever they want with it. This past legislative session, lawmakers passed a bill sponsored by state Sen. Kay Kirkpatrick (R-Marietta) that would, among other provisions, require superior court clerks to disclose the total amount of all passport application fees during each quarter. According to a 2017 Association County Commissioners of Georgia (ACCG) survey, 87 of Georgia’s 159 counties were currently processing passport applications. Of those, 54 court clerks or probate judges were keeping some or all of the passport processing fees as personal compensation. As Atlanta News First Investigates began its research, the GBI began investigating Taylor for mishandling passport shipping fees. Federal law allows government officials to keep passport processing fees as long as state law designates it. Georgia law does just that. However, Taylor is accused of collecting $86,000 in passport shipping fees, which clerks are not allowed to keep, according to state law.

I just didn’t know how broken.” Since the beginning of 2023, thirteen people have died in the County’s custody at the Fulton County Jail. Labat has been in office since January 2021. “We inherited this system, and it is one that allows people to languish in jail, waiting for the opportunity to either get the mental health help they need or have their competency restored,” he said. Labat said when the jail was built in 1989, it was never intended to detain people for years at a time. At one point, it detained 3,600 people, more than twice the capacity. Most of the inmates are charged with violent felonies, while 187 were in jail on misdemeanor charges as of late summer. Labat said his office is caught between the district attorney’s office and judges, waiting for them to move cases along, while his jail and detainees suffer the consequences. In July, the U.S Department of Justice announced it launched a civil investigation into the conditions of the jail. According to a press release, the federal government will “examine living conditions, medical and mental health care, use of excessive force, and protection from violence.” To alleviate overcrowding, the sheriff has transferred hundreds of inmates to neighboring counties. He’s also suggested moving some out of state as far away as Mississippi, against the objection from defense attorneys. Labat even wrote a letter to each of Georgia’s 158 sheriffs, asking if any of them had beds available. But these actions are a band-aid to the problem, Labat said. The court’s ability to clear the case backlog and sustain it is out of his control. He’s calling to build a new, bigger facility focused on mental health services, which could cost taxpayers more than $1 billion. “There’s enough blame to go around,” Labat said. “I can tell you who is not to blame: the sheriff’s office.” Atlanta News First and Atlanta News First+ provide you with the latest news, headlines and insights as Georgia continues its role at the forefront of the nation’s political scene.

(Atlanta News First) - Results for Georgia’s 2024 primary election are in. Polls closed at 7 p.m. >> CLICK HERE FOR FULL ELECTION RESULTS The Georgia Secretary of State’s Office held a press conference following polls closing in Tuesday’s election. On a busy election day on Tuesday, the Georgia Secretary of State My Voter Page website went offline for about an hour due to heavy traffic. The office said the website was offline because the website vendor, Salesforce, wasn’t prepared to handle the number of people on the site at the same time. The site has been restored. Gabe Sterling, the office’s chief operating officer, said almost 160,000 page views had been logged by around 3 p.m. at the My Voter Page, which he described in a social media post as “heavy traffic.” He also said overall wait times on Tuesday were less than a minute across Georgia. >> Extended coverage on ANF+ right here, FireTV, AppleTV, Roku and YouTube starting at 7:30 p.m Late Tuesday afternoon, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said the primary was on track to record 1.1 million votes, including early votes. He also confirmed Sterling’s less-than-one-minute-in-line wait times. Raffensperger - a Republican who has been mentioned as a possible Georgia gubernatorial candidate in 2026 - said the U.S. Postal Services presented several unspecified challenges in terms of the state’s absentee early voting process. “They’ll have to step their game up for the fall,” Raffensperger said. Many local positions were up for grabs across the state. In some counties, voters helped decide their next sheriff or district attorney. “I think that’s all part of being an American citizen, that you should be out there and want to have the best people for your area to do the job,” said a Cobb County resident who voted on Tuesday. One open congressional seat and challenges to the men and women who are overseeing Donald Trump’s indictment and the nation’s most notorious jail were all on the ballot Tuesday. Georgia’s 3rd congressional district - stretching from southwest metro Atlanta down to Columbus - had five Republicans and two Democrats seeking the right to represent their party this November to replace the retiring U.S. Rep. Drew Ferguson. Fulton County’s DA Fani Willis, Sheriff Pat Labat and Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee were all facing primary challenges. Willis is the district attorney who brought down a series of historic indictments against Trump and 17 others on charges they engaged in a criminal conspiracy to overturn Georgia’s 2020 presidential election. Fani Willis defeated Christian Wise Smith, setting up a Nov. 5, 2024, race against Republican Courtney Kramer. Willis was declared the night’s first winner by the Associated Press, which called the race shortly after 7:30 p.m. Scott McAfee defeated Robert Patillo and Tiffani Johnson. McAfee is the jurist who drew the nation’s 45th president’s case, while Labat wants another term overseeing the administration of the Fulton County Jail, which has gained national attention for its overcrowded conditions and inmate deaths and injuries. Incumbent Fulton County Sheriff Pat Labat is one step closer to reelection. He took 54 percent of the vote. Labat will not face a GOP challenge this November, meaning a victory effectively secures election to the office. In DeKalb County, three candidates were seeking to succeed Michael Thurmond as CEO. The race now heads to a runoff between Lorraine Cochran-Johnson and Larry Johnson. All of Georgia’s 14 congressional districts will be contested this fall, but the November ballot has already been set for four metro Atlanta congressional races. In District Four, longtime Democratic incumbent Hank Johnson faced no primary competitor. Nor did Republican Eugene Yu, meaning they will meet on Nov. 5, 2024, in a district that Johnson has represented since 2007. Downtown Atlanta’s 5th district is represented by U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams, a Democrat who succeeded the legendary John Lewis in 2020 after his death. Republican John Salvesen is running unopposed for a district that covers three-quarters of the city of Atlanta. Williams is also chair of the Georgia Democratic Party. In northern metro Atlanta’s 7th district, Republican congressman Rich McCormick had no opposition; nor did Democrat Bob Christian. Independent candidate Charles King will also face them in November. In the 9th, U.S. Rep. Andrew Clyde has represented the northeast Georgia district since 2021. With no Republican opposition in the heavily GOP-leaning district, he is facing Democrat Tambrei Cash this November.

(Atlanta News First) - Brian Jack, with the endorsement of former President Donald Trump, and state Sen. Mike Dugan are headed toward a runoff late Tuesday night in Georgia’s only open congressional seat in Tuesday’s primary. Jack and Dugan are seeking to replace U.S. Rep. Drew Ferguson, who announced late last year he was retiring from Congress. Ferguson’s 11th district stretches from metro Atlanta’s southern suburbs to north of Columbus, and includes a small part of the Fountain City itself. It is considered to be safely Republican, having been represented by Lynn Westmoreland until he chose not to seek reelection in 2016. The winner will face Maura Keller, who defeated Val Almonord for the Democratic nomination. Ferguson sits on the U.S. House Ways and Means and Budget committees. After hard-line congressional Republicans ousted then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last year, the House was thrown in a vacuum of leadership chaos. Numerous votes were undertaken by GOP leadership to elect a new speaker, and Ferguson reported receiving death threats after he withdrew his support for U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio. After Ferguson cast his vote for U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Ferguson said he and his family began receiving death threats, and protestors picketed his Newnan, Georgia, district office. Republican Jared Craig launched a hugely unsuccessful primary challenge against Ferguson in 2022. The Republican incumbent then cruised to an easy reelection over Democrat Val Almonard, who also unsuccessfully ran against Ferguson in 2020.

Pinson was appointed to the nine-justice court in 2022 by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp; the three other justices seeking new six-year terms are unopposed.

Barrow, a former Georgia congressman, made abortion his campaign’s centerpiece, and said Georgia’s state constitution guarantees a right to abortion that is at least as strong as Roe v.

(Atlanta News First) - The Fulton County district attorney who filed a series of historic indictments last year against former President Donald Trump easily defeated a challenge from within her own Democratic party on Tuesday. Fani Willis defeated Christian Wise Smith in Georgia’s general primary, setting up a Nov. 5, 2024, race against Republican Courtney Kramer. Willis was declared the night’s first winner by the Associated Press, which called the race shortly after 7:30 p.m. “We’re in this fight for the long haul,” Willis said in a Tuesday night victory speech. “This election is bringing into focus very important matters.” Nathan Wade, the former special prosecutor who had a now-admitted romantic relationship with Willis, attended the district attorney’s victory party. Willis’ and Wade’s relationship could result in the DA’s disqualification from her further prosecution of the case. Willis also took shots at Kramer, saying, “She does not have allegiance to the people of my county.

That election saw Joe Biden become the first Democrat since Bill Clinton in 1992 to carry Georgia or any other deep Southern state. But now, the Georgia Court of Appeals has agreed to consider a motion by Trump and his Georgia attorneys to disqualify Willis from her investigation because of Willis’s and Wade’s romantic relationship. On April 1, Trump and the remaining defendants in Georgia’s historic racketeering indictment formally appealed Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee’s ruling. That appeal came after McAfee gave the green light to allow such an appeal over his decision. In March, McAfee rejected defense efforts to remove Willis and her office over her romantic relationship with Wade, but he did give the defendants permission to seek a review of his decision from the appeals court. In his ruling, McAfee wrote Willis must remove Wade from the racketeering indictment if she were to remain on the case. Wade resigned just hours after that ruling. The move to disqualify Willis began in early January after Michael Roman, one of Trump’s co-defendants, and Ashleigh Merchant, Roman’s attorney, accused Willis and Wade of having an improper relationship. Both Willis and Wade have since acknowledged a romantic relationship. The allegations that Willis had improperly benefited from her romance with Wade upended the case for weeks. Intimate details of Willis and Wade’s personal lives were aired in court in mid-February.

I think everyone is excited to see this property come to life again in a way that both respects the history and lifts up the history, but also brings a new chapter to this neighborhood,” Atlanta City Councilmember Amir Farokhi said. The first phase of the redevelopment is scheduled to begin at the end of this year, and a portion of the project will be ready to show off during the World Cup in 2026. “The nice thing about this development is it’s being done by Atlanta Housing, whose mandate is affordable housing, so you’re going to see hundreds if not more affordable housing units in this development,” Farokhi said. The only concern Atlanta News First heard from people in this area is that this new development will bring more traffic. They are asking the developer and the Atlanta Housing Authority to consider adding bicycle lanes and alternative transportation options. Copyright 2024 WANF.

(Atlanta News First) - A University of Georgia quarterback filed a lawsuit against the University of Florida’s head football coach and other officials on Tuesday, arguing they dangled a false “name and likeness” (NIL) deal to motivate him to sign with the team. According to the suit filed in Florida, Jaden Rashada was promised a $13.85 million NIL deal if he signed with Billy Napier’s Florida Gators. But after he agreed, the officials “changed their tune and went back on their word,” significantly cutting the deal, according to the suit. “Jaden’s miserable experience reveals in stark and dramatic detail what can happen to young student-athletes when wealthy, win-at-all-cost alumni insert themselves into college football’s recruiting process,” the suit says. Other defendants include major Gators football booster Huge Hathcock and his company, Velocity Automotive, alongside Marcus Castro-Walker, the school’s former director of player engagement and NIL. >> READ THE FULL LAWSUIT: The defendants allegedly offered more money than other competitors — including the University of Miami, which offered $9.5 million — before trying to “strong-arm” Rashada into signing a much smaller deal. Napier promised him $1 million if he signed with UF, and Castro-Walker told Rashada that Napier might toss him aside if he didn’t commit, the lawsuit claims. Rashada is suing on various fraud and tortious interference counts, alongside a liability count against Velocity Automotive. The complaint asks for a jury trial and at least $10 million in damages. “Sadly, this type of fraud is becoming more commonplace in the Wild West that is today’s college NIL landscape,” attorney Rusty Hardin, who is representing Rashada, told the Associated Press. “Wealthy alumni, consumed by their schools’ athletic programs, are taking advantage of young people by offering them life-changing sums of money, only to renege on their commitments.” After the deal with Florida fell through, Rashada signed with Arizona State. He has since transferred to play for the Georgia Bulldogs. Florida had been under NCAA investigation since last June regarding Rashada’s recruitment. But in March, the NCAA halted investigations into booster-backed collectives or other third parties making NIL compensation deals with Division I athletes. This is a developing story.

There are plenty of Dream games with tickets at general admission prices. Fans can buy them through Dream’s website, which redirects to Ticketmaster, or they can go directly to Ticketmaster’s website. Ticketmaster requires new users to sign up, but once you do, you can buy general admission tickets or verified resale tickets from independent sellers at market price. The second option for sold-out or desirable seats is through online third-party broker sites that allow anyone to sell their seats at any price. Seats are verified, and if the buyer must cancel, they can use the same site to sell: Ticket brokers are fans’ third option and may include hotel and travel. The National Association of Ticket Brokers has a directory of verified brokers, and fans can search for local brokers. Facebook Marketplace has evolved into another version of Craigslist, and it’s become difficult to find legitimate sellers. Scammers got smart and hijacked thousands of established profiles to appear legitimate. A buyer may believe the seller has four friends in common but don’t know that it could be a stolen profile. If the seller is willing to meet you in person and transfer the tickets through Ticketmaster, you may save a few bucks, but paying more through a verified seller is the best way to go.

(Atlanta News First) - In 2019, commercial flights released more than 900 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere — and that number continues to increase. But a new study at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) could help reduce the massive figure. The airport is partnering with Delta Air Lines, Airbus and Plug Power to conduct a study measuring the feasibility of future hydrogen fueling. Until the end of 2026, officials will investigate infrastructure, safety requirements and other variables, the airport announced on Tuesday. “Hartsfield-Jackson has long been a leader in the commercial aviation industry, and it only makes sense that we help lead this effort,” Michael Smith, the airport’s senior deputy general manager, said. “If hydrogen proves to be a viable alternative, ATL will investigate options to update infrastructure in order to implement the new technology. We are thrilled to participate in this study and look forward to the results.” PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson named world’s busiest airport in 2023 According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, hydrogen fuel cells combine oxygen and hydrogen atoms to create electricity. Instead of releasing Earth-warming gases, their main byproduct is water, alongside a small amount of heat. Hydrogen fuel cells are already used to power electrical systems in spacecraft, as well as a handful of experimental buses, trains and planes. The study at Hartsfield-Jackson is part of Airbus’ Hydrogen Hub at Airports program, which has partnered with airports worldwide to look into hydrogen fueling. The company’s goal is to launch the world’s first hydrogen-powered commercial plane by 2035. Hartsfield-Jackson joined the Airbus ZEROe program, which aims to figure out the logistics of hydrogen planes, in 2022. “The U.S. has easy and massive access to additional renewable energies to produce green hydrogen, and airports are looking for a diverse and balanced energy mix to be more resilient and help reduce the impact of aviation on the environment. Hydrogen is a key enabler for this,” Karine Guénan, Airbus’ ZEROe Ecosystem vice president, said.

(WALB) - A recently graduated Deerfield-Windsor student died in a car crash on Monday, May 20. According to Georgia State Patrol (GSP), troopers arrived at the scene of a single-vehicle crash at around 2 a.m. on Bobby Locke Road in Terrell County. A white Ford F-150 was headed south on Bobby Locke Road. GSP says the car exited the highway while going around a curve and went onto the east shoulder for about 260 feet. The truck hit a culvert and became airborne, hitting a guy wire. The passenger, Vansh Patel, was ejected. The truck continued south, still airborne, before hitting a tree with its roof. It came to an uncontrolled rest on the driver’s side, facing west. The driver, David Mullins, was pronounced dead at the scene. Patel was lifeflighted to Grady Memorial Hospital. On Monday, Deerfield-Windsor head Football Coach Brian McCrae posted to Facebook about David Mullins’ death: “We will just rally around our loved ones and live like David would want us to live,” the post said. In the post, McCrae said that he is also praying for Patel and his family. Earlier this month, Coroner Michael Fowler posted to Facebook that Mullins was awarded a $2,000 scholarship from the Albany Rotary Club and planned to attend the University of Georgia. Deerfield-Windsor Head of School Allen Lowe told WALB that they are not making a comment at this time, but they are “doing what they can” to support the family and students during this time. WALB has reached out to the Georgia State Patrol for more information on this crash. WALB’s Katelyn Barker will have more in our 4 p.m., 5 p.m., and 6 p.m. newscasts.

(Atlanta News First) – In the hours leading up to the polls opening for the Georgia Primary elections, the race for Henry County Sheriff is drawing extra drama. One candidate, Walter Woolfork was just removed from the ballot after the Elections Board found he did not qualify due to issues surrounding how he submitted his fingerprints as part of qualifying. “I’m mad. Don’t get it twisted. I’m mad as hell,” said Woolfork, in an interview with Atlanta News First. He said he’s trying to say positive and is looking forward to potentially running again in 2028. Woolfork showed Atlanta News First the documented order from the County Board of Elections and Voter Registration, signed on Friday, May 17. In a special meeting on Friday, the Board disqualified Woolfork from the election. “Candidate Walter Woolfork failed to meet the constitutional and statutory qualifications for the office of Sheriff. Specifically, Woolfork failed to submit to a fingerprint-based background check as directed by the Probate Judge as mandated by O.C.G.A 15-16-1(c)(1)(G),” the order stated. Woolfork said he got his fingerprints issued at the County Sheriff’s Office and not the Probate Court when he submitted his qualifications for the race in March. Woolfork was critical that the Board did not alert him of this mistake until four days before the election, thus disqualifying him from race. “You don’t wait until the last day of early voting and then decide to put a candidate out of the race,” said Woolfork. Without Woolfork, the three remains candidates in the Democratic primary for Sheriff are Willie Brown, Cornell ‘CJ’ Madison, and incumbent Reginald Scandrett. Over the weekend, Madison, reported he had roughly 1500 campaign signs stolen. He said the cost of the signs equated to roughly $20,000, raised from primarily public donations. “I myself will not be intimidated by someone trying to stop me from running for office. The money that I get comes from myself or all these hard-working citizens of Henry County that want change. It’s unfortunate that their money is being stolen,” Madison told Atlanta News First. He said those signs were stolen from outside gas stations, street corners, and front yards of homes. In dashcam footage acquired by Atlanta News First, a white truck pulls up to a home outside of Stockbridge and steals a campaign banner promoting Madison. A man jumps out of the truck, rips the banners from its stakes, and throws it in the back of the truck. Before driving off, you can see a resident of the home run outside towards the truck. Atlanta News First spoke with the residents of the home who verified what happened. A source within the Henry County Police Department confirmed that they are investigating the stolen campaign signs. Atlanta News First reached out to the police department, but a spokesperson did not provide a status update in the case. Madison said among his top issues he’d like to address if elected would be to improve the conditions at the Henry County Jail, specifically how County funds are implemented. Six people have died in the County’s custody at the Henry County Jail since the beginning of 2023, according to a spokesperson for the Henry County Sheriff’s Office. Atlanta News First reached out to all candidates in the democratic primary. Willie Brown did not respond. Sheriff Reginald Scandrett provided the following statement. “I am not going to dignify the issue related to stealing signs with an answer. He has lost all credibility,” said Sheriff Scandrett, in a statement provided by a campaign staff member. “The removal of a candidate Woolfork from the ballot, while unfortunate, is within the realm of the Board of Elections and Voter Registration,” the statement continued. Atlanta News First redacted a portion of the statement because claims surrounding the past of one of the candidates were not verified. Copyright 2024 WANF.

A business owner of six years along Auburn Avenue, Quita Andrews says she’s optimistic for the future, despite the current violence that plagues her neighborhood. “Businesses like me are coming into the neighborhood.

(Atlanta News First) - Just one day left until Georgians go to the polls for the May primary. Candidates are competing within their own party to win the right to compete for jobs in the November general election. As of Friday, the final and busiest day of Georgia’s three-week early voting period, the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office said around 513,000 people had already voted. Some 65,000 of those voters cast absentee ballots, but because of delay issues at Georgia’s U.S. Post Office locations, officials recommend checking on the Secretary of State’s ballot tracker page to make sure your absentee ballot got where it needed to go. “If it has not been accepted, make a plan to go to your polling location to vote on Tuesday,” said Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer of the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office. “We were in really bad shape with the USPS but our office has really put the hammer down on them and they’ve put together an action plan, brought about 150 employees, redeployed them in the state and out of the state.” As always, bring your ID to your polling place, and unlike early voting, make sure you go only to your assigned precinct to vote. A number of big races are on ballots across metro Atlanta, perhaps none more so than in Fulton County. Sheriff Patrick Labat is facing a number of challengers, even from some former deputies of his, as is Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, the judge overseeing the election indictment case against former President Donald Trump. He faces a challenge from attorney and radio host Robert Patillo. One of the day’s most-watched races will be for Fulton County district attorney. Incumbent Fani Willis, the prosecutor behind the election indictment case, is facing attorney Christian Wise Smith, who on Monday called for Willis’ immediate resignation. He said a U.S. Senate inquiry into Willis’ misuse of state and federal funds meant for a youth gang prevention program and sexual assault survivors program, while still only accusations, was troubling. “The role of the district attorney is to protect the community in which it serves, not to steal resources intended to help rape victims and our youth,” said Wise Smith. “We need to get the office back on track.” Another key race that will appear as non-partisan on all Georgian’s ballots is for a seat on the state Supreme Court. Incumbent Justice Andrew Pinson, an appointee of Gov. Brian Kemp, was endorsed by the governor at the Capitol on Monday. RELATED: Who is on the ballot in the Georgia 2024 primary? The race has attracted attention after Pinson’s challenger, John Barrow, stated he’d rule to protect abortion rights if the state’s controversial six-week abortion ban comes before the court. “We can keep a justice system that’s fair and impartial,” said Pinson. “Or we can have a system of partisan politicians in black robes.” Copyright 2024 WANF.

The exhibit features the original puppets from the 1980′s production and the newer Apple TV edition. “There’s nothing like this place in the entire country,” Dylla said. It’s enough to bring in new employees from all over, human and puppet. “Uh, my name is Spekles,” said the long-haired, blue creature. “It’s spelled S-P-E-K-ekles.” Spekles says he moved from “way up north” and started his job as a tour guide moments before the interview. “I’ve worked here for, like, three-and-a-half minutes,” Spekles admitted. Despite being new to the Center for Puppetry Arts, Spekles is an expert on all things puppets. “Fraggle Rock is a television show created by Jim Henson,” Spekles explained. “And he famously said when he pitched the idea that he wanted to do a puppet show that would bring peace to the world.” The center is also getting first dibs at a unique take on Sesame Street The Musical, which concluded its run on Broadway in December 2023. “We are excited to be the first regional production of Sesame Street since Broadway,” Dylla announced. The plotline? “I think you have to go to see it,” Dylla said. “I don’t want to be a spoiler.” It all makes for a great time on the street or in the rock. “Puppets taught me how to count and how to read,” Dylla said. “It’s a fancy, fancy place,” Spekles added.

(Atlanta News First) - Activists gathered at Atlanta City Hall, rallying to support the City of Atlanta in its efforts to continue to build a $90 million public safety training center in Dekalb County. “We are talking about EMTs, firefighters, first responders are also going to be training at this center,” said Gabriel Nadales, national director for Our America, which is based in Virginia. Nadales said the facility, which is now under construction, is a big step in the right direction. “We need to make sure officers are better trained in community policing. When somebody deals with a case of autism for example that they know how to respond,” said Nadales. Pastor David Lowery traveled from Chicago with a warning. “If you don’t support this training center, and you allow what is happening in Chicago. If you allow what has happened to California and New Jersey then your town will become unsafe,” said Lowery. Elvia Davila, who lives in Gwinnett County, talked about the loss of her husband to crime and why she backs the project. “As a victim of crime here in Gwinnett County, Georgia and not receiving justice, I’m a champion of public safety for all,” she said.

(Atlanta News First) - If only there was a place for Atlanta readers to come together and celebrate the book they are reading while meeting new people. A place to socialize — or not. The beers from Steady Hand flowed as people started to arrive on Monday. “We come together with a book of your choice. You and mix and mingle with people have some time to just discuss books,” said Sophia Griesenauer with Silent Book Club Atlanta. Eventually, the music turned down, and the more than 100 people packing the patio and interior of the brewery took a seat. The meetings normally range between 130 to 170 people. “We have a dedicated reading hour and there is absolutely no talking, everyone adheres to it which is so awesome,” said Griesenauer. People seem to really like it and almost everyone is reading something different. Those involved are doing something both together and separately. It just might be an introvert’s dream. “Given a space where I can quietly read with others kind of like a parallel play, I can finish this Toni Morrison book,” said Danielle Clarke, a reader with Silent Book Club Atlanta. The Silent Book Club has an Atlanta Chapter. The global organization has over 900 chapters. Adults of all ages come to read. Once the session stops, people are free to talk to the people around them or just head home. The sessions move around the city. “As a new reader, I thought it would be special to step into this space with my books and hopefully meet new people,” said Spencer Bonner, another reader with Silent Book Club Atlanta. Books often have the ability to take readers to worlds they build in their heads. But in this case, books can become an avenue to help many become present with themselves and maybe, find a friend along the way. “When I push myself into situations like this. I get vivacious. I get fun. I am ready to be chatty and step out of myself,” said YahYah Scholfield, a reader with Silent Book Club Atlanta. Copyright 2024 WANF.

(Atlanta News First) - The MARTA Airport Station at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is back open after weeks of renovations. It’s the first major renovation at MARTA’s Airport Station. Atlanta News First got an exclusive look at the progress last week as crews put the finishing touches on the project ahead of Monday’s opening. Upgrades include everything from new paint, new floors, and new railing to changes to the tactile strips, which help passengers watch their step as they get on and off the train. “You’ll look and see that this used to be brick pavers downstairs and upstairs and what we’re looking at is Terrazzo flooring throughout the downstairs area and then upstairs is our larger tile pavers which provides for a much better...smoother and safer feel upstairs,” said MARTA Senior Project Manager Jermaine White. “Down here you will notice you don’t hear the clunking of the luggage going over those tiles. So, you’re not taking as much damage on your luggage as well down here,” he said. Since April 8, a shuttle service has connected travelers from College Park Station to and from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as crews worked on the renovations. Some riders were happy to see all of the new upgrades. “It’s beautiful. I mean this was worth the wait and as a member of the public. This was worth the wait. I take MARTA every single day from Austell, Georgia and the shuttle bus was a big inconvenience,” said Joshua Muldrow, a rider. “his is really nice. It’s a lot decent to see that the city is doing something for the public—-us hard working citizens out here,” he said. Muldrow works at airport parking nearby. He said the last few weeks, he had to get up extra early for his shift to catch the shuttle. “I have to be at work at 9, and I was leaving at 6 to get here on time,” Muldrow said. “On a regular basis I was leaving at like 7, maybe 7:30.” Muldrow said the new improvements brings a much different environment. “I’m from New York City, so subways are my life, so when I first took the subways here, I was like “whoa it smells in here, so coming to see that it’s nice,” Muldrow said. “I could see it from over there, and I’m like oh my God. It looks so bright and just so nice and clean.” Daffnie Giles who works at the airport agreed. “It’s more spacious. it’s more upcoming...the new new,” Giles said. “It’s looks better. It makes you feel like you want to come into the airport,” she said. “It’s more spacious. Cleaner. I feel safe.” MARTA says the six-week closure of the Airport Station saved 17 months of construction time. “It would’ve been a much longer process where we would only do a small portion of work every night and then shore up that work every night to then be open back up in the morning so that 17 months was saved by doing just six weeks of work,” said MARTA Senior Project Manager Jermaine White. MARTA’s Airport Station reopened early Monday morning, but more changes are on the way. “Major changes still coming. We still got some things to do down here to this area, but it’ll be much more different feel. Our biggest piece will be the transforming of the canopy that will be to accent the airport canopies that exists right now,” White said. Airport officials say the next phase of renovations is underway, and they will continue to work to make the space better. “It will be our new art mural that will probably be around the July time frame,” White said. “Our Ride Store here, will be actually flipping sides, so it’ll be over to our side over there, White said. “Then we’ll change this area to be bathroom and things for those same personnel,” White said. “Then upstairs, we’re looking at putting in the bathroom for our operators, so that will be on the other end where the platform comes in, so that way they don’t have to immediately run downstairs. They’ll have an operator booth bathroom right upstairs,” he said. Officials said as their work continues, they will remain open, and riders are happy about it. “We appreciate you MARTA, we thank y’all for what y’all did,” Muldrow said. Copyright 2024 WANF.

(Atlanta News First) - You’re tired. Maybe hungry. Likely stressed out after a long day of work ... or stressed out about something. But you suck it up and go do your civic privilege: vote! So what’s so bad about being tossed a bottle of water when you’re standing in line with everyone else? Because, chances are, the person tossing you that bottle of nature’s refreshing fluid is probably wearing a t-shirt that says, “Vote for {fill in candidate}.” Georgia’s gotten a lot of bad press over of its voting rules; even comedian Larry David got in on the fun during a recent episode of “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” The flubhub is all about this: Georgia elections officials don’t want anyone affiliated with a political organization to hand out food and beverages to voters in line outside a polling place. They’re worried about influencing how you vote. The Georgia law simply makes it a misdemeanor to give away food or water within 150 feet of the outer edge of a polling place or within 25 feet of any voter in line. Violations are punishable by up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. While people other than poll workers can give away food or water, they have to adhere to these boundaries to avoid breaking the law. Besides the bottles of water, what else do you need to know when you hit the polls on Tuesday ... or the June 18 runoff ... or the November 5 general election (you may have heard about that one...) The short answer is, likely the state-issued one with your most hideous image ever captured by a camera. Here’s the longer answer: No worries! The law requires that your county provide polling places that are accessible to people with disabilities. Georgia’s paper-ballot voting system includes adjustments to accommodate various disabilities. Headsets are available so you can hear your choices read to you. Large controls are available for people with limited mobility, and they can accommodate sip-and-puff devices. Also, if you are visually impaired, you can use an app on your phone to read your ballot to you before you cast it. Before you leave the polling place, you are required to delete any photos of your ballot necessary to read it. That’s also a good reminder, no you can’t snap a picture of your ballot or take a selfie with it. It’s not allowed. Need to see what your ballot will look like before you head to the voting booth? The Georgia Secretary of State’s website allows registered voters to see what their ballot will look like. This allows voters to know what they are voting for before casting their vote. On Election Day, voters will head to their specific voting precinct to cast their ballot. A voter’s specific polling location depends entirely on where that person lives in the county they are registered to vote in.

(Atlanta News First) — Earlier this month, three cars collided at the Super Duck Car Wash in Snellville. Maria Ruiz was taking her cousin’s Chevy Tahoe in for a clean before things quickly took a turn for the worse. “When the big brush in the middle came down, it hit the luggage rack on top,” she said. “I felt it when the car started shifting to the right.” Behind her was BeinSon Bracey, who regularly takes his 2010 Porsche Panamera into the car wash. “I started beeping my horn and the next thing I know, I smashed into her,” he said. Bracey then watched with horror, as his car was slowly sandwiched. “Seconds later, the car behind me smashed into me and then I’m pushed into her again,” he said. According to the drivers, the car wash then immediately shut off as they were escorted out of the tunnel. Bracey immediately dialed 911, as a Gwinnett County Police officer arrived on scene to review the footage from the car wash. Within the police report, the officer stated the following: “Within this footage, I observed vehicle one fail to go into neutral and observed the vehicle engage it’s breaks while moving through the car wash.” Yet, Ruiz claims the car wash had a major malfunction when it comes to an emergency shutoff. “If a vehicle jumps off track, then that’s something they might want to get fixed in their car wash to avoid this happening to other vehicles,” Ruiz said. Bracey is bracing for an expensive bill, as he takes his Porsche to a repair shop on Monday. He says Ruiz’s insurance company — Progressive — has asserted that the accident wasn’t her fault. Bracey also added that the general manager of Super Duck Car Wash hasn’t responded to his requested calls. “My message to everyone is to stay alert while going through a car wash,” he concluded. “Because sometimes, the car in front of you can completely go off track.” Copyright 2024 WANF.

The president’s comments came near the end of a commencement address in which he also reflected on American democracy and his role in safeguarding it. “It’s one of the hardest, most complicated problems in the world,” Biden said. “There’s nothing easy about it. I know it angers and frustrates many of you, including my family. But most of all I know it breaks your heart. It breaks mine as well.” To date, Biden had limited his public comments around the protests on U.S. college campuses to upholding the right to peaceful protest. The speech — and a separate one he gave later Sunday in Detroit — are part of a burst of outreach to Black constituents by the Democratic president, whose support among these voters has softened since their strong backing helped put him in the Oval Office. Biden spent much of the approximately 30-minute speech focused on the problems at home. He condemned Donald Trump’s rhetoric on immigrants and noted that the class of 2024 entered college during the COVID-19 pandemic and following the murder of George Floyd, a Black man killed by a Minneapolis police officer. Biden said it was natural for them, and others, to wonder whether the democracy “you hear about actually works for you.” “If Black men are being killed in the street. What is democracy?” he asked. “The trail of broken promises that still leave Black communities behind. What is democracy? If you have to be 10 times better than anyone else to get a fair shot.” Anti-war protests have roiled America’s college campuses. Columbia University canceled its main commencement ceremony. At Morehouse, the announcement that Biden would be the commencement speaker drew some backlash among the faculty and those who oppose the president’s handling of the war. Some Morehouse alumni circulated an online letter condemning administrators for inviting Biden and solicited signatures to pressure Morehouse President David Thomas to rescind it. The letter claimed that Biden’s approach to Israel amounted to support of genocide in Gaza and was out of step with the pacifism expressed by Martin Luther King Jr., Morehouse’s most famous graduate. The Hamas attack on southern Israel killed 1,200 people. Israel’s offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to health officials in the territory. In the end, there were no disruptions of Morehouse’s commencement while applause for Biden mostly was subdued. At least seven graduates and one faculty member sat with their backs turned during Biden’s address, and another student draped himself in a Palestinian flag. Protesters near the ceremony carried signs that said “Free Palestine,” “Save the Children’' and “Ceasefire Now” as police on bikes kept watch. On stage behind the president as he spoke, academics unfurled a Congolese flag. The African country has been mired in a civil war, and many racial justice advocates have called for greater attention to the conflict as well as American help in ending the violence. During his speech, valedictorian DeAngelo Jeremiah Fletcher, of Chicago, said it was his duty to speak on the war in Gaza and recognize that both Palestinians and Israelis have suffered. He called for an “immediate and permanent cease-fire in the Gaza Strip.” Graduate Kingsley John said, “the temperature on campus was expected given we had the president of the United States come and speak.” John said he stood “in solidarity” with his classmates and that Biden “seemed to be reflective and open to hear the feedback.” Morehouse awarded Biden an honorary doctor of laws degree. After accepting the honor, he joked that, “I’m not going home” as chants of “four more years” broke out in the audience. Biden then flew to Detroit to address thousands attending the local NAACP chapter’s annual Freedom Fund dinner. Georgia and Michigan are among a handful of states that will help decide November’s expected rematch between Biden and Trump. Biden narrowly won Georgia and Michigan in 2020 and he needs strong Black voter turnout in Atlanta and Detroit if he hopes to repeat in November. Biden spent part of the past week reaching out to Black constituents. He highlighted key moments in the Civil Rights Movement, from the 70th anniversary of the landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision in the case of Brown v. Board of Education that outlawed racial segregation in public schools to the Little Rock Nine, who helped integrate a public school in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1957. He also met with members of the “Divine Nine” Black fraternities and sororities. At the NAACP dinner, Biden told a largely Black crowd that numbered into the thousands that Trump wants to pardon those who were convicted of crimes during the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and calls them “patriots.” He suggested that Trump would not have been so kind had they been people of color. “Let me ask you, what do you think he would’ve done on Jan. 6 if Black Americans had stormed the Capitol?” Biden asked. “What do you think? I can only imagine.” Asked for a response, Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt blasted Biden’s remarks as “preposterous,” describing them as a “desperate” attempt to divert attention from Biden’s own record of weak poll numbers, high inflation and “violent protests and migrant crimes” across the country. The speech gave Biden a chance to reach thousands of people in Wayne County, which historically has voted overwhelmingly Democratic but has shown signs of resistance to his reelection bid. The county also holds one of the largest Arab American populations in the nation, predominantly in the city of Dearborn. Leaders there were at the forefront of an “uncommitted” effort that received over 100,000 votes in the state’s Democratic primary and spread across the country. A protest rally and march against Biden’s visit took place in Dearborn in the afternoon. In Detroit, guests at the NAACP dinner were met by over 200 pro-Palestinian protesters outside the entrance to the convention center. They waved Palestinian flags, held signs calling for a cease-fire and chanted “free, free Palestine.” “Until Joe Biden listens to his key constituents, he’s risking handing the presidency to Donald Trump,” said Lexi Zeidan, a protest leader who help spearhead a protest effort that resulted in over 100,000 people voting “uncommitted” in February’s Democratic primary. ___ Associated Press writers Joey Cappelletti in Lansing, Michigan, and Colleen Long and Mark Sherman in Washington contributed to this report.

(Atlanta News First) - President Joe Biden delivered Morehouse College’s commencement address Sunday morning. His speech spanned topics including democracy, racism, student debt, gun violence, the climate crisis and the Israel-Hamas war. Protests over the war have roiled America’s campuses, but there were no major disruptions at the Morehouse event, though applause for Biden’s remarks was muted. At least seven graduates and a faculty member sat with their backs turned during Biden’s address, and another student draped himself in a Palestinian flag. Some members of the graduating class showed support for Palestinians in Gaza by tying keffiyeh scarves around their shoulders on top of their black graduation robes. Protesters near the ceremony carried signs that said “Free Palestine,” “Save the Children” and “Ceasefire Now” as police on bikes kept watch. A group of demonstrators gathered at a park near Morehouse and marched to the campus, but disbanded soon after the commencement ceremony without major incidents. “Peaceful assembly is core to the Morehouse College social justice tradition. The Morehouse College administration fully supports and defends the right to peacefully protest and the expression of one’s views openly,” Morehouse College said in a statement. “Our faculty are some of the best social scholars that higher academia has to offer, and they are training up the world’s next generation of community and industry leaders who will continue our institution’s history-making legacy.” Biden was the second sitting American chief executive to deliver Morehouse’s commencement address. He follows in the footsteps of his former boss – then-President Barack Obama – who delivered the 2013 address. Sunday’s commencement was Morehouse’s 140th such graduation exercise. It was Biden’s second time delivering a commencement address to an HBCU. Last year, Biden spoke at Howard University, the alma mater of Vice President Kamala Harris.

Last month, Morehouse announced it had invited Biden to deliver the commencement address, but almost immediately after the announcement, students, faculty and alumni began expressing concern over Biden’s visit to the campus. On May 8, several students from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) gathered at Morehouse to protest Biden’s speech. The protesters said they disagreed with Biden’s support of Israel in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Some Morehouse alumni circulated an online letter condemning school administrators for inviting Biden and soliciting signatures to pressure Morehouse President David Thomas to rescind it. The letter claimed that Biden’s approach to Israel amounted to support of genocide in Gaza and was out of step with the pacifism expressed by Martin Luther King Jr., Morehouse’s most famous graduate. Last week, Morehouse faculty voted to give Biden the honorary degree he received after his remarks Sunday. Before the commencement, Thomas said that silent, non-disruptive protests would be tolerated, but repeated a pledge to halt the ceremony if disruptions mounted. Nearly all the streets around the campus were shut down for the event. As the packed crowd gathered just before graduates began filing into the quad, Associate Provost Mel Foster warned: “Although we respect everyone’s right to free speech, Morehouse College has issued guidelines to ensure we are in line with the law.” The White House had hinted that Biden would reference the concerns of students and faculty at the male-only, historically Black college over his approach to the war. Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, “stay tuned,” when asked if the Democratic president would address the worries that sparked weeks of student protests on college campuses nationwide. Jean-Pierre said Biden was looking forward to the speech, as he does all of his commencement addresses. He wrote the remarks himself, along with senior advisers, she said. “When it comes to this difficult moment in time that we’re in as we speak about the protests, he understands that there’s a lot of pain,” Jean-Pierre said. “He understands that people have a lot of opinions and he respects that folks have a lot of opinions.” This weekend also marked the president’s first visit back to the Peach State after a March campaign rally. Biden arrived at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport on Saturday. Several politicians, including Senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, Mayor Andre Dickens, Rep. Nikema Williams, Fulton County Commission Chairman Robb Pitts and more, greeted Biden on the tarmac. Several people who met him at the airport, including Warnock, are Morehouse alumni. Later Saturday, Biden attended a fundraiser and stopped at Mary Mac’s Tea Room, a Black-owned restaurant that opened nearly 80 years ago, to briefly address about 50 supporters. A 2024 Morehouse graduate introduced him. The president joked about being surrounded by “Morehouse Men.” RELATED: President Biden arrives in Atlanta ahead of campaign event, Morehouse commencement speech The president departed Atlanta around 11:30 a.m. Sunday for Detroit, where he planned to address an NAACP dinner.

(Atlanta News First) - President Joe Biden arrived in Atlanta on Saturday afternoon ahead of his scheduled commencement speech at Morehouse College. Air Force One touched down at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport at around 12:30 p.m. Several politicians, including Senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, Mayor Andre Dickens, Rep. Nikema Williams, Fulton County Commission Chairman Robb Pitts and more, greeted Biden on the tarmac before he left in a motorcade. Biden will attend an event for Black voters before delivering the speech at Morehouse Sunday morning, according to his campaign team. “We are not, and will not, parachute into these communities at the last minute, expecting their vote,” Trey Baker, senior advisor for the Biden-Harris campaign, said in a statement. “Every day, from now until election day, we will continue working diligently to ensure that come November, Black voters send Joe Biden and Kamala Harris back to the White House to continue delivering for Black America in unprecedented ways.” WATCH BIDEN’S FULL LANDING: Morehouse faculty voted to give Biden an honorary degree before his commencement speech. Several people who met him on the tarmac, including Warnock, are Morehouse alumni. But Biden’s upcoming appearance isn’t without controversy. On May 8, several students from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) gathered at Morehouse, a nationally acclaimed HBCU, to protest his speech. PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Morehouse students protest ahead of President Biden’s commencement speech The protestors said they disagree with Biden’s support of Israel in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. “While I understand why some of the older alumni might be excited by the amount of opportunity and press that this would bring to the institution, the general feeling on the ground is we don’t want him here,” a Morehouse student told Atlanta News First. “It’s very obvious that we are being used to score political points and try to get more Black votes.” The New Georgia Project Action Fund, an organization dedicated to increasing civic participation in minority groups, said it appreciates Biden’s visit. But Keron Blair, the nonprofit’s organizing and field officer, said Biden must give Black voters — especially Black men — reasons to vote for him. “As an HBCU graduate, a Black man, a Georgia voter, and someone who talks to Black Georgians every day, I’ll be watching the president’s speech closely,” Blair said in a statement. “He’s got five months to show us that he takes us seriously, and we will be watching with sample ballots in hand.” Biden’s visit marks the president’s first appearance in Atlanta since his March campaign rally. He also agreed to a debate with former President Donald Trump in Atlanta on June 27, which will air live on CNN. Copyright 2024 WANF.

Delegates at the convention in Columbus rendered a split decision, choosing Amy Kremer for one of the two RNC seats, but retaining incumbent Committeeman Jason Thompson. Kremer and other challengers argued that Thompson and Ginger Howard, the other incumbent, hadn’t done enough to support Donald Trump. They pointed out the continued desire of party activists for confrontation with internal and external enemies, even as many in leadership tried to preach unity and ease divisions that have left Republican Gov. Brian Kemp estranged from the party organization. “We need somebody willing to stand up and fight,” Kremer told delegates. “If you want the grassroots to have a voice, then you need to vote for change.” Kremer, who got her political start in the Tea Party movement, wasn’t part of the mob that stormed the Capitol as Congress met to certify Democrat Joe Biden’s election win. But it was her group that secured the permit for the “Save America” rally where Trump told the crowd to \" fight like hell.” She spoke at the event and was among the most active fundraisers in the “Stop the Steal” movement advancing the lie that Biden’s victory was stolen. Leaders of the party had recommended against electing Kremer, noting among other issues that she and an affiliated group have unpaid Federal Election Commission fines. Delegates reelected Thompson despite attacks saying his wife and daughter worked for Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, the Republican chief election official who defended the 2020 election result in Georgia that saw Biden capture the state’s 16 electoral votes. Raffensperger was repeatedly likened to the devil during the weekend convention. Thompson fell short of a majority in an initial three-candidate race but won in a runoff. “Together we will fight the forces that seek to destroy America,” Thompson told delegates. “Together we will win the state of Georgia for President Trump.” Most speakers called on Republicans to put their internal divisions behind them, including U.S. Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene, an unlikely messenger of GOP unity. Greene, who earned rebukes from other Republicans during her failed attempt to oust U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, told attendees at a party breakfast Saturday that “there’s nothing wrong with a little bit of arguing in the Republican Party” but those divisions should stop now. “If we’re too fractured, we can’t work together to hit that home run in November,” Greene said. “And that’s going to be a problem. If we’re too off in different directions, and not working together, we cannot hit that home run in November.” Greene, though, was speaking at a convention that was once again skipped by Gov. Brian Kemp, who created a rival fundraising and political operation after Trump attacked him for backing the 2020 election results. The fracture deepened when some party leaders supported former U.S. Sen. David Perdue’s unsuccessful, Trump-backed challenge to Kemp in 2022. There were some signs of unity. Two Kemp allies, Insurance Commissioner John King and state Rep. Tim Fleming, Kemp’s 2018 campaign manager, both spoke to the convention. So did a larger number of state lawmakers than last year. Party Chairman Josh McKoon, a former state senator, said that was part of his attempt fuse the party back together. “That’s another thing we’ve been working on, is our relationship with elected officials and kind of bringing everybody back to the table,” McKoon said. Republicans repeatedly said they believe inflation and immigration are the issues that will allow them to win over people who didn’t vote in 2020 or who voted for Biden. Georgia Labor Commissioner Bruce Thompson brandished his wallet during a Friday speech to tell delegates how to reach undecided voters. “Don’t pound them over abortion, don’t pound over things that maybe aren’t relevant,” Thompson said. “Pound them over what really matters, which is right here. This is relevant to every single American. It’s their pocketbook.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

A cultural treasure, if you will, lined with architecture and art. One that came to be due to the dream of a more perfect life known as the City Beautiful movement. The movement came to be in the 1890s in response to the accumulating dirt in industrial cities and the belief from advocates that better sanitation, parkways, civic art and improved circulation of traffic would make cities more profitable and harmonious. Architectural historian, former University of Pennsylvania professor and author of “Building the City Beautiful,” David Brownlee, said the goal of the movement was to create a new American aesthetic—from an industrial landscape to an urban paradise. Arguably the most beautiful thing to come from the movement is the Parkway. But the inspiration for such a thing wasn’t born in Philadelphia, in fact it came from almost 4,000 miles away in Paris. But it would be decades before that inspiration came to fruition. After the Civil War, Philadelphia was the largest industrial city in the nation and it had just created Fairmount Park, the biggest urban park in the world, Brownlee said. “And there was an immediate, almost immediate clamor to try to figure out a way to better connect this city to the park,” he said. The obvious idea he said was to build a boulevard and the model for that was the boulevards that had been built in Paris in the 1850s and 1860s. It was in 1907 when the demolition of 1600 buildings began with that of a little row home just west of where the Rodin Museum stands today. “A group of city dignitaries went up to the roof of this little row house and with a silver pick, removed the first brick with which the demolitions for the parkway began,” Brownlee said. The demolition took 10 years and when it was done it was quickly realized that the result was not the visual utopia Philadelphians were seeking. It was just an empty landscape. “That actually shows pretty well what the demolition zone looked like with the art museum under construction, and the demolition completed, really there’s nothing there,” Brownlee said. “What they did at one point, they sort of dressed it up with pergolas, on each side of it just to make it look a little less barren because there were no buildings.” It was that same year of 1917 when two French architects, Jacques Gréber and Paul Cret, collaborated and created what would be the inspiration for the Parkway. “In 1917, he (Gréber) and his staff in Paris produced a set of gigantic, intoxicatingly beautiful drawings that showed the Parkway, not as empty and not full of buildings, but lined by a precious necklace of small parks, tiny parks, each with a different character,” Brownlee said. While the Fairmount Park Commission gave Gréber money to make more plans, it was never adopted. But that idea of what the Parkway could be remained decade after decade. And the inspiration for the Parkway’s design came from a very similar stretch of Parisian boulevard in Paris, the Champs-Élysées. As the Benjamin Franklin Parkway ends with the Museum of Art the Champs-Élysées ends with the Arc de Triomphe. “It’s certainly the case that the Benjamin Franklin Parkway was inspired by that Parisian model and that set of Parisian models and the general notion that you could cut a boulevard through an existing city and open it up and change it. Change it from an industrial city to a capital of commerce and culture,” Brownlee said. While the plans for the Parkway were widely approved, it wasn’t until 1926 that they were completed, and the centerpiece of the City Beautiful movement no longer stood empty. How different would Philadelphia be today had that change not taken place? “Philadelphia would be a city that was row house neighborhoods and nothing but row house neighborhoods, because that’s literally what the Parkway was,” Brownlee said. “A classic North Philadelphia, South Philadelphia neighborhood and every couple blocks a factory.” Brownlee says as grand as it is, the beauty in the Parkway comes from its simplicity. “It had a simple and easily defined character that was very attractive, literally a straight line. A straight line that goes from one important place, City Hall Tower which was the tallest building in the world until 1908, to Fairmount Park, the largest park in the world and connected the two. How did it connect them? With a straight line, who could forget that idea?”","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/philadelphias-ben-franklin-parkway-and-how-it-was-inspired-by-paris-champs-elysees/3866147/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Philadelphia could be stopped from renewing lease on addiction center in Fairmount","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/philadelphia-nursing-home.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675","content":"The city of Philadelphia could be blocked from renewing the lease on a facility in Fairmount that has been used as a shelter. It's part of a bill that moved forward in city council on Wednesday. A committee approved the bill on Wednesday, sending it to the full council. This comes as the Parker administration has been working to address homelessness and addiction in the city. The full city council is set to take this up on Thursday with the earliest it could see final passage by council next week. The facility impacted by this is at 2100 West Girard Avenue and is the former Philadelphia Nursing Home that's been used as a shelter by the city for years. Managing Director Adam Thiel has said that the goal here was to expand capacity at the existing facility by 75 beds. Thiel said this is not one of the triage or wellness centers that the administration is planning for, but there have still been questions about how the larger plan will work. The president of the Fairmount Civic Association Tim Butters told NBC10 about his experience testifying in favor of the bill and how by doing that, they're hoping for more transparency and a voice in what happens there. \"I think we would like a concrete plan for what exact service they’re providing what they’re plans are in the future and what services they’re going to provide in our neighborhood to make sure that whatever goes on in the facility doesn’t impact the neighborhood safety,\" Butters explained. The bill would prevent the city from renewing the lease at that facility in the Fairmount neighborhood. \"The legislation before you today does not align with the administration’s vision and commitment to provide long-term care, treatment, and housing to our most vulnerable residents who are struggling with homelessness and addiction,\" Philadelphia's Deputy Managing Director for General Services David Wilson said in a written testimony. \"We must ensure that the Mayor and City Council, presently and in the future, have every available resource at their disposal to respond to any unprecedented challenge facing the city of Philadelphia.\" NBC10 has reached out to the city to get their reaction to this bill moving forward and was told that written testimony serves as their statement on this. The full council will have the first reading of the bill at Thursday's council meeting.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/fairmount-rehab-cherelle-parker-plans-blocked/3866101/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"‘Absolute tragedy': 2 dead, 3 hurt in Chester workplace shooting","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Chester-police-shooting.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675","content":"At least two workers were killed and three others were hurt in a workplace shooting at a family-owned linen business in Chester, Pennsylvania, Wednesday, Delaware County authorities said. Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer referred to the shooting as \"an absolutely tragedy.\" \"This is a story that plays out too often across the United States of America,\" Stollsteimer said at a morning news conference. \"A disgruntled employee has walked into a linen shop -- the Delaware County Linen shop behind us -- and shot five people, five co-workers.\" Officers were dispatched to Delaware County Linen on West 4th Street -- near Hayes Street -- around 8:30 a.m., Delaware County dispatchers said. The family-owned company is a linen-rental and laundry services company that has been in business since 1988, according to its website. It mainly serves restaurants, country clubs, hotels and other businesses in Pennsylvania and some neighboring states. Stollsteimer said that at least five people -- including the gunman's supervisor -- were shot and two had died after showing up for work. “People who are victims of this shooting today, they came to work to live the American dream,\" Stollsteimer said. \"They came to work to work hard, play by the rules and to get ahead in their lives.\" The shooting took place inside and outside the business and a handgun was used, investigators said. Francisco Kenty, a Chester resident, told NBC10 he fled to check on his family member when the shots were fired. \"I ran back inside. I was making sure my grandmother was alright,\" he said. Kenty also said he saw one of the shooting victims. \"He was just laying on the ground,\" Kenty said. \"He wasn't moving. Wasn't anything. He was just laying on the ground.\" Chester officers rushed one of the shooting victims to the hospital. Stollsteimer asked for people to pray for the three injured people at the hospital. A family member of one of the injured victims told NBC10 their loved one is expected to survive. An employee who was inside the business at the time of the shooting told NBC10's Rosemary Connors the gunfire came as a surprise. Many people work early hours at the business. Stollsteimer said that though the suspected shooter -- an \"angry\" worker -- had issues and confrontations with colleagues in the past, including on Tuesday and early Wednesday before the incident, there were no signs pointing to the shooting taking place. \"This is just a horrible tragedy that this whole community now is feeling,\" Stollsteimer said. The suspected shooter -- who works at the shop -- was taken into police custody, the DA said, while noting the threat no longer existed. Police from nearby Trainer, Pennsylvania, stopped the shooter's car after a description of the suspect's vehicle was released, according to Chester Police Commissioner Steven Gretsky. \"I want to commend Trainer Police Department because the actor did attempt to flee, which they did stop him and again, he is in custody,\" Gretsky said. The large police presence continued in the area throughout the day. Officers with guns drawn could be seen opening doors to the business in the minutes after the shooting. The suspect is currently being held at the Chester City Police Department headquarters. Charges are pending as the investigation continues. The shooting occurred amid a 68% decrease in homicides by guns over the past four years in Chester, according to the Delaware County District Attorney's Office. \"We will continue to do the work we do every single day to try to keep the community safe,\" Stollsteimer said. \"Today is a tragedy. This could happen in any community across America and increasingly does happen in all kinds of communities across America.\" City council members described Chester as a tightknit community and said they were heartbroken by the deadly shooting. \"We just like to remember that Chester is a great place,\" Adolphus Adams, a Chester resident, told NBC10. \"Don't believe always the hype.\" Chester Mayor Stefan Roots said Delaware County Linen was a fixture in the community for the past 30 years and had never had any issues prior to Wednesday's shooting. \"Chester, Pennsylvania, never expected to be the epicenter of another episode of workplace violence,\" Mayor Roots said. \"You have to anticipate that their had to be some type of mental health issue that would have an employee walk into his workplace on a day of work and take out his anger in such a violent way.\" Mayor Roots and city councilmembers told NBC10 the White House reached out to offer support and make them aware that they're following the situation. The Chester Community Coalition is also offering support and grief counseling for anyone impacted. “We want the community to know that we’re here to support them,\" Chester Deputy Mayor Portia West said. \"It is all of our problem when we have gun-related issues affecting our community.\"","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/chester-shooting-business/3865307/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Daily marijuana use outpaces daily drinking in the US, a new study says","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2019/09/ddaef754c20444e4b3af1b7e6323e07c.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=320%2C180","content":"Millions of people in the U.S. report using marijuana daily or nearly every day, according to an analysis of national survey data, and those people now outnumber those who say they are daily or nearly daily drinkers of alcohol. Alcohol is still more widely used, but 2022 was the first time this intensive level of marijuana use overtook daily and near-daily drinking, said the study’s author, Jonathan Caulkins, a cannabis policy researcher at Carnegie Mellon University. “A good 40% of current cannabis users are using it daily or near daily, a pattern that is more associated with tobacco use than typical alcohol use,” Caulkins said. The research, based on data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, was published Wednesday in the journal Addiction. The survey is a highly regarded source of self-reported estimates of tobacco, alcohol and drug use in the United States. In 2022, an estimated 17.7 million people reported using marijuana daily or near-daily compared to 14.7 million daily or near-daily drinkers, according to the study. From 1992 to 2022, the per capita rate of reporting daily or near-daily marijuana use increased 15-fold. Caulkins acknowledged in the study that people may be more willing to report marijuana use as public acceptance grows, which could boost the increase. Most states now allow medical or recreational marijuana, though it remains illegal at the federal level. In November, Florida voters will decide on a constitutional amendment allowing recreational cannabis, and the federal government is moving to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug. Research shows that high-frequency users are more likely to become addicted to marijuana, said Dr. David A. Gorelick, a psychiatry professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study. The number of daily users suggests that more people are at risk for developing problematic cannabis use or addiction, Gorelick said. “High frequency use also increases the risk of developing cannabis-associated psychosis,” a severe condition where a person loses touch with reality, he said.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/daily-marijuana-use-outpaces-daily-drinking-in-us/3865616/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Boy, 11, shoots at Bucks County home, police say","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2023/11/GettyImages-160324707.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675","content":"An 11-year-old boy who was walking home from school pulled out a gun and fired at a house in Bucks County, police said. On Tuesday, May 21, at 4:08 p.m., Bristol Township Police responded to a home on the 100 block of Goldenridge Drive in Levittown after a bullet struck a wall inside a bedroom. No one inside the home was injured. Investigators determined an 11-year-old boy was the person who shot at the home. The boy was walking home from Ben Franklin Middle School on 6400 Millcreek Road, less than a half a mile away from the house on Goldenridge Drive, when the shooting took place, investigators said. Police spent hours speaking with neighbors, checking homes and a grassy area on the street. Police later recovered the weapon, a 380-caliber handgun, around 9 p.m. that night, according to officials. Both police and school administrators are now investigating whether or not the boy brought the gun to school earlier in the day. The boy is currently under supervision at the Bucks County Youth Center. There was an increased police presence at Bristol Township School District schools on Wednesday as a precaution. Ben Franklin Middle School also had remote learning on Wednesday. \"The student who fired the gun has been identified and has been immediately removed from school. This disciplinary process for long-term suspension/expulsion will be initiated,\" a Bristol Township School District spokesperson wrote. \"The investigation into this incident is continuing by law enforcement. Since it is an evolving situation involving juveniles, we cannot say much at the time, but will provide updates when available and appropriate.\" The spokesperson also wrote that the shooting was an “isolated, non-targeted incident” and that there are no active threats against any school in the district. In light of this incident, police are warning any youth about guns and gun safety. “It’s very important that if you see something that doesn’t seem right to you, to report it to a teacher, report it to a principal, your guidance counselor and ultimately let the police department know,\" Bristol Township police Sgt. Jason Mancuso said. “They shouldn’t have guns first of all. You should let your parents know. You need to get on the right track with your life.

Phil Murphy, has seen all of the charges dropped. In an interview with NBC10's Brian Sheehan, Frank Trumbetti of Williamstown, who initially co-owned Atilis Gym in Bellmawr with Ian Smith of Delanco Township, said all the charges he and Smith faced -- including opening a non-essential business amid the pandemic, creating a public nuisance and related charges -- were dropped on Tuesday. \"It’s just been a long time coming,\" Trumbetti said. Trumbetti said that a judge dropped all charges and 80 summons that the owners faced after they opened amid the pandemic. The court's decision comes nearly four years after the pair was arrested and charged for defying New Jersey's state order that prohibited businesses that were deemed non-essential, from operating at the height of the pandemic. The gym initially closed in March of 2020 due to this regulation. However, it reopened two months later -- and remained open -- despite repeated court orders for the gym to shutdown. \"1,528 days ago, they actually shut us down, asked for 14 days to flatten the curve,\" Trumbetti recalled. \"When we opened up, we felt like we were doing something to help people.” Trumbetti said that the ruling was made on April 24th, however the state had a week to appeal. Now, that week has passed. “It’s a big relief because it’s been held over our heads for over four years and now at least I don’t have to worry coming at me for that,\" Trumbetti said. The charges were the first in what was a long-running dispute that's played out mostly in verbal sparring between New Jersey officials, including Gov. Murphy, and the two co-owners. At one point, the gym was shutdown by the state's health department, as well. “I took it upon myself because everything I’ve worked for and how you gonna tell me I can’t go to work but I need to pay my bills? I mean, we didn’t qualify for any of the PPE money,\" argued Trumbetti in discussing his decision to push back against the shutdown order. Overall, Trumbetti said his gym paid about $269,000 in fines and court fees before the charges were ultimately dropped. But, he said, his fight isn't over yet. “I want someone to be held accountable for it, what they’ve done. Because everything that we said from day one has been validated,\" he said. NBC10 has reached out to courts as well as the Attorney General's Office for comment on this case. However, these offices have not returned a request for comment.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/nj-gym-owner-pandemic-lockdown-cleared/3865606/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Man left seriously hurt in East Mount Airy shooting, suspect turned himself in","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/pickering-shooting-2.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=320%2C180","content":"Police in Philadelphia are investigating after a man was seriously hurt in a shooting on Wednesday afternoon, officials said.

The lawsuits describe how 66 people, now adults, say they were victimized by guards, nurses, supervisors and others. Some attacks were reported to other staffers and were ignored or met with disbelief, the lawsuits allege. Their claims point to a broken juvenile justice system in Pennsylvania, said Jerome Block, a New York lawyer whose firm filed the new cases and is helping pursue similar lawsuits in Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey and Michigan. “The purpose of the juvenile justice system is to rehabilitate and educate and reform, to equip them to lead healthy, productive lives,” Block said in a phone interview before filing the suits. “Instead these men and women were sexually traumatized as children. They came to these facilities needing help. Instead, they had trauma inflicted upon them.” The lawsuits involve the Loysville Youth Development Center, the South Mountain Secure Treatment Unit and the North Central Secure Treatment Unit in Danville, all under the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services; Merakey USA’s Northwestern Academy outside Shamokin, which closed in 2016; and facilities run by Tucson, Arizona-based VisionQuest National Ltd. and Villanova-based Devereux Advanced Behavioral Health. Copies of the lawsuit were emailed Wednesday morning, seeking comment, to spokespeople for the Department of Human Services, Devereux and Merakey. Several messages were left in recent days for VisionQuest. All of those who are suing were born after Nov. 26, 1989, and meet the state's legal standards for filing claims of sexual abuse when they were children. Block said the legal team also represents more than 100 people who were similarly abused, but too long ago under time limits to file civil claims. Proposals to open a two-year window for such outdated claims have been blocked by Senate Republicans in the General Assembly. Eighteen of the latest plaintiffs describe rapes and other sexual abuse at Devereux facilities. One man says that when he was 14, while sedated during “major anger outbreaks,” a staff member sexually abused him while he was restrained “so he could not fight back.” Other claims, by 15 people who were confined at facilities run by the Department of Human Services, say children there “have long been subjected to a culture of exploitation, violence and rampant sexual abuse\" committed by guards, counselors and other staff. “The sexual abuse at commonwealth juvenile detention facilities has ranged from inappropriate strip searches to rape using violent physical force,” according to their lawsuit, which alleges negligence and failed oversight. One of the plaintiffs says she became pregnant as a teenager as the result of a violent rape by a counselor at North Central about 20 years ago, and that another staffer didn’t believe her when she reported the rape. The lawsuit doesn't describe what happened regarding her pregnancy. Merakey USA, which operated Northwestern Academy before it shut down in 2016, is accused of a “culture of sexual abuse and brutality,” including “inappropriate and criminal sexual relationships with children,” who were granted or denied privileges to pressure them into sex. That lawsuit says one 14-year-old girl who had not been sexually active was forced into sex acts by two Northwestern Academy staffers. A male therapist then had her write about her sexual encounters during twice-a-week sessions for five months, telling her it was treatment for sex addiction and for a book he was writing. When she asked for the book upon leaving the facility, its director told her the book did not exist and her experience \"would not be considered mental health treatment,” the lawsuit said.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/lawsuits-claim-66-people-abused-children-pennsylvania-juvenile-facilities/3865575/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Remains found in NJ creek identified as man reported missing in 1982","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2022/03/CAUTION-TAPE.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=320%2C180","content":"The remains found submerged in a creek in New Jersey have been identified as those of a man missing since 1982, the local prosecutor's office said.

According to the Coatesville Police Department, on Tuesday, the homeowners - a man and a woman - were asleep in their Coatesville City home before they were awakened by a noise from the kitchen around 3:30 a.m. Police said one of the homeowners encountered a man - later identified as George Parks, 40, of Coatesville - and began fighting. They fought for several minutes before Parks overtook the homeowner with a firearm, police said. The other homeowner tried to help by grabbing a firearm from the home they had for protection, but Parks overpowered them and took the gun, according to police. Police said the homeowners were held captive for over two hours while Parks ransacked the residence. Parks had beaten one of the homeowners multiple times with his own firearm and threatened them both at gunpoint demanding money over the course of those hours, police said. Police said it wasn't until 6 a.m. that Parks left the home with U.S. currency and the homeowner's firearm. On Wednesday at 1:16 a.m. Parks was arrested in front of his residence in the 600 block of Lincoln Highway, according to police. He was still in possession of a stolen firearm from the victim's residence.

On Tuesday night, less than three weeks after the UMC repealed its anti-LGBTQ bans, she was reinstated. In a closed meeting of clergy from the UMC's Eastern Pennsylvania region, Stroud exceeded the two-thirds vote requirement to be readmitted as a full member and pastor in the UMC. Bishop John Schol of Eastern Pennsylvania welcomed the outcome, stating, “I’m grateful that the church has opened up to LGBTQ persons.” Stroud was brought into the meeting room after the vote, overcome with emotion. \"I was completely disoriented,” she told The Associated Press via email. “For what felt like several minutes I couldn’t tell where the front of the room was, where I was, where I needed to go. Everyone was clapping and then they started singing. The bishop asked me quietly if I wanted to say anything and I said I couldn’t.” She was handed the red stole that designates a fully ordained member of the clergy and joined her colleagues in a procession into a worship service. Earlier this month, delegates at a major UMC conference in Charlotte, North Carolina, struck down longstanding anti-LGBTQ policies and created a path for clergy ousted because of them to seek reinstatement. Stroud — even while recalling how her 2004 ouster disrupted her life — chose that path, though some other past targets of UMC discipline chose otherwise. At 54, Stroud doesn’t plan a return to full-time ministry — at least not immediately. Now completing a three-year stint teaching writing at Princeton University, she is excited to be starting a new job this summer as assistant professor of Christian history at the Methodist Theological School in Ohio — one of 13 seminaries run by the UMC. Yet even with the new teaching job, Stroud wanted to regain the options available to an ordained minister as she looks for a congregation to join near the Delaware, Ohio, campus. When Stroud finally made her decision, she knew it was the right one. But the decision did not come easily as she followed the UMC’s deliberations on the anti-LGBTQ policies. “The first thing I felt was just anger — thinking about the life I could have had,” she told the AP at the time. “I loved being a pastor. I was good at it. With 20 more years of experience, I could have been very good — helped a lot of people and been very fulfilled.” Instead of pastoring, she spent several years in graduate schools, while earning modest income in temporary, non-tenured academic jobs. There were challenges, including a bout with cancer and divorce from her wife, although they proceeded to co-parent their daughter, who was born in 2005. Had she not been defrocked, Stroud said, “My whole life would have been different.” The process that led to Stroud’s ouster began in April 2003, when she told her congregation, the First United Methodist Church of Germantown, about her same-sex relationship. The church — where Stroud had been a pastor for four years — set up a legal fund to assist with her defense and hired her as a lay minister after she was defrocked. The UMC says it has no overall figures of how many clergy were defrocked for defying anti-LGBTQ bans or how many reinstatements might occur.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/defrocked-in-2004-for-same-sex-relationship-a-faithful-methodist-is-reinstated-as-pastor/3865028/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Embattled Pa.

However, late last month, that warrant was dropped after, District Attorney Larry Krasner said, his office learned that the PFA was no longer in effect. Boyle, 45, lost his reelection campaign in the Democratic primaries to challenger, Sean Dougherty. In the run on to last month's elections, Boyle faced concerns from fellow lawmakers -- including from his brother, Pennsylvania Rep.

The report found that while the state police regularly issued lengthy reports on racial profiling, “leaders never meaningfully grappled with certain data trends that indicated persistent, adverse treatment of racial and ethnic minority motorists,” the comptroller's office said. “The fact that for years the State Police was aware of data showing disparate treatment of people of color on our roads — yet took no action to combat those trends — shows that the problems run deeper than previously realized,\" Acting State Comptroller Kevin Walsh said in a statement. The report comes as part of the state comptroller's mandate under a 2009 law to conduct an annual review of the state police and its Office of Law Enforcement Professional Standards. It also follows a 2023 report commissioned by the state attorney general that found evidence of discrimination against Black and Latino drivers. The professional standards office told the comptroller it repeatedly requested that state police offer any “organizational, environmental, or contextual” information to explain these trends. But “most times” state police offered little information or limited responses, according to the comptroller. In a statement, Attorney General Matt Platkin, who oversees the state police, said he reviewed the report and called many of its findings “inexcusable and deeply troubling.” “It is not acceptable for a modern law enforcement agency to ignore the impact bias and implicit bias have on all professions — including law enforcement,” Platkin said. The state police said they are committed to accountability and public trust, according to a statement from Sgt. Charles Marchan. Marchan said the force had “exceeded mandated requirements” and met requests from the attorney general's office as well. “As information technology improves in our modern digital era, the New Jersey State Police continues to improve and update our capabilities on how data is collected and analyzed,” he said. New Jersey State Police were under federal supervision stemming from racial profiling allegations on state highways for a decade until 2009, when the state came up with policies aimed at continuing oversight and ending discriminatory policing during traffic stops.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/nj-state-police-never-meaningfully-grappled-discriminatory-practices-official/3864550/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Suspected shooter jumps from 4th floor after killing teen in Roxborough apartment, police say","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Roxborough-apartment-shooting-522.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675","content":"A man shot a teenager who intervened in a domestic dispute inside a Roxborough apartment then jumped off a 4th-story balcony, Philadelphia police said.

Cory Booker said at a Senate judiciary subcommittee hearing on prison labor Tuesday. America locks up more people than almost any other country in the world — nearly 2 million — and they are disproportionately people of color. Those who refuse to work can be punished, including being thrown into solitary confinement, Booker noted. And those injured or killed often do not have access to most basic rights and protections guaranteed to other American workers. “Our prisons should reflect the best of who we are, they should reflect our values,” the New Jersey Democrat said. “And they should, in my strong opinion, be places that are not just for punishment, but for rehabilitation and for creating roads of redemption.” While most incarcerated workers today help maintain correctional facilities, others are leased out to private companies or take part in work-release programs. Companies such as McDonald’s, KFC, Walmart, Cargill and Tyson Foods have benefited from the multibillion-dollar industry, The Associated Press found as part of an ongoing two-year investigation into how prison labor is quietly entering the supply chains of some of America’s most recognized companies and brands. Booker, chair of the Senate’s subcommittee on criminal justice and counterterrorism, was speaking during a hearing aimed at looking at ways to rethink prison labor, from making jobs voluntary and boosting wages to protecting workers against injuries and abuse. Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas pushed back, saying prisoners are dangerous people housed in dangerous facilities where “idle hands are the devil’s workshop.” He added that prison labor is a way for inmates to give something back to the society they wronged. “And if that means scrubbing toilets, mopping floors or picking up the garbage,\" he said, “then so be it.” American prisoners were being put to work in the early 1800s, but the practice ramped up after the Civil War with the passage of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which contained a loophole. It ended slavery for everyone except those convicted of a crime. For decades after emancipation, Black men were rounded up — often for petty crimes — and put to work under brutal conditions during the convict leasing era. It lined the coffers of industrial giants such as U.S. Steel and Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company, while helping to rebuild the South’s broken economy. Andrea Armstrong, a law professor at Loyola University New Orleans, said incarcerated workers are sometimes given dangerous assignments with little or no training, leading in some cases to painful and lifelong, debilitating injuries, and even death. That, she said, was never intended to be part of their sentence. She listed a number of prisoners who have died preventable deaths while working behind bars, while also highlighting work by the AP. “Refusing to work in dangerous conditions could even lead to new criminal charges and new sentences in some states,” she said. “And we, the general public, have no idea because this forced labor occurs in spaces that lack oversight, transparency and accountability.”","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/politics/sen-cory-booker-questions-us-prison-labor-policies-calls-for-change/3865048/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Trenton urges testing for children at lead contaminated school","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Hundreds-of-students-being-tested-for-lead-after-EPA-finds-contamination-at-a-school-in-Trenton.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675","content":"Out of its parks. Out of people's homes. Out of its schools. And, to step up that effort, officials have announced the next step they are taking -- offering testing for kids who might have been exposed to the poisonous chemical. In January, the federal government stepped in to start finding elevated levels of lead around Trenton. And, in April, the city responded to those findings by closing parts of three parks in order to deal with the issue. Now – officials have shifted their focus to testing 600 students from one school that, city officials said, has been contaminated. “Then they put padding down, they’re putting mulch down and laying blacktop over top of it,\" said Melanie Bajek, parent of a student at Grant Intermediate School in Trenton. \"But I don’t know how that’s going to help –they didn’t say how it’s going to prevent the lead from seeping up in the ground again.” Bajek said that she is worried that the work being done to remove led from her son's school might not be enough to ensure that he is healthy. He's one of the 600 students at Grant Intermediate School that city officials are urging to get tested for lead exposure after the EPA found high levels in the lead in the area. “I just think if something happens to our kids at any point, they’re going to try to say that the exposure happened at home instead of at the school,\" said Bajek. Officials have told NBC10 that people can get their homes tested for free, and if high levels of lead are found there, the city's health department will begin the process of removing it. It's an effort that Trenton's mayor, Reed Gusciora, pushed in a speech on Tuesday. “We’re testing people’s yards, we’re testing schools, we’re testing parks,\" Gusciora said. “But also, we have these old homes that have lead-based paints on the walls. Kids get serious, they put the chips of the paint in their mouths.” He said that employees of the city's health department will be walking door-to-door throughout the city's North Ward section to offer parents free testing for kids who go to Grant Intermediate School “Take a look at the shirt. We all are going to be coordinated with these shirts,\" the mayor said, sharing a look at an employee's outfit. \"So that they know that we are the folks that are coming to knock the doors for lead.” On April, the city closed off grass areas at Sony Vereen Playground, Breunig Avenue Park and Grant Avenue Playground after the EPA found high levels of lead in the soil at these locations. “Lead poisoning is irreversible. So we are trying to do all that we can before we get to that point,\" said Yvette Graffie-Cooper, Trenton's Public Health Officer. Officials blame Trenton's century-old history with pottery factories that used lead paint as a big part of the reason high-levels of lead can still be found in soil throughout the city. And, officials said, they can't change the past, but they want to work to ensure that they can make the environment safer for the next generation. “My kids are going to a different school next year because I don’t like what goes on—it’s a quick fix and our kids are the ones suffering at the end of the day because they’re the ones being exposed to it,\" said Bajek. Darlene McKnight Elementary school was also tested by the EPA and there were no high levels of lead found there. However, officials said, the overall process of getting the lead out of Trenton could take years.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/trenton-testing-children-lead-contaminated-school/3865243/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Trial of NJ Sen. Bob Menendez takes weeklong break after jurors get stuck in elevator","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/AP24142786304555.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=320%2C180","content":"The trial of Sen. Bob Menendez grinded to a weeklong break on Tuesday after federal court jurors who were treated to a brick-by-brick build of the prosecution's bribery case got stuck in an elevator a day after they were forced from their usual assembly room because of flooding. Judge Sidney H. Stein said jurors were trapped in an elevator for several minutes during what was supposed to be a 10-minute late-afternoon break that lasted almost a half hour. The elevator breakdown came as jurors were shuttled between floors to an assembly room because carpeting in their usual assembly room just outside the courtroom was found to be soaked on Monday after somebody left sink faucets on over the weekend. As jurors left for the day, Stein humorously warned them: “Don't all get into one elevator.” The mishap came on a day when prosecutors slowly tried to build their case against the Democrat with evidence they hoped would score points with jurors against Menendez and his two co-defendants — two New Jersey businessmen who the government claims paid him bribes consisting of gold bars, hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and a car. Lawyers for Menendez, 70, of Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, and the businessmen say their clients are not guilty and that the government is trying to turn common interactions between a politician and his constituents into crimes. Among the witnesses Tuesday was a man who worked for the State Department during the years when prosecutors say Menendez used his powerful post as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to do favors for Egypt so he could keep the flow of bribes on track. Joshua Paul, who now works as a consultant for a nonprofit, testified that the committee and its chairperson have extraordinary powers over the State Department because it controls its leadership, dictates how it operates and confirms ambassadors worldwide. After his arrest last fall, Menendez was forced to step down from the post, though he has resisted calls for him to leave the Senate. Prosecutors say Menendez did things benefitting Egyptian officials so that he could receive bribes in exchange for clearing the way for one codefendant to secure a lucrative monopoly to certify that meat exported to Egypt from U.S. slaughterhouses met Islamic dietary requirements. Besides bribery, extortion, fraud and obstruction of justice, Menendez is also charged with acting as a foreign agent of Egypt.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/politics/trial-of-nj-sen-bob-menendez-takes-weeklong-break-after-jurors-get-stuck-in-elevator/3864910/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"2 dead, others hurt in fiery crash that shut down I-80","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/IMG_0718.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=0px%2C606px%2C4032px%2C2268px&resize=1200%2C675","content":"A major crash involving a jackknifed tractor-trailer and a box truck snarled traffic on I-80 in New Jersey for miles early Wednesday, authorities say.

It's an adaptive bicycle that was custom-made for him for his special challenges. His mom tried to get the bike back and is now asking for the public's help to track it down. On Thursday, Paula Broody saw a group of young men riding bicycles on Governor Printz Boulevard near Claymont, Delaware, and quickly realized they were her bikes. \"I approached the individuals, hit the horn, they dropped the bikes and ran away,\" Broody said. She got a video of the guys as they took off in the direction of Interstate 495. She said she was happy they didn't put up a fight and that they just left the bikes, especially her son Bryce's three-wheeler that was donated and customized specifically for him. But, the story doesn't end here. Bryce's bike was just too big to throw in the back of the car, so Broody came up with plan B. Since she didn't have a way to get it home, she stashed it in a wooded area. By the time she was able to go back and retrieve it, it was gone once again. \"It took me ten minutes,\" she said. \"By the time I came back to the main road, Bryce's bike was gone.\" She can't be sure if the original thieves came back and took it again, or if someone else decided to snatch the bike. Either way, it belongs to her son Bryce. The family isn't even focused on the thieves, it's all about the bike. The bicycle is a yellow three-wheeled tricycle with a wire basket in the back that has red reflectors. If you see the bike or know who has it, please call New Castle County police. \"The bikes are something that he was able to work safety, social skills and make some friends. It was a really cool bike. People would approach him and say, 'Hi Bryce, how you doing?' It gave him an opportunity to be part of the community,\" his mom said. The non-profit that originally gave Bryce the bike is no longer operating, but the founder says she can try to find him a new bike if his big yellow buddy doesn't show up soon.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/adaptive-bike-stolen-delaware/3864768/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"More Jersey Shore towns ban tents on the beach for this summer","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/beach.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675","content":"Make your own shade at the Jersey Shore, but not too much of it. People hitting the sand in some popular shore destinations in New Jersey will find new rules that ban tents, canopies and similar large structures. Officials say that disappearing beaches are the main reason why. Lifeguards in North Wildwood are sprucing up their stands before they hit the beach this summer season and they'll be watching for anyone who shows up with a structure that has now been banned. “Right now it's just that we just don't have the space,\" North Wildwood beach patrol chief Bill Ciavarelli said. Severe erosion is what prompted the city to ban beach tents, canopies and cabanas in guarded areas while it waits for a major beach replenishment project to begin in the coming weeks. \"Our biggest concern is any kind of medical emergency,\" Chief Ciavarelli said. “We got to somehow get through this crowd with very little beach to get to people.” In some areas at high tide, there's hardly any sand to sit on. “We're really just trying to make as much beach available as possible to as many people,\" North Wildwood mayor Patrick Rosenello explained. Brick Township, NJ, is also putting similar beach restrictions in place for the summer of 2024. Officials say a long-awaited replenishment project is still months away for their beach. “The size of our real estate has been shrinking and we want to make sure that we get the most bang for our buck for all the people who would like to come to the beach,\" Brick Township mayor Lisa Crate told NBC10. Meanwhile, at Island Beach State Park, a new ban on tents and canopies in swimming areas is expected to take effect in time for Memorial Day weekend. Officials say when there's lightning in the area, the structures make it difficult for park staffers to quickly clear people off the beaches. North Wildwood officials do not expect the ban to be permanent. But exactly how long it will remain in place, they say, will depend on the size of the beach. \"We are very hopeful that this beach replenishment is going to be a big success. It's going to create significant room on our beach,\" mayor Rosenello said. “It looks like by July 4, we should be able to revisit this.” Standard, single-pole umbrellas are still okay on beaches where the summer season will begin with sitting room in very short supply.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/more-jersey-shore-towns-ban-tents-canopies-beach/3864719/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"America's 250th birthday party starts early in Philly.

City and state leaders -- including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Lt. Gov. Austin Davis -- joined Visit Philadelphia leaders in front of the large Ben Franklin Statue at the Franklin Institute to preview the slate of activities celebrating America’s 250th birthday on Tuesday, May 21, 2024. They also highlighted the business benefits of all the tourism. “Philadelphia is the birthplace of American democracy and has been the leading destination for advocates, innovators, and leaders since the first Continental Congress — and that long tradition continues through to today,” Shapiro said. \"As our nation prepares to celebrate its 250th anniversary in 2026, Philadelphia and the entire Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will be the place to be. From the TED Democracy Series starting this summer to the FIFA World Cup and the MLB All Star Game, the Commonwealth is ready to host millions of visitors and show off our incredible towns and cities, like Philadelphia, to the world.\" The Philadelphia 250 fun gets started more than two years ahead of July 4, 2026. The planning process, however, began 13 years earlier with businessman Sam Katz and former Gov. Ed Rendell laying the groundwork for the celebration, Visit Philadelphia President and CEO Angela Val told the crowd. \"We kick off what is going to be an exciting and engaging and entertaining two years celebrating our country and Philadelphia's role in the birth of this great nation,\" Val said. Some of the future fun was already known, including the 2026 MLB All-Star game being hosted by the Phillies at Citizens Bank Park and Lincoln Financial Field hosting FIFA World Cup games, but other events were revealed Tuesday. Some of the other events include Young People's Declaration's Journey, the 250th birthday of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, ArtPhilly What Now and 52 Weeks of Firsts. The annual Wawa Welcome America Festival will also play a critical role in Independence Day festivities in the years ahead, organizers said. The fun starts this summer, with the first 2026 event set for July 2, 2024. Here's some of the events already being featured. Starting as soon as July 2, 2024 and continuing through 2026, Philadelphia’s semiquincentennial line-up includes: 2026 organizers said for people to expect more events to be announced in the months ahead. Shapiro noted how this two-year celebration can spotlight and highlight the best that the region has to offer. He and others also spotlighted a TED Democracy series that focuses on the struggles and triumphs. \"This gives us a chance to celebrate Philadelphia, to celebrate Pennsylvania, to celebrate this inclusive and tolerant place that we have strived to build, to pick up on the work that Franklin started,\" Shapiro -- a first-term Democrat -- told the crowd. The TED programs will be spread out in a series of chats. \"Together, through a multi-year program, TED and Visit Philadelphia will honor the critical role of Philadelphia in the founding of the United States, and we are doing this in the lead up to America's very special 250th anniversary in 2026,\" TED Conferences CEO and Executive Director Jay Herratti said. Philadelphia is leaning in on the 250th birthday celebration since the Declaration of Independence was crafted in Old City's Independence Hall and Revolutionary leaders had connections to the city. The Semiquincentennial is about looking forward to the next 250 years of American democracy, as well. “Philadelphia has a bold vision for 2026 as a historic opportunity to help define the next 250 years in America,” Michael Newmuis, 2026 director for the city of Philadelphia, said. “Our milestone events will not only further position Philadelphia on the national stage — they will establish Philadelphia as America’s new front door where folks from across the world will arrive and experience the best of our great nation and its future.”","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/america-250th-anniversary-philadelphia/3863989/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Here's the ‘Hot Fuss' with The Killers rocking NJ this summer","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/GettyImages-1439414255.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=320%2C180","content":"\"Somebody Told Me\" The Killers are coming back to the Philadelphia region.

On Monday, the Pennsylvania SPCA's Animal Law Enforcement team - who had been contacted by the Pennsylvania State Police on behalf of Coaldale Borough Police - rescued 15 Great Pyrenees-type dogs, two collie-type dogs, two birds, and a turtle from a property in Coaldale, Schuylkill County. Officials said that Coaldale Borough of Police received a tip from a Good Samaritan regarding dogs at the property in poor health. After receiving that information, officials said a search warrant was received. During the execution of a search warrant, the PSPCA’s Officers found the dogs suffering from severe skin conditions, many with little or no hair on their bodies. Officials added that several dogs were suffering from open wounds, believed to be the result of sarcoptic mange. The owner surrendered all the animals over and they were brought to both the PSPCA's Philadelphia headquarters and Main Line Animal Rescue site to undergo examinations, officials said. The investigation into animal cruelty and neglect is ongoing, and charges are pending the conclusion of the full investigation, according to officials. \"The dogs, who should have had beautiful, fluffy white coats, were instead nearly hairless with crusted scabs and open wounds. Their condition is shocking,\" the Pennsylvania SPCA wrote in an Instagram post. \"The first thing that comes to mind when thinking of a Great Pyrenees is their beautiful, fluffy white coats,” CEO of the Pennsylvania SPCAJulie Klim said in a news release.“But the dogs rescued yesterday are a stark contrast; instead of white fur, there was red, itchy, rough, bloody skin. This didn’t happen overnight, and sadly these animals have been suffering for some time. We take solace in the fact that they are safe now, and beginning their journey to learning how pets are meant to be treated.” Anyone with information about this case or other cases involving animal cruelty is urged to call the Pennsylvania SPCA's cruelty hotline at (866) 601-SPCA.

Porice Diamond Mincy pleaded guilty to aggravated assault for shooting Cameron County District Attorney Paul J. Malizia in the leg at Malizia’s law office last June. The 32-year-old Brookville woman was sentenced to four to eight years in prison. Malizia was released from a hospital the day he was shot. Attorney General Michelle Henry, whose office prosecuted Mincy, called it a “brazen act of violence,\" and noted Malizia has remained in office since the attack. Henry's office said in a statement that Mincy showed up without an appointment at Malizia's office in rural Emporium, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) east of Erie, and made some sort of demands concerning a property transfer, a matter he handled as a private practice lawyer, not as district attorney. Mincy “became belligerent,” Henry's office said, and shot him in the leg before leaving in a vehicle. She was arrested shortly afterward. Her lawyer, Lonny Fish, said Monday that the other charges against her were dismissed. “She showed up in the office, she wasn’t happy with the answers that the secretary gave,” Fish said. “So she went and trashed one of the other offices, and then he approached her in the waiting room. And he hit her. To be honest, I think he was probably within his rights to do that — she was a trespasser.” Fish said Mincy did not have a license to carry a concealed weapon “so she was going to, most likely, be convicted of that, regardless.” He described Mincy as a mother of small children who had not been in trouble before. She had moved to the area from New York and was home schooling her kids. Malizia said in a phone interview Monday that after Mincy confronted his office worker and threw office material on the ground, she sucker punched him, breaking his nose. He said he took a swing at her but missed. Fish produced a cellphone video Mincy that recorded that he argued shows Malizia did actually punch Mincy. Malizia, currently 70 years old and in his fourth term in office, said he grabbed Mincy around the waist and tried to get her down some stairs and out of the office. “She stopped for a second and she turned her head and bit me on the thigh, on my left thigh,” he said. The bite did not tear through his jeans but was strong enough that it caused a wound. After that, she pulled a .25 caliber automatic handgun out of, he thinks, a fanny pack, and shot him in the other leg, Malizia said. The barrel was against his leg and the bullet passed through the outside of his leg, ricocheted off a wall and landed about 35 feet (11 meters) down a hallway. Malizia was treated at a hospital and released that night and did not miss any work as a result. Mincy was upset about which names had been put on a deed when ownership was transferred, Malizia said. “I wish her the best of luck,” Malizia said. “I mean that very sincerely.”","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/woman-guilty-shooting-rural-pa-prosecutor/3863692/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Another black bear sighting in Bucks County, the second one this month","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/GettyImages-1586150046.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=320%2C180","content":"Another black bear has been spotted roaming in a Bucks County town for the second time this month.

And now, health officials in both Philly and Montgomery County are telling residents to make sure they are vaccinated from the virus and, if not, officials are letting people know how to get the vaccine. According to the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, on Monday, they were reported one confirmed case of measles that may have been exposed to those in Philadelphia and in Meadowbrook, in Montgomery County. Officials said the exposures are believed to have happened throughout last week: “We believe there is no threat to the general public associated with this case of measles,” said Pennsylvania Department of Health Acting Secretary Dr. Debra Bogen, in a statement. “We encourage people who were possibly exposed to take action if they are not protected against measles. Many countries, including travel destinations, are experiencing measles outbreaks, so the potential for travel-related measles cases and subsequent outbreaks in the United States has increased. We strongly encourage parents to follow the CDC’s immunization schedule and get their children fully vaccinated as soon as they are able.” Officials note that measles is a highly contagious virus that can lead to serious complications. It spreads easily when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes, health officials said. About 90% of people who have close contact with an infected person will get measles if they are not immune, officials warned. \nAny residents who are not immune and may have been exposed, officials said that if you develop any symptoms through June 7, 2024 that appear like measles, contact your doctor immediately. The early symptoms of measles are fever, runny nose, cough, and puffy, red eyes, followed by rash, officials said. If you have been exposed to measles, you should also notify your local health department (Philadelphia: 215-685-6740, Montgomery County: 610.278.5117) or the state health department at 877-724-3258 for residents of other counties in Pennsylvania if you develop measles symptoms. For more information about measles, visit the CDC’s webpage on measles. Those in Montgomery County, who are uninsured or underinsured or have not previously received an MMR vaccine and fear they may have been exposed to an individual with a confirmed case of measles, can call the Montgomery County Office of Public Health Clinics in Norristown at 610.278.5145 or in Pottstown at 610.970.5040 to get an MMR vaccine at no cost regardless of their health insurance status.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/officials-alert-after-measles-exposures-philly-montco/3863986/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Testimony at Sen. Bob Menendez's bribery trial focuses on his wife's NJ house","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/GettyImages-2068288757-e1715526278995.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675","content":"A New Jersey businessman rescued the home of Sen. Bob Menendez's wife from foreclosure just as the Democrat allegedly helped him secure a lucrative business relationship with Egypt, a lawyer testifying at his bribery trial said Monday. Attorney John Moldovan told a Manhattan federal court jury that he was working for the businessman, Wael Hana, in July 2019 when he was asked to pay over $20,000 toward the Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, home’s mortgage. Moldovan said Hana provided the money that he delivered to a bank to negate the need for a mortgage foreclosure lawsuit. Menendez, 70, who has pleaded not guilty to multiple charges, moved into the home after the couple married a year later. Hana and Menendez's wife, Nadine, have pleaded not guilty in the case as well, although Nadine Menendez's trial has been postponed until July after she was diagnosed with breast cancer and surgery was required. In 2022, an FBI raid turned up 13 gold bars and over $480,000 in cash in the home, and a federal agent who led the raid testified extensively about it last week, saying tens of thousands of dollars were found stuffed in four jackets where the senator kept his coats. Other cash was found in bags and in a closet safe. Prosecutors say the gold bars, cash and a luxury car found in the couple's garage were bribery proceeds. Lawyers for Menendez have said that the gold bars belonged to his wife and that the senator hoarded cash at home as a reaction to trauma from his family losing everything, except cash, before they fled Cuba — and before he was born. Moldovan testified that Hana asked him to establish a legal record that the money to pay off outstanding debt on the mortgage was a loan rather than a gift. In all, Nadine Menendez owed nearly $271,000 on a $320,750 mortgage, Moldovan said. Prosecutors say the mortgage payment was made just as Hana was securing a monopoly with Egypt to ensure that any meat exported there from the U.S. was certified by Hana's company to prove it was processed in a manner that conformed with Islamic dietary requirements. Prosecutors say while he was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Menendez took favorable actions toward Egypt to aid Hana, who had been friends with Nadine Menendez for many years. He had to relinquish the position after his fall arrest. Among the charges lodged against the senator is that he was acting as a foreign agent of Egypt. The trial, which began last week, is supposed to last at least another month.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/politics/testimony-bob-menendez-bribery-trial-wife-house/3863676/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Bucks Co. woman charged with falsely accusing man of attempted rape, kidnapping","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Redners-Bucks-County-fake-kidnapping.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675","content":"A Bucks County woman is charged with falsely accusing a man of trying to rape and kidnap her outside of a grocery store in April. On Monday, May 20, 20-year-old Anjela Borisova Uromova of Bristol Township, Pennsylvania, was charged with false alarm to an agency of public safety, tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, false reports and unsworn falsification to authorities. Léelo en español aquí. Uromova initially accused a man -- who we are no longer naming due to the charges against him being dropped -- of attacking her outside of the Redner’s store on Lincoln Highway in Middletown Township, Pennsylvania, back on April 16. Uromova claimed the man grabbed her from behind after she parked her truck in the parking lot. She said she struggled to escape and that the man tried to pull down her pants, punched her in the face and attempted to move her to his vehicle. Uromova said she continued to scream and scared him off. The man was later arrested in Bristol Township and charged with attempted kidnapping, attempted rape and other offenses. He remained incarcerated for 31 days. During the investigation, Middletown Township Police collected and reviewed surveillance video from multiple retailers in the area where Uromova claimed the attack occurred. A detective with the Bucks County District Attorney’s Office also reviewed Uromova’s cellphone data. The investigation led to the discovery of multiple inconsistencies and contradictory information from Uromova, investigators said. On Friday, May 17, detectives spoke with Uromova about the inconsistencies. She then admitted to lying about the entire incident and police determined that an assault never occurred, investigators said. Uromova was arraigned on Monday and remanded to Bucks County Correctional Facility under $30,000 bail, 10 percent. The man, meanwhile, was freed from the Bucks County Correctional Facility on May 17 and all charges against him have been withdrawn. Information on Uromova's legal representation is currently unavailable online.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/bucks-co-woman-accused-of-falsely-accusing-man-of-attempted-rape-kidnapping/3863632/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"$5K offered for information leading to arrest of suspect in attack on off-duty Philly officer","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/image-7-4.png?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all","content":"The search continues for the fourth suspect in the attack on an off-duty officer in Philadelphia earlier this month. A $5,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest of 38-year-old Arthur Jones who faces charges of aggravated assault, robbery and firearm possession. Philadelphia Police and the U.S. Marshals Service Eastern Pennsylvania Violent Crime Fugitive Task Force are both searching for Jones, who is described as a man standing 5-foot-6 and weighing around 160 pounds with black hair, brown eyes and with a tattoo of dice on his left forearm. His last known address was on the 600 block of W. Harold Street. If you have any information on his whereabouts, please call the U.S. Marshals Philadelphia Tipline at 1-866-865-TIPS (8477) or Philadelphia Police. Investigators said Jones was one of multiple people involved in the attack and gun theft of an off-duty Philadelphia police officer earlier in May. Officer Eric Rodriguez was driving westbound along the 2100 block of Oxford Avenue on Sunday, May 12, around 7 a.m. when he became stuck in traffic behind another vehicle. After waiting through several red lights, Rodriguez, 42, honked his horn. A man, who police identified as 23-year-old Cian Dennis, also known as \"Duke,\" then approached Officer Rodriguez and punched him in the face while he sat in his car, investigators said. Rodriguez then got out of the vehicle and identified himself as a police officer. Dennis allegedly pulled out a gun and held it down to his side. Rodriguez and Dennis then struggled over the weapon, police said. At the same time, a man, later identified as 24-year-old Yusef Coleman, approached Rodriguez from behind and placed him in a headlock, investigators said. Coleman was also armed and Rodriguez began struggling with him over the gun, according to police. Rodriguez managed to push the gun away and the magazine fell out of it, investigators said. Rodriguez then fired the remaining round. No one was struck by the gunfire, police said. \"The firearm that he's struggling over, he has a hand on it. The offender has a hand on it. At some point he's able to get the magazine dislodged. It was an extended magazine,\" Philadelphia Police Deputy Commissioner Frank Vanore said. \"But the officer, due to his training, knows that there's another round in the chamber.\" Dennis then pointed his gun at Rodriguez and demanded he let go of the weapon, police said. At the same time, a nearby after-hours bar had just closed and a crowd of about a dozen people arrived at the scene, according to police. Investigators said Rodriguez was then beaten by multiple people and his personal weapon was stolen from his holster. A responding on-duty officer then arrived at the scene, causing the crowd to disperse. Coleman fled the scene in a black BMW, striking Rodriguez's leg, police said. Rodriguez was taken to the hospital and treated for a concussion, multiple injuries to his face and bruising, police said. Detectives looked at the officer’s body camera footage as well as surveillance video from the area. Investigators recognized Coleman and police responded to an area they say he normally frequented. Later that afternoon, Coleman as well as the black BMW were found on G and Hilton streets. Coleman was taken into custody. He is charged with criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault, assault of a law enforcement officer, robbery, theft by unlawful taking, weapon violations, and related offenses. Later that day, three women who investigators said were involved in the incident, arrived at 22nd District police headquarters and spoke with police. No charges have been filed against them though it’s unknown at this time if they will eventually face any charges. On Tuesday, May 14, at 8:35 p.m., Dennis surrendered to police. He's charged with criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault, robbery, theft by unlawful taking and other related offenses. A third suspect in the incident, 24-year-old Khamil Brown, was arrested on Wednesday, May 15, after police released surveillance photos of her. She is charged with criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault, robbery, theft by unlawful taking, violation of the uniform firearms act and other related offenses. Police also said they recovered Officer Rodriguez's stolen weapon. Officer Rodriguez is a nine-year veteran of the Philadelphia Police Department and is currently assigned to the 22nd District. After he fully recovers from his injuries, he'll be placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation from Internal Affairs. NBC10 reached out to Brown's attorney for comment. He said he could not provide a statement at this time. Online court documents don't list any legal representation for Dennis or a specific public defender for Coleman.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/5k-offered-for-information-leading-to-arrest-of-suspect-in-attack-on-off-duty-philly-officer/3863517/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Pro-Palestinian protesters at Drexel ignore call to disband, school to ‘return to normal operations'","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Little-Gaza-sign-Drexel-Palestine-protest.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675","content":"Pro-Palestinian protesters ignored a request by Drexel University's president to disband their encampment on Monday as arrests linked to campus demonstrations against the Israel-Hamas war surpassed the 3,000 mark nationwide. Drexel's campus was on lockdown, with classes being held virtually as police kept watch over the demonstration on the school's Korman Quad on Monday. Many Drexel employees were told to work from home. On Monday night the university released a statement from Drexel President John Fry that said in part, \"After conferring with Chief Singleton and his Drexel Public Safety team, I have determined that we have sufficient security in place to begin a phased return to normal operations. Tomorrow, labs, studio classes and simulation classes will return to being in-person, while lecture classes will remain virtual.\" At Drexel, which has about 22,000 students, Fry said protesters “have created a hostile, confrontational environment by subjecting passersby to antisemitic speech and by issuing several ‘demands’ that have unacceptably targeted individual members of our faculty and professional staff” as well as Jewish groups on campus. He previously threatened disciplinary action against Drexel students participating in the protest. Earlier, Fry said as many as 60 protesters were at the encampment: \"Now to the matter of the encampment itself,\" Fry wrote. \"Drexel University safeguards free speech and recognizes the right to peaceful protest, even when such protest features the expression of views that many members of our community might consider objectionable. At the same time, the University has the right both to impose restrictions on any demonstration that disrupts normal operations or creates a threatening, unsafe environment for other members of our community, and to take action against illegal trespassing. \"While reportedly peaceful and respectful of passersby for long stretches of time, this demonstration already has proved extensively disruptive to normal operations. It has forced the cancellation of numerous campus events and placed added strain on our Drexel Public Safety officers, who have been redeployed both to ensure the safety of protesters and passersby and to prevent unauthorized entry into our buildings and facilities. It also compelled us to move to remote learning and operations today.\" The Drexel protesters’ demands ranged from the university administration calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and divesting from companies that do business with Israel, to abolition of the Drexel police department and termination of the school’s chapter of Hillel, the Jewish campus organization, and another Jewish campus group, Chabad. The Drexel Palestine Coalition had no immediate response to Fry's ultimatum. The protest organizers said on Instagram in response to an earlier statement from Fry that “it is slander to accuse the encampment of ‘hateful’ or ‘intimidating’ actions when we have done neither.” The group accused Drexel and city police of harassment and intimidation. A pro-Palestinian group of faculty and staff also blasted Fry on Monday for shuttering campus facilities and said the encampment was “not disruptive to learning.” No arrests were reported. As the encampment reached night four students voiced their frustrations as events and activities continued to be cancelled. The women's lacrosse team said the demonstration is forcing them to miss the team's banquet. \"It’s super annoying. It’s just frustrating. It’s like we work all year for this and then something like this takes it away,\" Alex Wall, a Drexel student on the lacrosse team said. The university asked for a meeting with the Drexel Palestine Coalition, but the group refused and said no. When NBC10 asked demonstrators about this new development, they simply said no comment. \"We obviously pay to go here, and we can’t go to class. And school’s been online, and a lot of teachers canceled cause they’re frustrated, they can’t teach us in the proper way. We have graduation in 3 weeks,\" Wall said. Elsewhere, graduate students at the University of California, Santa Cruz, went on strike Monday as part of a rolling, systemwide protest over how administrators have responded to pro-Palestinian encampments, including arrests of protesters at the Los Angeles, San Diego and Irvine campuses. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, meanwhile, declined to charge four University of Pennsylvania protesters who were among 19 arrested Friday night, citing a lack of evidence submitted by campus police. Krasner’s office approved misdemeanor charges against three others. The remaining 12 arrested Friday night were given citations for failing to disperse. Penn's main commencement ceremony was held Monday under tightened security and a ban on flags and signs. There were no disruptions. But dozens of students walked out of Yale University’s commencement ceremony, some waving Palestinian flags. Yale said in a prepared statement that “a number of graduating students chose to peacefully walk out during the ceremony. University staff helped guide these individuals to an area outside the event space, and the ceremony continued as scheduled.” Wesleyan University in Connecticut said it had reached agreement with student protesters to review possible divestment, with meetings scheduled for later this month and in the fall. Wesleyan President Michael Roth announced the deal over the weekend and disclosed that 1.7% of Wesleyan’s endowment was invested in aerospace and defense businesses, but that none were directly involved in the manufacture of weapons. As part of the agreement, Wesleyan protesters cleared their encampment on Monday, according to a school spokesperson. The Associated Press has recorded at least 82 incidents since April 18 where arrests were made at campus protests across the U.S. At least 3,025 people have been arrested on the campuses of 61 colleges and universities. The figures are based on AP reporting and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies. The latest Israel-Hamas war began when Hamas and other militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking an additional 250 hostage. Palestinian militants still hold about 100 captives, while Israel’s military has killed more than 35,000 people in Gaza, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/politics/pro-palestinian-protesters-drexel-classes/3863202/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Family of teen executed in Pa. brings lawsuit nearly 100 years after his death","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Wrongfully-convicted-Pennsylvania-teen.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675","content":"The family of a teen who was executed by the state of Pennsylvania after being convicted of murder in 1931 has filed a lawsuit seeking damages nearly 100 years after his death. On Monday, attorneys for the family of Alexander McClay Williams, who was executed by the state when he was just 16, announced that they were bringing forward a lawsuit over Williams' execution after his conviction was vacated in 2022 and a new trial was ordered. However, Williams was not retried posthumously and, his record was expunged in 2017. Williams' relatives have long professed his innocence. In fact, in 2022, in dismissing charges against the teen, Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer argued that Williams should never have faced charges in the first place. “Sadly, we cannot undo the past. We cannot rewrite history to erase the egregious wrongs of our forebearers,” Stollsteimer said then. “However, when, as here, justice can be served by publicly acknowledging such a wrong, we must seize that opportunity.\" Now, citing Williams' wrongful conviction and death, his family has brought a lawsuit against the state and Delaware County. The suit seeks unspecified punitive damages. Williams, who was Black, was convicted after 34-year-old Vida Robare -- who was white and was a house matron at the Glen Mills School for Boys -- was found slain inside her cottage on the school grounds on October 3, 1930. Her body was discovered by her ex-husband Fred Robare, who was also an employee at the school. Williams was arrested and charged with stabbing Robare 47 times. However, there were no witnesses to the crime and Williams was never seen at the scene. Instead, prosecutors relied on confessions that were coerced out of the 16-year-old Williams. The lawsuit notes that, in working to convict Williams, prosecutors ignored other evidence -- including that Robare had filed for divorce from her husband, Fred, citing \"extreme cruelty\" as the reason. Her husband was the first to find her body on the day she was killed. Williams was executed June. 8, 1931. Attorneys for Williams' family said in a statement that, Sam Lemon, the great-grandson of Williams' criminal trial attorney -- William H. Ridley -- uncovered information showing that evidence against Williams was fabricated. In 2022, after hearing the new evidence presented, the Court of Common Pleas for Delaware County vacated the conviction and ordered a new trial. Then, Stollsteimer dismissed the case, the attorneys noted in a statement.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/family-youngest-person-executed-pa-brings-lawsuit/3863133/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Justin Timberlake bringing ‘SexyBack' to Philly with ‘Forget Tomorrow' concert","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/GettyImages-2153478765.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675","content":"Justin Timberlake is bringing \"SexyBack\" to Pennsylvania this fall during his 2024 \"The Forget Tomorrow World Tour.\" J.T. already \"Can't Stop the Feeling\" as he will be rolling into \"The Sweetest Place on Earth\" for an Independence Day concert at Hersheypark Stadium.

On Monday morning, Parker held a special meeting with members of the press in order to explain the need for workers to return to the office five days a week. \"In alignment with my administration's goals of creating a more visible and accessible government, I have notified all city workers that they will be transitioning to full-time in office work,\" she said. She said she's going to require all city employees to return full time to the office effective Monday, July 15, 2024. \"Employee presence at the workplace allows for more personal and productive interactions,\" Parker said. \"It facilitates communication. It promotes social connections as well as collaboration, innovation and inclusion. It also delivers on my promise of an accessible workforce that is best situated to serve the people of Philadelphia.\" Parker said this ruling \"establishes generally\" that all work will be done on-site and it will sunset the city's virtual work policy that was put in place in 2021. As the city works toward that July deadline, Parker said they are working with managers to prepare office space, equipment and other supports to prepare for employees to return. \"Our workforce is the only way that Philadelphia truly becomes what I promised to the people, that is the safest, cleanest, greenest big city in America, with access to economic opportunity for all,\" she said. According to the City of Philadelphia, the city employs at least 25,000 people. Parker said Monday that about 80% of this workforce have been working fully on-site since last year. Of the remaining 20%, Parker said, city employees worked between 31 to 75 hours per-pay-period on site. However, a reporter in the room on Monday pointed out that there were no leaders of the unions that represent city workers on hand for the morning announcement. \"I cannot affirm that any of the union presidents for the City of Philadelphia have embraced this,\" Parker admitted. Though, Parker said union leaders have been notified of the return to work demand. In a statement release following the mayor's announcement, David Wilson, president of AFSCME Local 2187, a union that supports municipal workers, said he was \"disheartened\" by the mayor's decision. \"We are disheartened to hear that the mayor decided to unilaterally implement returning my members to work 5 days a week on July 15. This to us, is a mandatory subject of bargaining to which the city clearly doesn’t,\" he said in a statement. \"Making such an impactful change in the middle of summer or in general, directly harms our members, their families and creates chaos. It has become clearer than ever that the mayor doesn’t not care for her city work force. Her actions speak louder than words.\" Earlier this year, Parker called senior city employees back to work. That started on March 4. This is a breaking news story.

The plan by the Peapack-Gladstone Borough Council would allow federal officials to euthanize the birds with carbon dioxide. The council made the decision after several failed attempts to take care of a geese population they claim is out of control. The method, which involves rounding up the birds during \"molting\" season, when they cannot fly, is approved by the federal government. \"The Borough Council appreciates those expressing their opinion regarding the infestation of the invasive species of geese that have inhabited Liberty Park. Indeed, the infestation has been a vexing issue for the Borough for some twenty years now. It is not a new issue,\" the council wrote in a statement regarding the geese. \"The Borough has tried every reasonable, humane effort to discourage these animals from occupying our Park. Some have worked temporarily, but none have provided a permanent solution.\" The council said that they opted to have the \"invasive\" birds removed by the USDA, a solution that gives them the best chance of controlling the infestation of geese. \"The US Fish and Wildlife Service has stated that a manageable population of Canadian Geese in New Jersey is 41,000; the current population of these birds in New Jersey is estimated to exceed 70,000,\" the council statement read. In addition to tearing up plantings, the council said that the birds are \"a threat to Park users, both human and animal,\" as they could spread disease and their behavior could put some people in harm's way. \"It is unfortunate that these birds have chosen the Park to make their home, however their presence is simply incompatible with safety and enjoyment by our residents,\" the council said. The gaggle of geese also impacts the water quality in the park's pond so much that the borough has had to treat the water to prevent large algae blooms. But there are still many in the town that oppose the drastic measure about to be taken. A change.com petition had already garnered more than 2,000 signatures ahead of the weekend.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/nj-peapack-gladstone-exterminating-canada-geese-at-park/3862672/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Elderly couple injured in Chester Co. house explosion","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Chester-house-explosion-5-19-24.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=0px%2C680px%2C1534px%2C864px&resize=1200%2C675","content":"Emergency crews responded to a report of a house explosion in Upper Oxford Township, in Chester County, on Sunday morning.

The group made their way over to Drexel around 7 p.m. Saturday where they set up tents on the Academic Quadrangle as police set up barricades to control the crowd. \"We wanna keep it peaceful at the same time. We don't want anyone to get hurt, just want people to be heard,\" Drexel University senior Kendell Lewis, of Bucks County, told NBC10. The rally has been peaceful so far with no physical violence, but the protesters have definitely been loud and passionate. Some have been calling officers names and calling for Palestinians to be free. A group by the name of Drexel Palestine Coalition released a statement on Saturday night that shed more light on the protesters setting up tents as well as what they are hoping to accomplish. A spokesperson with the group called the tent set up a \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment,\" and said that community members of the city of Philadelphia are part of the protest. Police in Philadelphia told NBC10 that not all of the protesters are Drexel students and some aren't even students at all. A Drexel University alumni was among the crowd and said, \"Open the books, let us see what it is, right, let us see where you're actually spending your money, and democratically we should be able to decide, as students who go to the area, who work for the schools, we should be the ones to decide where that money goes and what's done with it.” Law enforcement officials arrived to the campus dressed in riot gear just before 9 p.m. in response to the crowd. Some responding officers wore helmets and carried shields. Drexel University's President John Fry shared a statement on the encampment and protest Saturday. \"Drexel Police and Public Safety are closely monitoring this demonstration to ensure that it is peaceful and non-disruptive to normal operations, and that participants and passersby will behave respectfully toward one another. We will be prepared to respond quickly to any disruptive or threatening behavior by anyone against anyone,\" Fry said in the statement. \"We will not tolerate the destruction of property; the harassment or intimidation of our students, faculty or professional staff; or threatening behavior of any kind, including speech that is explicitly racist, antisemitic, or Islamophobic, that creates a hostile environment for members of our community based on race, color, national origin, religious affiliation, or shared ancestry. Nor will we allow anyone who is not a member of the Drexel community to trespass into our buildings and student residences. At the present time, our buildings are on lockdown and open only to those with clearance from Drexel’s Public Safety.\" The protest started around 4 p.m. outside of City Hall. Our cameras then captured hundreds of people who could be seen walking down JFK Boulevard in Center City in front of the Comcast Center just before 5:30 p.m. on Saturday. Some were holding signs while others were carrying Palestinian flags. Today's protest comes one day after 19 people were arrested, including six University of Pennsylvania students, on Friday night after attempting to occupy a building on the University of Pennsylvania campus, a university spokesperson said. Seven of the students arrested on Friday remained in custody Saturday awaiting felony charges, including one person who assaulted an officer, campus police said. A dozen were issued citations for failing to disperse and follow police commands. They have been released from custody. These protests this week come just one week after the University of Pennsylvania disbanded an encampment on its campus. Hours later that night, hundreds of people were walking through the streets of University City in Philadelphia carrying Palestinian flags. Now, protesters at Drexel University say that they would like to combine with the people who are part of the University of Pennsylvania protest in order to create a bigger footprint. Drexel protesters also want to encourage the university unions to go on strike in solidarity. \"Seeing it finally trickle down from our next-door neighbor to finally here, I hope it is more fruitful - and then more organizations around the area will also step up and also collab,\" Lewis said. Protesters at Drexel say that they plan to stay camped out for as long as possible. These protests now come at a tricky time as final exams begin in about one week for students at the university while many families are already in town for graduation at the University of Pennsylvania on Monday. Students and others have set up tent encampments on campuses around the country to protest the Israel-Hamas war, pressing colleges to cut financial ties with Israel. Tensions over the war have been high on campuses since the fall but the pro-Palestinian demonstrations spread quickly following an April 18 police crackdown on an encampment at Columbia University. The demonstrations reached all corners of the United States, becoming its largest campus protest movement in decades, and spread to other countries, including many in Europe. Nearly 3,000 people have been arrested on U.S. campuses over the past month. As summer break approaches, there have been fewer new arrests and campuses have been calmer. Still, colleges have been vigilant for disruptions to commencement ceremonies.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/drexel-pro-palestinian-protesters-philadelphia/3862362/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Alleged New Jersey arsonist arrested, charged for harassment and stalking","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2023/10/arson-suspect-3.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675","content":"Police in New Jersey have arrested a Haddon Township man in connection to arson in Haddonfield as well as a stalking-related vandalism that happened in Medford Township, according to officials from the Camden County Prosecutors Office.

Seven of the students arrested on Friday remained in custody Saturday awaiting felony charges, including one person who assaulted an officer, campus police said. A dozen were issued citations for failing to disperse and follow police commands. They have been released from custody. Around 9 p.m. pro-Palestinian protesters had hit the streets in University City once again. The activists had blocked the road near 34th and Walnut Streets, and that's when a group of them entered Fisher-Bennet Hall on Penn's campus. \"Twelve were issued citations for failure to disperse and failure to follow police commands and later released. Seven remain in custody awaiting felony charges, including one for assaulting a police officer. \" the spokesperson said in a statement. The spokesperson added that after the building was cleared, Penn Police recovered lock-picking tools and homemade metal shields fashioned from oil drums. The exit doors had been secured with zip-ties, barbed wire, and barricaded with metal chairs and desks, and the windows were covered over with newspaper and cardboard. Bike racks and metal chairs were also found blocking outside entrances.  SkyForce10 was over the scene of the protest, where police could be seen lined up next to the crowd on the sidewalk. Some officers were wearing helmets and carrying batons while some had ziptie handcuffs visible. Some of the protesters could be seen banging pots and pans while others used noisemakers in front of the police officers. Just before 10 p.m., the protesters appeared to rush into the street where the officers were standing. Our cameras caught the moments as the group was chanting, \"We hold power,\" while a woman shouted the chant into a megaphone. Some of the group made a long line from sidewalk to sidewalk with the rest of the protesters gathered behind them while they faced the police officers who were also standing in a line. One person could be seen on the shoulders of another protester while holding up a Palestinian flag. Then, around 10:30, the group of protesters moved to the intersection right outside of Franklin Field at the corner of 33rd and South streets. They gathered on one of the corners of the intersection before crossing to the other side of the street. Meanwhile, an officer stood in the middle of the intersection and directed car traffic to avoid the area of the campus. This protest comes one week after the University of Pennsylvania disbanded an encampment on its campus. Hours later that night, hundreds of people were walking through the streets of University City in Philadelphia carrying Palestinian flags. Students and others have set up tent encampments on campuses around the country to protest the Israel-Hamas war, pressing colleges to cut financial ties with Israel. Tensions over the war have been high on campuses since the fall but the pro-Palestinian demonstrations spread quickly following an April 18 police crackdown on an encampment at Columbia University. The demonstrations reached all corners of the United States, becoming its largest campus protest movement in decades, and spread to other countries, including many in Europe. Nearly 3,000 people have been arrested on U.S. campuses over the past month. As summer break approaches, there have been fewer new arrests and campuses have been calmer. Still, colleges have been vigilant for disruptions to commencement ceremonies.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/protesters-arrested-following-attempt-to-occupy-university-of-pennsylvania-building/3862280/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Black Horse Pike crash kills bicyclist in Hamilton Township, police say","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Black-Horse-Pike-crash-2.png?resize=320%2C180&quality=85&strip=all","content":"Police in New Jersey are investigating after a man was killed Friday night while riding a bicycle along Black Horse Pike in Hamilton Township.

They say the place is more than just a fitness center, it's a home away from home and their connection to so many friends. One man, Leon Williams, suffered two bouts of throat cancer that took a lot away from him, and now he is losing his fitness center in Vineland, NJ. \"It was something normal for him. He was around people. The instructors are great. Everybody treats him like anyone else,\" his wife Debbie said. The Inspira Health System in Cumberland County owns the fitness center and they recently sent members a letter saying that this location and their smaller Bridgeton and Elmer locations will be closing at the end of June. \"We are emotional about it because we have developed relationships,\" gym member Kathy Trovarelli told NBC10. Judith Augustus has been a member for 13 years. She told NBC10, \"The camaraderie is missing. People come here it's not just about staying physically fit but the emotional part is needed, the connection. Some people have nothing else and no one else.\" In a statement, Inspira says they understand why their members are upset and they say they will be bringing in other local fitness centers to offer services to the soon-to-be displaced members. Some of those members held a rally on Friday, but they say some people were likely scared away by a pretty sizeable showing of Inspira security employees and the fact that the gym was closed today because of the rally. The members are sad but fired up. \"it is disgraceful and it's disgusting,\" Trovarelli said. The group is hoping that Inspira will have a change of heart, or at least rethink their business plan, and keep this gym open. \"When these organizations look at numbers they don't comprehend or want to comprehend the stories behind those numbers,\" yoga teacher Ahmad Graves-El said.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/vineland-new-jersey-inspira-gym-closing-june/3861929/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker signs executive action announcing plan to clean the city","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/signing-clean-and-green.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=320%2C180","content":"The entire city of Philadelphia is supposed to be cleaned up this summer.

It's going to be a busy summer for the city with plans over a 13-week span. Residents who spoke with NBC10 on Friday are hoping it actually gets done. \"All Philadelphians want a cleaner, safer, greener Philly. This is what I mean when I say, 'One Philly,'\" Parker said. It's an ambitious plan with a team of 38 people tasked with finding ways to make Philly cleaner and greener as efforts are expected to ramp up in the next few weeks. “Cleaning every neighborhood, every block at a time by fixing potholes, fixing abandoned property, vacant cars, abandoned autos. We got the people here to do it we’re excited,\" Director of Clean and Green Initiatives Carlton Williams said. For South Philadelphia resident Duncan Lloyd, the effort could be a way for the city to make a good first impression on visitors. \"Obviously summer is a big tourist time for folks to come in to Philadelphia and, like, first impressions go a long way,\" Lloyd said. \"So, if you're not from the city and see a cleaner, more kept up Philadelphia, I think you'll want to come back.\" We're told that city workers will collect trash, sweep streets, fill potholes, fix abandoned properties and deal with illegal dumping.

The Altoona Mirror reported that district officials cut the song the day before the concert, saying students had voiced concerns about the song and the “divisiveness and controversy in the nation.” The district also received several calls from people regarding the song and its inclusion in the concert, officials said. This raised concerns about potential disruptions at the show. School Board President Troy Wright called the decision a “lose-lose situation” and said parents were threatening to pull their children from the concert over the song. “We can’t make everyone happy,” Wright told the newspaper. “We have to do the balancing act between who supports it and who doesn’t support it, and our job is trying to find the balance between it.” The decision to cut the song was made by District Superintendent Betsy Baker and Middle School Principal Amy Miller. Baker said “Lift Every Voice and Sing” was one of many songs selected for the chorus by the music teachers who “picked songs that they felt were appropriate.” Because the chorus practiced other songs, one of those was picked to fill the slot. “We wanted everyone to feel comfortable,” Baker told the newspaper, saying the decision to cut the song was “clearly a divisive issue here\" and stressing that race had nothing to do with the decision. \"There was no right decision, but we focused on letting all of the kids participate in the concert,\" Baker said. Stephen Hershberger, whose son was among the students performing in the chorus concert, was among residents who criticized the decision. “Cutting the song just sends the message that a few individuals’ discomfort outweighs the perspective and care and concern of minority students and others who don’t have the same beliefs as them,” Hershberger told the newspaper. The Blair County NAACP has said it executive board will proceed with a formal investigation into the district's decision, the newspaper reported.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/pennsylvania-school-district-removes-song-student-choral-concert/3861649/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"American Airlines adds new flights to tropical destinations from PHL for winter season","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/GettyImages-2031347923.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=320%2C180","content":"Are you dreading the return of winter?

Nearly two-thirds of students in the Hazleton Area School District are Hispanic, but no Hispanic person has ever been elected to its school board, prompting the court challenge claiming non-Hispanic white voters have employed the district's “at-large” election system to keep things that way. Two mothers of children enrolled in the anthracite coal region district sued in February, asking for changes to a system they argue dilutes their voting strength and violates the federal Voting Rights Act and the constitutional right to equal protection of the law. The district's 78,000 residents are about 55% white, 40% Hispanic and 5% Black, Asian or multi-racial, according to the lawsuit, with Hispanics concentrated around Hazleton. Hazleton is among several smaller cities in eastern Pennsylvania where Latino populations have grown large enough to have significant impacts on elections, including this year's hotly contested races for president and U.S. Senate. The Hazleton board has shown “a significant lack of responsiveness” to the needs of the district’s Hispanic residents, the plaintiffs argued in the lawsuit. “This includes, but is not limited to, disregard for serious concerns relating to disparate student discipline, student registration procedures founded on unfair stereotypes, inadequate school staffing, lack of qualified translators and lack of effective communication with parents,” according to the lawsuit. The district requires three separate proofs of address to establish residency from those seeking to be registered for school. A bilingual sign to that effect is posted at the entrance to the administration building, with “must have three” underlined and “no exceptions!” added in handwriting. Latino leaders say such proofs can be a challenge to produce for those who are new to the country and may lack stable living arrangements. Some say school translators are overworked and understaffed. And there is a feeling that students without strong English skills can be subject to harsher disciplinary treatment. “We are in an area that is very conservative,” said Vianney Castro, a native of the Dominican Republic and a Democrat who lost November's mayoral election in Hazleton by about 25 percentage points. “They have refused to change. And everything that is happening around us is change.” Tony Bonomo, president of the Hazleton Area School Board, said electing voters by region may be more fair, but he and the other incumbent board members are not likely to initiate such a change. “I do think we’re probably close to having that happen,” said Bonomo, a seven-term Democrat. “You almost have to. When you you have a district that is 60% Latino or whatever, something has to happen.” In seeking dismissal of the case last month, the school district's lawyer argued the two plaintiffs are not entitled to sue under the Voting Rights Act and that voters are divided more by partisan political affiliation than by race and ethnicity. “Plaintiffs fail to allege with any credible specificity that the claimed Hispanic group of voters is politically cohesive or that the White majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually to defeat the minority’s preferred candidate — both assumptions flatly refuted by the reality of the partisan demographics of Hazleton,” the board’s lawyer wrote. The nine members of the all-white school board are elected in the district as a whole, an at-large election system the board adopted in 1989 amid policy disputes over spending. Previously, board members were elected from smaller regions within the district. The Pennsylvania State Education Association says 310 of the state’s 500 school boards, like Hazleton Area, have boards elected entirely at-large, 175 elected from regions within the overall district and 15 using a hybrid system. The Hazleton Area School Board filled vacancies with non-Hispanics twice in recent years, the Hazleton Standard-Speaker reported in February. The Bethlehem Area School District settled a similar federal lawsuit in 2008 prompted by a decision to sidestep two Hispanic candidates and appoint a white man to fill a vacancy. Under that settlement, Bethlehem, about 50 miles from Hazleton, created three geographic seats but continues to elect the other six members at-large. The influx of new residents has long been a topic of conflict in Hazleton. The City Council approved the Illegal Immigration Relief Act in July 2006, seeking to deny business permits to companies that employ people who are living in the country illegally, fine landlords who rent to them and require tenants to register and pay for a rental permit. A federal judge struck down the ordinance. The state's booming Latino population is experiencing growing pains as it works to translate raw numbers in political power, said state Rep. Manny Guzman, a Democrat from Reading and vice chair of the Pennsylvania Legislative Latino Caucus. “We need to do a better job of turning out our voters and building a bench within these respective areas,” Guzman said. The U.S. Justice Department earlier this month filed a document supporting the ability of private plaintiffs, such as the two women who are suing the Hazleton district, to bring such challenges under the 1965 Voting Rights Act.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/politics/latinos-hazleton-pennsylvania-school-board/3861261/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"‘FCANCER' plate leads to judge ruling Delaware vanity plate rules allow viewpoint discrimination","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2022/08/FCANCER-license-plate-Delaware.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675","content":"Delaware’s vanity license plate program is unconstitutional because it allows officials to discriminate against certain viewpoints when deciding whether to approve applications, a federal judge has ruled. Tuesday’s ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Kari Lynn Overington, 43, of Milton, a breast cancer survivor whose “FCANCER” license plate was recalled in 2021 because it contained a “perceived profanity.” Overington filed a lawsuit that year challenging the decision, and the American Civil Liberties Union later took up her case. “I’m very grateful that I was able to have my voice heard. What they were doing was wrong,” Overington told The Associated Press on Wednesday. In a deposition last year, Overington testified that when she applied for the vanity plate, she explained that it meant “fight cancer.” DMV officials asked her about Facebook posts showing her wearing a T-shirt reading “f—- cancer\" and celebrating her “f—- cancer” anniversaries, using an expletive and not the word “fight.” A spokesman for the Delaware Department of Transportation said the agency will review the decision before commenting on it and the future of the vanity plate program. A DOT attorney said at a March court hearing that Transportation Secretary Nicole Majeski had talked about getting rid of all vanity plates. Although the lawsuit stemmed from Overington’s feelings about cancer, it exposed how the Division of Motor Vehicles has handled attempts by drivers to express themselves, including those taking aim at President Joe Biden with “Let’s Go Brandon” criticisms. In ruling for Overington, Judge Gregory Williams rejected the DMV's arguments that the alphanumeric combination of letters and numbers on vanity plates constitutes “government speech” and can be regulated as officials see fit. The DMV based its argument on a 2015 Supreme Court ruling allowing Texas to prohibit the Sons of Confederate Veterans from creating a specialty license plate design featuring a Confederate battle flag. Williams noted that the Texas case involved the background art and designs on specialty plates, not the alphanumeric text. Since then, courts in California, Maryland, Rhode Island and Tennessee have ruled that alphanumeric text on vanity plates is private speech, while Hawaii and Indiana courts have said it is government speech. “This court agrees with the majority of courts on this issue,” wrote Williams, declaring that Delaware’s regulations permit viewpoint discrimination and are unconstitutionally overbroad and arbitrarily enforced. Unlike in Delaware, Hawaii’s rules are more defined and objective, simply banning “vulgar” words while including details about which dictionary should be consulted, the judge noted. In Delaware, no vanity plate can be issued if it is “considered to be obscene” by DMV officials. The regulations also state that plates that make “unflattering statements about any particular group or raise politically sensitive issues” should be referred to top administrators for review. DMV records disclosed in the lawsuit illustrate the arbitrary approach officials have taken in denying vanity plates, using terms such as “negative,” “questionable,” “mean,” “evil,” “inappropriate,” “disgusting” and “could be offensive.” In making their decisions, officials frequently relied on the “Urban Dictionary,” a crowd-sourced website that invites people to submit and define slang words and phrases. In one case, officials combined two acronyms found on the site to conclude that “SNDNSNW” did not really mean “sand and snow.” “A lot of them, you really got to scratch your head,” ACLU attorney Dwayne Bensing said Wednesday. “You kind of saw a race to the bottom … as to who could have the most dirty-minded interpretation.” DMV officials have been particularly sensitive about vanity plates with possible sexual innuendo and those aimed at Biden. “Let’s Go Brandon,” and any of its permutations, for example, are off limits. The phrase dates to a crowd chant after a NASCAR race in Alabama in 2021. The crowd chanted “F--- Joe Biden” during a televised interview with race winner Brandon Brown, but an NBC reporter incorrectly said fans were shouting “Let’s go, Brandon.” Although Delaware DMV official Charles Gourley declared “FJOEB” to be “defamation to our current sitting president,” even the name “Brandon” is problematic. A driver wanting “FJBLGB6,” explained that it referred to “kids names,” but DMV official Robyn Bose instead described it as “hate speech and fighting words and vulgar.” Delaware is not the only state where officials are sensitive to vanity plates critical of the president. An Ohio man filed a federal lawsuit earlier this month after his application for a vanity plate reading “F46 LGB” was rejected in 2022. That same year, Alabama officials reversed course and allowed a gun store owner to keep a vanity plate reading “LGBF JB” after initially telling him it would not be renewed.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/fcancer-license-plate-delaware/3861351/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"NJ overall gambling revenue up 10.4% in April, but in-person casino winnings down","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2023/09/AP23258674430177.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=320%2C180","content":"New Jersey's casinos, horse tracks that accept sports bets and their online partners won more than half a billion dollars from gamblers in April, an increase of 10.4% from a year earlier, state gambling regulators said Thursday. But that was due in large part to the state's second-best month ever for internet gambling. The industry's key business — money won from in-person gamblers — continued to sag, down 6.3% from a year ago. Figures released by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement show the casinos, tracks and their partners won nearly $511 million in April from in-person gambling, internet betting and sports bets. But money from internet and sports bets must be shared with casino partners such as sports books and tech platforms and is not solely for the casinos to keep. For that reason, casinos consider in-person winnings to be their core business. And it's one that continues to struggle. Six of the nine casinos won less from in-person gamblers in April than they did a year earlier. And six of nine casinos also won less in-person money this April than they did in April 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Jane Bokunewicz, director of the Lloyd Levenson Institute at Stockton University, which studies the Atlantic City gambling market, said that while in-person casino winnings are likely to improve in the coming summer months as visitation spikes, Atlantic City may see more of its revenue growth come from non-gambling areas such as food and beverage sales. “It will be many months before a clear picture of this trend is available, but operators’ recent investments in improving resort offerings suggest that a significant shift in the market’s overall revenue mix could be coming,” she said. “A focus beyond gaming, to the elements that make Atlantic City unique and a stronger competitor against the threat of New York City casinos, is simply good business.” In terms of in-person revenue, the Borgata won $58.3 million, up half a percent from a year earlier; Hard Rock won $41.1 million, up 6%; Ocean won $28.8 million, down 15.6% in a month during which part or all of its casino floor was shut down for four days while switching from one computer system to another; Tropicana won $17.7 million, down 9.2%; Harrah's won $16.4 million, down nearly 25%; Caesars won $16 million, down 18.4%; Bally's won $13.1 million, down 4.9%; Golden Nugget won $12.7 million, down 3.1% and Resorts won $12.4 million, virtually flat from a year ago. Including internet and sports betting revenue, Borgata won $107.7 million, down 0.2%; Golden Nugget won nearly $66 million, up 20.4%; Hard Rock won $55.2 million, up 18.6%; Ocean won $35.7 million, down 8.6%; Tropicana won $34.8 million, up nearly 28%; Bally's won $21.5 million, up 5%; Harrah's won $18.3 million, down 16%; Caesars won $16.1 million, down 19.3%; and Resorts won $12.1 million, down nearly 2%. Among internet-only entities, Resorts Digital won $66.4 million, up 7.2%, and Caesars Interactive NJ won $612,910 in a month in which three internet gambling sites switched from the interactive company to Tropicana. Internet gambling had its second-best month in April with nearly $188 million won online, an increase of 18.2% from a year ago. Sports betting brought in over $1 billion in April, with $106 million of that total kept as revenue after paying off winning bets and other expenses. The Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, near New York City, won the lion's share of that at $73.1 million. Resorts Digital won nearly $19 million; Freehold Raceway won $2.2 million, and Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport won $953,798.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/business/new-jersey-gambling-revenue/3860817/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Philadelphia could lose its spot as the 6th-biggest U.S. city, census data shows","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/GettyImages-582482657.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=320%2C180","content":"New federal estimates show Philadelphia remains the nation's sixth-most-populous city, despite a decline in population throughout the pandemic. But the U.S. Census Bureau data out this week also shows San Antonio, Texas, could surpass Philadelphia in the coming years if trends continue. The data shows that Philadelphia lost 3.3% of its population — roughly 53,000 residents — between April 2020 and July 2023, dropping the city’s overall population to about 1,550,542. San Antonio, meanwhile, saw the largest numerical increase in its population of any city in the country in 2023, adding about 22,000 residents last year. Its population now stands at 1,495,295, according to census estimates, or about 55,000 people behind Philadelphia. The data also shows Philadelphia is not the only major city to see its population shrink. Nearly all its peer cities in the Northeast and Midwest saw losses, too — some coming at much greater rates. New York City saw a 6.2% decrease in population during the peak pandemic years, while population drops in Boston and Baltimore also outpaced Philly’s decline from 2020 to 2023. Some West Coast cities also shrank more than Philly, including San Francisco, which lost 7.4% of its population, and San Jose, California. On the opposite end, five of the nation's 10 largest cities added population, mostly in the South and Southwest.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/philadelphia-could-lose-its-spot-as-the-6th-biggest-u-s-city-census-data-shows/3860931/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"‘Hi my name is Jack': Montco school celebrates student with congenital disorders of glycosylation ","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/image-41-2.png?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all","content":"Bridle Path Elementary school students and teachers geared up in green for a celebration of one special kid.  On Thursday the Montgomery County elementary school took the time to teach students about Jack’s genetic disorder, called congenital disorders of glycosylation.  While teaching students about the disorder, teachers made sure to celebrate Jack by wearing green and eating green snacks with the kids. “He’s amazing. He is an actual joy,” Jack’s teacher, Laura Grabon, said. According to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), “Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a large group of rare genetic disorders that affect the addition of sugar building blocks, called glycans, to proteins in cells throughout the body.”  When a person has CDG, problems occur in how the sugar building blocks are attached to proteins. This affects how cells in every part of the body function which can lead to a wide range of health problems, according to CHOP. How does a child get CDG? According to CHOP it's genetic, so in most cases, it is inherited from parents. If only one copy of a gene’s pair has the mutation the person would not have CDG, the disorder only typically occurs when both parents have the genetic mutation.  Chop says that when a person has CDG there can be many different signs and symptoms including:  Then, as children enter adolescence and grow to adulthood, additional symptoms may include: Despite the difficulties Jack might go through with CDG, his symptoms do not stop him from spending time with friends and learning at school.  He was pretty shy at first, but on this CDG day he had no problem showing off his writing or leading his classmates through a lesson. His classmates are not shy to talk about Jack. \"He's fun and kind,\" one classmate said Another student said, \"he's nice and plays with me.\" Grabon said, “He’s reading on grade level, he's writing his letters and words and he’s beyond proud.” Teaching about differences at this young age benefits everyone, not just for now but in the future too.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/congenital-disorders-of-glycosylation-cdg-wear-green-pennsylvania/3861127/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Philadelphia Renaissance Faire returns with twice as many vendors and high-flying talent","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Philly-Ren-Faire-2023-232_Rylan-Lott.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=320%2C180","content":"Hear ye!

Bob Menendez reveals his wife has breast cancer as his trial focuses on FBI raid of his home","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/GettyImages-2075815597.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675","content":"Sen. Bob Menendez said Thursday that his wife will undergo a mastectomy after she was diagnosed with breast cancer, a revelation made just as the first evidence — pictures of 13 gold bars and over $480,000 in cash seized from the couple's home — was shown to jurors at his New York bribery trial. The New Jersey Democrat said he was revealing his wife's health crisis at her request after repeated inquiries from the media. “We are, of course, concerned about the seriousness and advanced stage of the disease,” the senator said in a statement. He added: “She will require follow up surgery and possibly radiation treatment. We hope and pray for the best results.” Previously, lawyers for Nadine Menendez had requested her trial on charges in the case be delayed after she was diagnosed with what was only previously described publicly as a serious health issue. Judge Sidney H. Stein had postponed her trial until at least July. Nadine Menendez, who married the senator two years after she began dating him in 2018, has pleaded not guilty. One of her lawyers declined comment in response to Bob Menendez's disclosure Thursday. The senator, on trial with two of three businessmen who allegedly paid him bribes, has pleaded not guilty to charges of bribery, fraud, extortion, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent of Egypt. A third businessman has pleaded guilty in the case and will testify against the others. Menendez's statement about his wife was released just after opening statements were completed and the presentation of evidence began at his trial in Manhattan federal court. The trial's first witness was an FBI agent, Aristotelis Kougemitros, who described leading a June 2022 raid on the couple's Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, home. He testified that two 1-kilogram (2.2-pound) gold bars, 11 1-ounce gold bars and $486,461 in cash were among valuables found in the home, along with cellphones and jewelry. In all, 52 items were seized. At first, Kougemitros said, the FBI had directed agents to photograph any cash that was found, but not necessarily to seize it. But he said that based on his experience and training, along with the “totality of the circumstances,” that he decided the amount of cash was so voluminous that it would be seized. “I believed there was evidence potentially of a crime,” he said, drawing an objection from Menendez's lawyer that was sustained by the judge. Through dozens of photographs and the agent's testimony, jurors were taken on a tour of the home as Kougemitros described where cash and the gold bars were discovered by a team of eight agents that was later supplemented by two Manhattan agents who brought cash-counting machines. The gold bars were found in a safe and on the floor nearby inside locked closets in a bedroom, he said. Much of the cash was found stuffed in jacket pockets, in two pairs of boots and on a shelf in the home's basement, he said. One pair of Timberland boots contained $14,500 in cash nearly evenly divided while another set of boots also had cash stuffed in each boot, he said. A black jacket, which was among four jackets found to contain cash, had $21,000 in envelopes in its pockets, Kougemitros said. The other jackets, he added, had $4,300, $6,000 and $8,000. On a shelf nearby, he said, a plastic bag contained $100,000, while another bag held $95,000. Earlier in the day, lawyers for New Jersey real estate developer Fred Daibes and businessman Wael Hana delivered their opening remarks to jurors a day after a prosecutor and Menendez’s lawyer gave opening statements. Attorney Lawrence Lustberg, representing Hana, said prosecutors had built their case against his client on “innocent acts.” He said Hana was longtime friends since 2009 with Nadine Menendez and that Hana and Nadine Menendez had exchanged expensive gifts over the years. He said there was never a time when Hana either directly to Bob Menendez or indirectly through Nadine Menendez gave a bribe in exchange for official acts by the senator. Attorney Cesar De Castro, representing Daibes, told jurors the case was about relationships and prosecutors were trying to exploit facts about a three-decade friendship between the senator and Daibes to claim crimes occurred. He said they will conclude his client was not guilty. On Wednesday, attorney Avi Weitzman, representing Bob Menendez, told jurors his client was unaware that his spouse had accepted gifts from the three businessmen and did not know about cash and gold bars hidden in a closet at their home. The statement came after an opening statement by Assistant U.S. Attorney Lara Pomerantz in which the prosecutor repeatedly highlighted the gold bars and cash found in the home. Menendez has held public office continuously since 1986, serving as a state legislator before 14 years as a U.S. congressman. In 2006, then-Gov. Jon Corzine appointed Menendez to the Senate seat he vacated when he became governor. The trial, which began Monday, is projected to last up to two months. ___ Catalini reported from Trenton, New Jersey.","href":"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/politics/sen-bob-menendez-wife-breast-cancer-trial/3860581/","nationalNews":false},{"title":"Raccoon invades field and dodges trash can-wielding officials at soccer game","image":"https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/240516-racoon-soccer-getty.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675","content":"American sports may have seen its most epic battle of the year: a single raccoon vs. a team of men trying to capture it with trash cans. The stripy tailed interloper stopped play for almost two minutes in the Major League Soccer game between Philadelphia Union and New York City on Wednesday night, prompting a battle of wit and skill with staff on the field of Subaru Park in Chester, PA.   “We need to find him a ball because he’s moving very well in the center of midfield,” said Callum Williams, the commentator on Apple TV. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything quite as bizarre as this, particularly given the amount of time he’s remained on the field” he added. A stadium official approached the urban scavenger with the most appropriate of impromptu capture devices — a trash can — but the creature was too quick and got got away. Having run the almost the full length of the field in its bid for freedom, a second member of staff then attempted to stop the furry fugitive, before a third man armed with yet another trash can finally managed to capture it. By this point the match commentators were rooting for the raccoon. “This is marvelous entertainment. Go on, raccoon! You can get away,” Williams said, before adding “Don’t hurt him!” as the plastic prison was at last put into place. Dubbed “Raquinho” by some, it now holds the not particularly well-contested record of spending the most amount of minutes of any raccoon on the field in MLS history, the league said. Fans speculated which team would be first to sign the raccoon, given its impressive footwork and acceleration. One YouTube commentator argued that it had already shown more promise than any Manchester United attacker this season. The raccoon was picked up by a local pest control company and released back into the wild, Philadelphia Union said in a statement on X. Fans speculated which team would be first to sign the raccoon, given its impressive footwork and acceleration, with one YouTube commentator arguing that it had already shown more promise than any Manchester United attacker this season. The raccoon's appearance was not a good omen for the home team: Philadelphia lost the game 2-1, leaving the team in ninth place in the MLS table after 12 games.

Cragin Dam area in the Coconino National Forest.\n\n“We really wanted to tackle the bigger crisis that we were facing here which is the increased risk of wildfire,” said Elvy Barton, SRP water and forest sustainability senior manager.\n\nPayson and nearby communities are within one of the top fire sheds in the country.\n\nThe area is home to lots of small trees and brush, which can be fuel for fires.\n\n“Then it just gets into the top of the trees and that’s called a crown fire and once you get into a crown fire it creates a lot of devastating impacts and it’s really hard to put those fires out,” Barton said.\n\nShe says wildfires devastate the ecosystem, landscape or people living in the area, but they also impact those in the Phoenix metro.\n\nThe water supply SRP manages comes from 8.3 million acres of land in northern Arizona.\n\nSnowfall and rain provide water that travels through the watershed into SRP reservoirs. The water is then delivered via canals to 2.5 million homes and businesses in the Phoenix area.\n\n“Post wildfire flooding sends big slugs of debris, ash and sediment into our streams, our lakes and to the reservoirs SRP operates and maintains. Those reservoirs act as long time water storage supplies for the Valley,” said Barton.\n\nThe project focuses on treating overgrowth in a process known as forest thinning, or removing trees.\n\n“Specifically to the Ponderosa Pine forest, you’re supposed to be able to see through the forest,” she said. “You’re supposed to be able to walk between the trees and have spaces and different levels of vegetation.”\n\nA lot of work goes into choosing which trees are removed or stay.\n\n“We leave larger, older trees behind to thrive and we also create the opportunity for grasses, forbs, and bushes to grow, which create a wonderful food source for wildlife out here,” Barton said.\n\nRemoving trees may sound counterintuitive to keeping our forest healthy, but SRP has data to prove otherwise.\n\n“What we can demonstrate is that these thinning projects allow for more water to soak into the soils which creates a healthier watershed and ecosystem, but it also creates additional water that will make it to streams, rivers and reservoirs,” Barton said.\n\nSRP has previously worked with other big companies on sustainability projects, including Meta and Google.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

City workers pick up old furniture, household fixtures, and all kinds of bulky trash placed on the curb by homeowners to be removed.\n\nFor years, Phoenix crews have made quarterly trips to every Phoenix neighborhood as part of its bulk trash collection program. But now, the city is making some changes.\n\nThe City of Phoenix Public Works Department says residents can schedule their own bulk trash pickup beginning this fall.\n\n(FILE - 2022) Some Phoenicians have been waiting for weeks for their trash to get picked up.(Arizona's Family)\n\n“With our new program, we’re hoping that it’ll be a lot more convenient for customers,” said Gisella Gonzalez, a Public Works Supervisor with the City of Phoenix.\n\nThe change will allow homeowners more flexibility, rather than waiting for the quarterly pickup during scheduled dates based on the citywide calendar. Beginning Sept. 30, bulk trash will be collected by appointment only. All bulk trash collection on or after Sept. 30 must be scheduled online.\n\nResidents will schedule a pickup through an online portal, which will offer available collection dates based on their address. After selecting a date, homeowners will receive an email confirmation. They can place their bulk items at the edge of their property or curbside no more than seven days before their pickup appointment. Customers will be allowed up to 10 cubic yards of trash per collection.\n\n“Whenever there’s any ongoing projects that they have, like they’re able to call in and get those items picked up rather than having to wait for their quarterly collection or having to go to the transfer station and drop it off,” she said.\n\nRight now, homeowners can place bulk trash on the curb up to 16 days before pickup. Under the new program, you’ll know exactly which day the pickup will happen, and you can put it outside up to a week in advance.\n\nThat means the city can schedule the pickups more efficiently while minimizing the time the trash sits on the curb.\n\n“With our new program, we’ll know specifically where the piles are located and how many scheduled appointments we have for the day,” Gonzalez said. “So it’ll just make it easier overall to make sure that we’re getting to those piles by the end of the day.”\n\nLike the old program, bulk trash can still be picked up four times a year. The department says the new model will keep bulk trash off the streets around the holiday season, including Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s.\n\nThe quarterly pickup schedule remains in effect until the start date. For more information on the program, visit phoenix.gov/publicworks/garbage/bulktrash.\n\nImportant Dates to Remember\n\nLate August 2024 – Residents can begin scheduling bulk trash appointments online.\n\nMonday, September 30, 2024 – First day of Appointment-Based Bulk Trash. All bulk trash collections on or after this date must be scheduled online.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

Before that, the alternative was open heart surgery.\n\n“We had many patients that we could not do anything about. Surgery was too high of a risk for them. The only option they had was to just try some medication and let life take its own course. Now you can get this procedure without having to open our chest,” said Feseha.\n\nFeseha said anyone with narrowed heart valves has a significantly lower life expectancy.\n\n“In about five years, only about 20% of them are alive,” he said.\n\nIt’s been a life-changing procedure for people like Williams, who could barely walk prior to his TAVR procedure.\n\n“It got worse as time went on,” said Darrell.\n\nYRMC performed their first TAVR procedure 10 years ago, and they’ve done nearly 700 procedures since.\n\nThis week, they’re celebrating a decade of this procedure that has revolutionized cardiac care.\n\nAbby Cockburn works with TAVR patients at YRMC. Cockburn, along with a team of specialists, screen potential TAVR patients and determine if they’re a good candidate for the procedure.\n\nShe said they perform about three TAVR procedures weekly.\n\n“It’s life-changing. You can have a patient that couldn’t do the simplest thing for themselves,” said Cockburn.\n\nWilliam is taking it one step at a time, one day at a time. He said he’s been keeping up with his rehab workouts with an overwhelming sense of appreciation.\n\n“Oh I’m grateful, grateful,” said Williams.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

We want their families to be healthy and live longer. The schools represent an important interface between our children as they’re learning and developing those habits,” said Scottsdale Unified Superintendent Scott Menzel.\n\nFor years, Echo Canyon has incorporated a gardening program within the curriculum to help students learn new tools and eat healthier.\n\nEvery student has the opportunity to plant, harvest and try the food in the garden.\n\n“Gardens here at Echo Canyon help us support not only the academic learning as we look at science or social studies applications but it also helps our students foster social skills like cooperation and patience, and it also helps with those emotional skills, like learning failure is part of gardening, just as it is a part of life,” said principal Kat Hughes.\n\nEcho Canyon hopes they can lead by example for other schools across Arizona.\n\n“Ensuring our students develop those healthy habits is really important,” Menzel said.\n\nFor more information on Blue Zones, click/tap here.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

The swimsuits were $12.99 apiece.”\n\nAt the same time, Cameron was trying to get answers from Spirit Airlines.\n\nWhere were the two suitcases? For days, she didn’t get any answers.\n\n“A couple days into the cruise, I get a call from Alaska Airlines and they’re telling me, ‘Well, Nicole we have your bag,’” she recalled. “I’m like, ‘What?’ They’re like, ‘We have your bag.’ He said it was found on the tarmac. It was untagged. It was found on the tarmac and the only reason they knew that bag was mine was because of my old information tag that I had on there. The other bag was eventually found on the fifth day, but it was found by Delta.”\n\nWhen checked bags are delayed to their destination, travelers have rights.\n\n“You need to contact the airline as soon as possible, and that airline will start the process of locating your checked bag,” said Katy Nastro, a spokesperson for travel site Going.\n\nU.S. Department of Transportation regulations require airlines to compensate passengers for reasonable incidental expenses while the baggage is delayed.\n\nThat could include things like a change of clothes and toiletries.\n\n“With DOT really having eyes on the airlines moving forward, you should really see expenses when it comes to things like delayed bags or lost luggage to be even more speedy than they have been in the past,” Nastro said, but cautioned the claims process may be a negotiation. “When it comes to delayed bags and having a back and forth with the airlines, it’s really important to have receipts and time stamps on those receipts that match when your bag is delayed,” she said.\n\nCameron filed a claim with Spirit Airlines immediately. The airline asked her to resubmit receipts but has not said what it will reimburse.\n\nThe airline has not answered any of On Your Side’s questions.\n\n“I just want them to be accountable. I want them to have a better policy for when things do happen, and I do think people need to be reimbursed, especially if you had to spend extra money that you didn’t think you needed to spend,” Cameron said. “I just think there needs to be a reimbursement process, a better one.”\n\nWhen it comes to baggage that is lost, rather than delayed, there are varying policies across airlines.\n\nSome will declare a bag lost after about four days, while others will wait up to two weeks.\n\nTravelers are entitled to compensation of up to $3,800 for lost baggage, and airlines are allowed to pay more than that.\n\nAirlines must also refund any baggage fees that were paid.\n\n“We always suggest taking a photo of your bag before you check it, just opening it up, taking a quick snap of all the contents, so that you can have photographic evidence to back up your memory in case your bag does get misplaced and you need to cite all of its contents,” Nastro said. “That can really be a big life saver and time saver when you’re having to make that claim.”\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

State lawmakers gave the teen an extended round of applause from the House floor before Wednesday’s final vote.\n\nThe criminal case against the now-fired high school basketball coach and Suns superfan known as “Mr. ORNG” has brought renewed attention to the concept of “grooming” — the act of enticing a child into sexual behavior. However, the push to change Arizona’s sex crimes law this session started with an incident in a different part of the Valley – and a different high school coach.\n\n“Anne” (a pseudonym) was a 14-year-old freshman on the girls’ softball team when she said her coach started texting her personal details about his life, including his first sexual experiences.\n\nShe said the coach, a man in his 30s who was also a teacher, insisted she visit his classroom alone, where they would spend long periods on his couch.\n\n“There was a time when we’re sitting on the couch, side by side. His hand would go up the bottom of my shorts, up my back,” Anne said. “However, he never went a step further.”\n\nThe principal eventually discovered them alone in a locked classroom, prompting Anne’s family to go to the police.\n\nAccording to a police report, detectives reviewed the coach’s cellphone and found messages where he professed his love to the 14-year-old and made several references to wanting to hug her. “My job and softball mean absolutely nothing compared to you for me. Hence why I’d risk it all to be with you,” the coach texted, according to the report.\n\nIn another instance, the report quotes the coach as writing, “I wish I could give you a hug right now. Or a bigger couch so we can actually. Lay.”\n\nThe coach also urged the teen to delete her text messages “so they don’t find out,” according to the document.\n\nThe police department that handled the case recommended felony charges against the coach, but ultimately the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office declined to prosecute, citing “burden of proof” issues.\n\n“The police officer who investigated your daughter’s case said this was the worst case of grooming he’s seen in his 35-year career, and yet there was nothing they could do?” I asked Anne’s mother.\n\n“Correct,” she replied. “When you see something done to your kid, there’s really nothing worse. And when you can’t get the justice that they deserve, it’s a horrible feeling as a parent.”\n\nAnne’s case has an important distinction from the ongoing prosecution of Mr. ORNG, whose real name is Patrick Battillo. In Battillo’s case, prosecutors allege he asked for sexually graphic photos and videos. Battillo has pleaded not guilty.\n\nAnne’s case lacked such explicit requests. Although Anne told police the coach touched her buttocks and thigh, prosecutors declined to file charges for sexual assault. According to the family, prosecutors explained they can only bring charges for sexual assault when a person touches a victim’s crotch or chest. Additionally, prosecutors said they couldn’t bring a harassment charge because Anne didn’t object.\n\nThat explanation is unsettling to Anne’s mother. “The only way they would stop him is if he actually completed the act. By the grace of God, he didn’t get that far. But there was a lot of damage that’s been done.”\n\nDetermined to protect other children, the family contacted state Rep. Travis Grantham, who introduced a bill defining “grooming” as a criminal offense. Grantham told a committee the bill was designed to fill gaps in existing law that make it difficult to prosecute predators who are seeking to establish an inappropriate sexual relationship but have not yet engaged in criminal physical contact.\n\nWhen the bill was first heard by the House Judiciary Committee in January, it was met with resistance by the ACLU and some liberal groups. Critics argued the bill could criminalize teachers and other innocent acts aimed at educating teens about sexual health. They also claimed the term “grooming” itself had become an anti-LGBTQ+ slur.\n\nIn response, Grantham amended the bill to replace the word “grooming” with “child enticement.” He also added language to clarify the measure could not be used to prosecute adults displaying images for legitimate sexual education.

Pictures’ action adventure “FURIOSA: A MAD MAX SAGA,” a Warner Bros. Pictures release.(Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures)\n\nPHOENIX (AZFamily) — Rev up your engines, because it’s time to go mad!\n\nSynopsis\n\nSet many years before the events of Mad Max: Fury Road, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga tells the backstory of Furiosa (Anya Taylor-Joy), who, as a child, was kidnapped and forced to watch her mother be executed at the hands of warlord Dementus (Chris Hemsworth).\n\nFuriosa is able to escape Dementus’ grasp, making it her life’s goal to get revenge. To do so, she clandestinely infiltrates warlord Immortan Joe’s (Lachy Hulme) clan, rising through his ranks to help him conquer the wasteland and take down Dementus.\n\nMy thoughts\n\nMad Max: Fury Road is the kind of movie that, simply put, should have never been as great as it turned out to be. It was a 30-year later sequel with a tumultuous 17-year-long production history, made by original franchise mastermind George Miller, who was now in his mid-60s and coming off kid’s films like Babe and Happy Feet. Everything seemed to be going against it, yet it turned out to be not just one of the best films of the 2010′s, but arguably the greatest action film ever made.\n\nCharlize Theron’s Imperator Furiosa was the big standout star and fan favorite of Fury Road, but she was also the favorite of Miller and his co-writer Nick Lathouris. Before Fury Road was even filmed, they concocted an entire backstory for Furiosa to be explored in a future film.\n\nNot only would this give us more information into what made Furiosa who she is in Fury Road, but it also fills in more of the mad world she inhabits. I thought Theron’s Furiosa was awesome, but I wasn’t too enthusiastic about Miller’s next foray into the Mad Max universe being a prequel about her character (maybe it’s just the Tom Hardy fanboy in me).\n\nShifting gears\n\nMiller himself said the idea from Fury Road stemmed from him wondering if a car chase could last for an entire movie, and he executed that concept flawlessly. It was an action film that was constantly moving, with the plot, themes, and character details brilliantly intertwined with all of the breakneck carnage.\n\nFuriosa is less “Go, go, go!” than Fury Road, following a far more traditional narrative this time around. Since it’s a prequel exploring Furiosa and how the wasteland we see in Fury Road came to be, there’s far more plot and dense worldbuilding than what we got before. Instead of non-stop action, we get more dialogue, more characters, and more post-apocalyptic politics to drive the story forward.\n\nAt 148 minutes, it’s by far the longest Mad Max film, and you can definitely feel its length at times. There are a lot of plot elements and characters that are set up, and you can tell there was a lot of editing that went on in post-production, especially since we have two editors this time around, with Miller’s editor (and wife) Margaret Sixel being paired up with Eliot Knapman to cut the film.\n\nIt’s all still very engaging, but due to the denser story, longer timeline, and choppier editing, Furiosa does somewhat lack the kinetic energy that made films like Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior and Fury Road such classics. The first half contains numerous fades to black, time jumps, and some repetitive bits that make it all feel a little bit disjointed.\n\nPreventing prequel pitfalls\n\nIn terms of plot, structure, pacing, and action, if Fury Road was basically a modern version of The Road Warrior, then Furiosa feels almost like a modern version of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (although far less lame).\n\nI wasn’t really sure what direction Miller was going to take a Furiosa prequel in, but I respect him and Lathouris for not just making the same movie again. While I’m sure another giant chase movie would have been great, the attempt to do something different is much appreciated.\n\nWhat’s nice is that Miller and Lathouris put in their best effort to avoid all of your typical prequel tropes that often plague them. Sure, we get to know how Furiosa gets her mechanical arm, gets into the good graces of Immortan Joe, and all that, but it tells its own story that stands completely on its own two feet.\n\nYou don’t need to have seen Fury Road to enjoy this story, and even if you have, it’s one of those rare prequels where, no matter what’s happening, you can still feel the tension and serious stakes of the story. Sure, you know Furiosa will survive and where she’ll eventually end up, but how she got there and how the other characters influence that is just as compelling.\n\nWaste(land) management\n\nWhile there’s definitely more depth and plot to be found in Furiosa compared to your usual Mad Max fare, that doesn’t mean that Miller skimps on the action. There’s still plenty of that to be found here, it’s just that the plot necessitates less of it to tell its story.\n\nIn Miller’s films, action scenes don’t just happen for action’s sake. They need to actually serve the characters and their journey in some way, and that still applies in Furiosa. Since the first hour is spent on Furiosa as a child (Alyla Brown), it’s not until she becomes an adult that we get into what you might call the “Mad Max goods.”\n\nWhen Miller delivers those goods to you, it’s clear the man hasn’t lost a step since Fury Road. Like before, all of the action is clear as day, expertly staged and choreographed by Miller and his cinematographer Simon Duggan to never let the audience lose sight of what’s happening on screen.\n\nFury Road was such an insane and dangerous film to make, it’s no surprise that Miller and stunt coordinator Guy Norris (no relation, sadly) didn’t take things even further than they did before. With less risk-taking and relying more on some iffy-looking digital effects, it wasn’t as gritty, but the passion was still there.\n\nThe epic feats, stunts, and explosions never quite achieve the jaw-dropping heights of Fury Road, but that doesn’t mean the action isn’t exciting to watch and doesn’t pack some decent surprises. Nobody makes action sequences quite like madman George Miller and his crazy crew, that’s for sure.\n\nAll mad… no Max!\n\nThis is the first film in the franchise to not feature the titular Max, and while that may seem odd at first, Miller and his crew prove that you don’t particularly need Max for this world to remain mad.\n\nThere is the character Praetorian Jack (Tom Burke), one of Immortan Joe’s trusted war rig drivers. He somewhat fills the role of a Max surrogate here, an experienced driver who knows the wasteland like the back of his hand, surviving for years on his own skills and instincts.\n\nHe ends up passing these skills down to Furiosa, while also providing her some hope that society and her fellow man aren’t entirely bad. The heart and spirit of the Mad Max films is kept intact, with themes of redemption, revenge, and keeping your humanity intact in a world that’s mostly losing it.\n\nWhile Anya Taylor-Joy may not look all that similar to Charlize Theron if you put them side by side, she more than embodies the character of Furiosa. It’s an impressive performance that more than carries the second half of the film, even if she barely speaks any dialogue.\n\nJust like Max in the other films, though, she doesn’t really need to speak that much dialogue. Miller is one of those masterful visual storytellers who can give you everything you need to know about a character without a word ever being said.\n\nYou really just need the right actor to pull that off, and Anya Taylor-Joy was more than ready for the task. Like Tom Hardy in Fury Road, she’s absolutely ferocious in the lead role, using her unique body language and insanely expressive eyes to convey a whole range of emotions.\n\nLike Theron before her, she’s just as convincing in the action scenes, influencing her performance with the same type of intense ferocity that Theron did in Fury Road. Taylor-Joy is a terrific actress who will no doubt continue to star in more dramatic roles, but she’s now also proven herself to be quite the action star.\n\nChris Hemsworth is the big scene stealer here, which is definitely by design, being written as the type of bad guy who just loves himself and wants everybody to know it. I mean, I kind of loved him. The dude had a motorized chariot!\n\nHe’s the best kind of bad guy who you just love to hate. We get Hemsworth’s trademark charm and charisma here, but it’s a different brand than his other characters like Thor. He can be hilariously fun to watch in one moment, but it is absolutely terrifying in the next.\n\nOut of all of the Mad Max antagonists, he definitely seems to have the most going for him, and Hemsworth was clearly having the time of his life. Dementus is a despicable, eccentric character, but you can still sense the humanity buried within all the darkness inside.\n\nFinal verdict\n\nIf you go into Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga expecting it to be as rockin’ and rollin’ as Fury Road, then you may walk out disappointed. While everything looks familiar on the surface, it’s a completely different beast of a movie that’s operating in a lower gear than Mad Max usually runs at.\n\nThis isn’t a bad thing, because if you go into Furiosa wanting more exploration into the crazy Mad Max world and the Furiosa character, all done with George Miller’s signature direction and style, then it’s more than worth your time to take another road trip out into the wasteland.\n\nMiller said that the script is completed and he’s ready to go for another Mad Max adventure. Let’s just hope we don’t have to wait another decade to experience another lovely day.\n\nMy rating: 8.5/10\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga will open in theaters nationwide on Friday, May 24th.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

So Baird said knowing your limits and preparing are crucial to preventing a rescue.\n\n“We’re up here at 7,000 feet at the South Rim,” she said. “Generally speaking, it’s about a 20-degree difference between the south rim and down at Phantom Ranch at the bottom of the canyon so really checking the weather ahead of time.

He could face life in prison.\n\nMeixner, 52, headed the university’s Department of Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences. Dervish was in the master’s degree program in atmospheric sciences.\n\nAuthorities said Dervish was banned from the school in January 2022 and later expelled for ongoing issues with professors after he received a bad grade.\n\n“The fact that they came to such a quick verdict makes me believe at the close of the case they did not believe the insanity claim,” said Russ Richelsoph, a criminal defense attorney unaffiliated with the case.\n\nThe trial saw several dramatic moments during testimony, but perhaps some of the most memorable were outbursts Murad Dervish had in the courtroom.\n\nCould that have been a tactic by Dervish’s attorneys to aid in their insanity defense?\n\nRichelsoph said he doubts it.\n\n“If lawyers were to coach a client like that to have outbursts in court, it would be an ethical violation, and it would be a serious ethical violation,” said Richelsoph.\n\nBut it may not have taken any direction from lawyers if Dervish personally believed it could help his case.\n\n“Is it possible the defendant himself thought that this was a tactic that might convince the jury he was insane? Possibly,” said Richelsoph.\n\nDefense attorney Leo Masursky told jurors in his closing argument Monday that Dervish was in the midst of a psychotic episode at the time of the shooting and the crime wasn’t premeditated.\n\nHe also said his client was guilty except insane of second-degree murder. That would confine Dervish to a psychiatric hospital instead of a prison cell if he was convicted.\n\n“Murad Dervish lost his mind on Oct. 5, 2022,” Masursky said in his closing argument. “He had severe mental health issues. He did not know right from wrong.”\n\nBut Pima County prosecutor Mark Hotchkiss said evidence showed Dervish planned Meixner’s killing and bought the murder weapon - a 9 mm handgun - a month before the shooting.\n\n“He is not guilty but insane. He’s just guilty,” Hotchkiss said of Dervish.\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint, a flyer with a photograph of Dervish had been circulated to university staff in February 2022 with instructions to call 911 if Dervish ever entered the John W. Harshbarger Building, which houses the hydrology department.\n\nThe complaint also said Dervish was barred from school property and he had been the subject of several reports of harassment and threats to staff members working at Harshbarger.\n\nWitnesses testified that Dervish was wearing a surgical mask and baseball cap as a disguise when he showed up outside Meixner’s office and shot the professor on the afternoon of Oct. 5, 2022.\n\nDervish fled the scene but was arrested three hours later after Arizona state troopers stopped his car on a highway more than 120 miles (190 kilometers) northwest of Tucson.\n\nAuthorities said a loaded handgun was found in the vehicle and that the ammunition was consistent with the shell casings found at the shooting scene.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

He was severely injured after an attack by a group of teens with brass knuckles at an In-N-Out back in 2022.\n\nHe shared his story with the town council before the vote and is happy with their vote.\n\n“I think it’s a big step towards teen violence. I think it shows the community that Gilbert and Chandler are working on teen violence actively and we aren’t going to let it slip by us. I think even preventing one brass knuckle attack in the future my goal will be fulfilled,” said Jarnagan.\n\nHe’s working to bring this topic up to the state Legislature next year.\n\n“Next year, we’re gonna bring it back to the state. I think this year, with it being an election year, things were kind of tough but next year if we can get an actual vote on it that would be great,” Jarnagan said.\n\nUp next at the town council meeting was the ordinance on unruly gatherings, which also passed unanimously.\n\nIt makes any homeowner or landlord responsible if a party gets out of hand. There were questions about enforcement, especially in cases of New Year’s parties.\n\nThe police chief explained that it would be up to the officer’s discretion if the ordinance was violated. That officer would also have to explain their reasoning as well.\n\nThe first violation of this ordinance is a $500 fine. The next violation will be a misdemeanor. An exception is if the homeowner could prove they had no idea the party was going on.\n\nThe topic of brass knuckles and unruly parties is far from over here in the East Valley.

Hernandez said. “The thing we can always encourage everybody to do is if you or your loved one is experiencing crisis, mental health issues, is to seek treatment.”\n\nHe said the first step can be to call 988, the suicide and crisis lifeline.\n\n‘Weighing a heavy toll’\n\nIt’s the second domestic violence situation involving children in Surprise in only a matter of days.\n\nLast Friday, a 7-month-old boy was shot multiple times by his father before being rescued by officers responding to reports of a hostage situation. The house burned down following an hours-long standoff, and 51-year-old Todd Christopher Marchetti was found dead the next day after taking his own life.\n\nThat young boy, Jaxson, has already had at least three surgeries and is expected to survive.\n\nSgt. Hernandez says many of the same officers responded to both scenes.\n\n“Our department is rocked,” Sgt. Hernandez said. “I will share with you that a number of the officers who responded to the hostage situation on May 17, they were the officers that responded yesterday.”\n\nHe said those officers are off duty on Tuesday.\n\n“They are with their loved ones, trying to recover and recuperate,” he added. “It’s weighing a heavy toll.”\n\nPsychologist Michael Klinkner said community members will also need time to process the events that have hit the city of Surprise so hard. That’s even more true for family members and friends.\n\n“Grief is rough, grief with children is so incredibly rough,” Klinkner said. “For a child, the grief that they are gone is also there but the life that they could have lived.”\n\nAs far as Mater’s mental health history, Klinkner believes there were signs that were missed before the shooting.\n\n“For signs of homicidal ideation, you are going to see an escalation in mood and anger and chaotic behavior and irritability and those kinds of things. They are also probably going to discuss that they are having thoughts of doing something like that,” said Klinkner.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

Alex Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said authorities were still determining the total number but thought they had accounted for all of the town’s residents.\n\nDinkla said there were at least a dozen injuries amid widespread devastation in Greenfield, including at the community’s small hospital. Patients there had to be transferred to other facilities in nearby cities.\n\nThe Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there.\n\nStorms spun up fierce tornados in Iowa Tuesday that took down several 250-foot wind turbines and caused extensive damage in at least one rural town. (KCCI)\n\nAuthorities said they would only allow residents to enter Greenfield until Wednesday morning and ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Cars lay busted and bent while damaged houses sat skewed against the gray and overcast sky. Trees stood — barely — bereft of branches or leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings from mounds of debris or from homes barely left standing.\n\nRogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky.\n\n“But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped,” Paxton said. “Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything’s going to be fine because we have each other, but it’s just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess.”\n\nMultiple tornadoes were reported throughout the state, and one also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air and continued to smolder hours later.\n\nWind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, turbines are designed to shut off when winds exceed certain thresholds, typically around 55 mph (88.5 kph). They also lock and feather their blades, and turn into the wind, to minimize the strain.\n\nThe town bills itself as “the friendly wave as you walk” type of place with tree-lined streets — before the storm — and “the crack of the fireworks or twinkle of the lights” on special holidays. Also touting itself as the “perfect place to grow,” Greenfield prides itself on being a town where business owners know your name and neighbors help neighbors, according to its visitors page.\n\nPeople sort through the remains of a home damaged by a tornado Tuesday, May 21, 2024, in Greenfield, Iowa. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)(AP)\n\nMary Long, the owner of Long’s Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community’s historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town.\n\n“I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done,” she said.\n\nCamille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. She emerged from her home to describe widespread damage and scattered debris.\n\n“There’s a pretty significant roof damage to several houses that I know will need whole new roofs,” she said. “And I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road.”\n\nIn far southwestern Iowa, video posted to social media showed a tornado just northwest of Red Oak. Further east and north, the National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings for areas near the towns of Griswold, Corning, Fontanelle and Guthrie Center, among others.\n\nIowa was already braced for severe weather after the National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. Des Moines public schools ended classes two hours early and canceled all evening activities ahead of the storms.\n\nThe storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin Tuesday evening and night, including a warning for the state’s capital city of Madison.\n\nStorms spun up fierce tornados in Iowa Tuesday that took down several 250-foot wind turbines and caused extensive damage in at least one rural town. (KCCI)\n\nEarlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to weather sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters arriving to rescue people from vehicles.\n\nIn Illinois, dust storms forced authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. Winds gusts of between 35 mph (56 kph) and 45 mph (74 kph) hit the McLean area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck Schaffer.\n\n“There is no visibility at times,” state police posted on the social media platform X.\n\nThe storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma.\n\nAnother round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. Front-end loaders were used to move half-foot (15.24-centimeter) deep hail Tuesday.\n\nLast week, deadly storms hit the Houston area in Texas, killing at least eight people. Those storms Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving those Texans in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. The total of deaths was raised Tuesday from seven to include a man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning while running a generator after his power went out. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers.\n\nTuesday’s storms were expected to bring much of the same high winds, heavy rain and large hail to Minnesota and part of northern Missouri, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\nHe said the system is expected to turn south on Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the conversion of a half-foot depth of hail to 15.24 centimeters, not 1.83 meters.\n\n___\n\nMcFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa, and Beck reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

This is a joke. This is a joke,” said Cierra Walling, a condo owner.\n\nThat was Walling’s reaction when learning about the permit issue.\n\nIn February, Arizona’s Family first reported about the sinkhole that had been growing for about two years.\n\nThen, a couple months later, residents reached out again saying another sinkhole popped up.\n\nAs the sinkhole kept growing, so did the frustration from homeowners who said their property managers are failing to fix the sinkhole.\n\nRight before the beginning of May, construction to replace an old water tank that caused the sinkhole began.\n\nNow, Walling and other homeowners Arizona’s Family talked with off camera are wondering why their property managers were not on top of making sure the permit was secured.\n\n“Well, if you didn’t get these permits, then how are you doing construction under the guidelines of OSHA? How are you ensuring the safety of the residents that are there,” said Walling.\n\nThe City Property Management sent out a digital announcement to residents, stating a resident complained to the city and that led to construction at the sinkhole to stop for three days.\n\nThe memo also said these delays can be easily avoided.\n\nWalling doesn’t accept that excuse.\n\n“I was frustrated.

In fact, he’s had the same cellphone provider for two decades.\n\nOn Your Side’s Gary Harper asked, “You were happy with them?” Bird replied, “Yes. I was happy with the service. You know, they never did wrong by me.”\n\nWhich is why he can’t believe what he got himself mixed up with.\n\nBird said he recently went to a major retailer to buy a birthday gift. Once inside, he said he was approached by an AT&T salesman standing at an authorized kiosk trying to drum up business.\n\nBird said he usually ignores aggressive sales pitches.\n\n“I normally just say, ‘no thank you,’ or ‘I’m not interested.’ You know, and keep walking. But not this day,” he said.\n\nBird said he actually found himself at the kiosk talking to the AT&T salesman, who reportedly made all kinds of big promises if Bird would just switch his cell service to AT&T. One of those promises was that Bird could save a lot of money.\n\nBird said the salesman showed him AT&T’s monthly rate, which was nearly $40 less than what he was currently paying.\n\nAnd here’s the kicker: Bird said the salesman claimed AT&T had a buyout campaign that would pay off his old contract and even pay off his phones, which all totaled around $1,508.\n\n“I thought, AT&T wants my businesses so bad that they’re willing to payoff my contract and payoff my old phones?” Bird told On Your Side.\n\nSo Bird accepted the deal, and that’s when he was told to sign his name in three different areas on an iPad that contained AT&T’s digital contract.\n\n“He’s just scrolling and scrolling then says, ‘Sign here.’ Scrolling and scrolling, ‘sign here.’ Scrolling and scrolling, ‘sign here.’ I was like, good grief,” said Bird.\n\nWhat Bird didn’t see was that the iPad contained an 18-page digital contract, a contract he never read because it was all on the salesman’s iPad.\n\nRemember, Jason said all he was told was to just sign his name.\n\nBut when the digital contract was emailed to Jason later, it said nothing at all about paying $1,508 to buyout his old contract or his phones.\n\nHarper asked, “Did your heart kind of drop?” Bird responded, “I was like this doesn’t sound good.”\n\nBird spent weeks complaining to AT&T about that salesman and the sales pitch, but he got nowhere. Ultimately, Bird paid his old carrier $1,508 out of pocket. Then, he contacted On Your Side.\n\n“I did. I reached out to you because after all of my complaining and talking on the phone it just seems I’m getting nowhere,” Bird said.\n\nOn Your Side asked AT&T to investigate Bird’s issue and hopefully resolve his problem by releasing him from the contract or at least reimbursing him the $1,508 he had to pay out of pocket to get released from his previous cellphone contract.\n\nWhile On Your Side waits for a final decision, Bird said he believes there are many others who have been duped by an aggressive salesman.\n\n“How many people do you think are out there that did what you did?” Harper asked.\n\n“Well, I’ve always heard for every one person who complains, there are 10 others who didn’t,” Bird said.\n\nWhen making any big purchase or commitment, On Your Side recommends not relying on a salesman’s promises alone.\n\nAlways read and understand what you are getting involved in, and do not sign blank iPad screens.\n\nAgain, AT&T continues to investigate what happened to Bird. Once they reach a decision to release or reimburse him, On Your Side will let you know in a follow-up news report.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

Giuliani was finally served Friday night as he was walking to a car after his 80th birthday celebration.\n\nGiuliani said he did not have an attorney at this time but will. When asked by the court whether he needed counsel appointed for the arraignment, Giuliani said: “No, no, I think I am capable of handling it myself.”\n\nGiuliani said he received a summons but did not have a copy of the indictment. He said he is familiar with the charges, though, by reading about them.\n\nThe former mayor had asked the court to waive a requirement for the bond as he had successfully appeared in other cases.\n\n“I haven’t been hiding from anyone,” he told the court by phone.\n\nArizona authorities unveiled the felony charges last month against Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring Trump, a Republican, had won Arizona. The defendants include five lawyers connected to the former president and two former Trump aides. Biden, a Democrat, won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes.\n\nFormer Arizona Republican Party chair Kelli Ward also appeared. The indictment alleges Ward, a former state senator who led the GOP in Arizona from 2019 until early 2023, organized the fake electors and urged then-Vice President Mike Pence to declare them to be the state’s true electors. It says Ward failed to withdraw her vote as a fake elector even though no legal challenges changed the outcome of the presidential race in Arizona. Her trial date is set for Oct. 17, about 3 weeks before the General Election.\n\nLast week, attorney John Eastman, who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election, was the first defendant in the case to be arraigned, pleading not guilty to the charges.\n\nRead More: Full, unredacted copy of Arizona fake electors indictment released\n\nTrump himself was not charged in the Arizona case but was referred to as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nArizona is the fourth state where allies of the former president have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election.\n\nThe 11 people who claimed to be Arizona’s Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were “duly elected and qualified” electors and asserting that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nOf eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden’s victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 fake Arizona electors, who had asked a federal judge to decertify the results and block the state from sending its results to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, the judge concluded the Republicans had “failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.” Days after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 participated in the certificate signing.\n\nThose set to be arraigned Tuesday are Ward; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA; state Sen.

At least one woman was shot to death and two others narrowly escaped. In at least one of the situations, the victim had filed a protection order against their attacker.\n\nIt begs the question, how much does an order of protection truly protect you?\n\nProtection orders are civil court orders prohibiting a specific person from making contact with you. It prohibits the person from coming near your home, work, school, or other places for at least one year since the order was filed. Often times these are issued by a judge in cases of harassment and domestic violence.\n\nResources available for domestic violence survivors in Phoenix area\n\nSurvivor advocates say domestic violence is a lot more common than many of us realize. Data shows one in four women will experience it at some point in their lives, along with one in seven men.\n\n“You never know when something like this is going to happen, an incident like this is going to occur, but if you feel like it’s building up to that point it’s better to have a plan in place,” said Emily Perea, Victim Advocate for the City Of Phoenix Family Advocacy Center.\n\nAdvocates for survivors of domestic violence say having a safety plan is key. A piece of that plan could be a protective order.\n\n“The good thing about having an order of protection is that it’s a documented record that there is violence already occurring,” she said.\n\nProtective orders can all be done online and there are ways to get them without abusers using that information to track you down.\n\n“It can be done in any jurisdiction. If you don’t want an abuser to know you’re in phoenix, you can get your order of protection in another jurisdiction,” said Kate Thoene, the Chief Strategy Officer at New Life Center.\n\nIn an interview last week, the mother of a domestic violence survivor told us her daughter filed a protective order after her family says she was beaten by ex-boyfriend Jamarr Young.\n\n“We thought that we had accomplished that but then last night he showed up here at our home and assaulted her again,” she said.\n\nYoung was booked on 11 charges, including assault in connection to the domestic violence incident. In this case, the family says the protective order did not protect her or her family.\n\n“She has two black eyes and it was quite a thing. He threatened to kill her and her kids, unfortunately,” said the victim’s mother.\n\nExperts we spoke with are both in agreement saying order of protections are just one tool. “At the end of the day an order of protection is just one part of a safety plan. There are times when people even with an order of protection even find themselves in harms way,” said Perea.\n\n“It’s not for everyone and it’s not for every situation. At New Life Center we really feel the survivor is the expert of their own life and they will know if it will provoke or if it will be a safer environment if an order of protection is served,” said Thoene.\n\nIn any case, help is available. The domestic violence hotline 24/7 is available at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or by texting “Start” to 88788.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

Baby Boomers haven’t saved enough for retirement, and now a growing number of older adults are moving in with their grown children to make ends meet.\n\n“The average median retirement income for Baby Boomers today is $202,000,” said Shane Stevenson from Winston & Companies Retirement and Financial Services. “When you think about that and the average retirement spending of about $51,000 a year, that $200,000 nest egg is not going to go far at all.”\n\nWith the mismatch in retirement income and living expenses, something has to give.\n\n“We’re seeing a lot of people actually start to think about moving in together with other relatives,” Stevenson said, noting the cost of child care, elder care and housing are the driving factors pushing people to multigenerational living.\n\nMultigenerational living can be financially beneficial to all parties. In many cases, Baby Boomer grandparents are helping with child care, significantly easing the burden of skyrocketing daycare and babysitting costs.\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center, the number of people living in multigenerational homes quadrupled from 1971 to 2021 to nearly 60 million. Most are adult children living in their parents’ homes, commonly referred to as the boomerang effect. Pew has also documented an uptick in the “reverse boomerang effect,” where grown children are the head of the household, shared with a parent.\n\n“It’s a pretty big change, and aside from just the relationship change that’s going to take place, you’ve got to make sure that you’re not going to pinch yourself or set yourself up for a sticky situation down the road,” Stevenson said. “Start to build a budget. Maybe even get some contracts written up to say, ‘Here’s how we’re going to share expenses. Here’s who is responsible for X, Y, and Z.’”\n\nFor retirees and soon-to-be retirees, it’s also important to keep saving.\n\n“You want to start looking at all of your assets and make sure they’re all positioned in the most effective way possible for you, especially if you’re still working,” Stevenson said. “Make sure you’re getting your match in your 401K if you can. Get that free money, but anything over the match, we’d recommend putting somewhere else and letting that really start to grow in those last couple years until retirement to try to boost up your retirement nest egg.”\n\nFor the younger generations, time is your friend.\n\n“It’s absolutely critical that you start saving as soon as possible,” Stevenson said.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

Do I have to borrow money?” said economist Danny Court with Elliott D. Pollack and Company.\n\nCourt said despite stubborn inflation, the economy is doing better than expected. He said unemployment is still at historically low levels, despite some recent headlines announcing layoffs at certain companies and startups.\n\n“Overall, layoffs are at historically low levels, we’re at 3.8% unemployment, that’s basically full employment,” Court said. “We’re increasing jobs at a 2.2% rate.

And when we see that big wave of supply, that usually means there’s going to be more apartments coming online with people moving here, needing an apartment, so you’re gonna see more concessions, maybe some rent decreases.”\n\nAs for home prices, Court said don’t expect prices to come down in this market.\n\n“There’s absolutely nothing, nothing in the housing market that would suggest that the prices are going to come down,” he said. “We still have a housing shortage.

(AP) — Former Arizona State and current Georgia quarterback Jaden Rashada is suing Florida Gators coach Billy Napier and the program’s top booster over a failed name, image and likeness deal worth nearly $14 million.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Pensacola accuses Napier and booster and automotive technology businessman Hugh Hathcock of fraudulent misrepresentation and inducement, aiding and abetting fraud, civil conspiracy to commit fraud, negligent misrepresentations, tortious inference with a business relationship or contract, aiding and abetting tortious interference and vicarious liability. The complaint seeks a jury trial and damages of at least $10 million.\n\n“Sadly, this type of fraud is becoming more commonplace in the Wild West that is today’s college NIL landscape,” said attorney Rusty Hardin, who is representing Rashada. “Wealthy alumni, consumed by their schools’ athletic programs, are taking advantage of young people by offering them life-changing sums of money, only to renege on their commitments.\n\n“As the first scholar-athlete to take a stand against this egregious behavior, Jaden seeks to hold these defendants accountable for their actions and to expose their as-yet unchecked abuse of power.”\n\nFlorida had been under NCAA investigation since last June regarding Rashada’s recruitment. The NCAA asked the school not to conduct its own investigation and said it would notify the institution “soon regarding the projected timeline of the investigation.”\n\nBut in March, the NCAA halted investigations into booster-backed collectives or other third parties making NIL compensation deals with Division I athletes.\n\nThe Gators may have thought they were off the hook. But Rashada’s lawsuit puts them back in the spotlight, at the very least.\n\nRashada, who threw for 5,275 yards and 59 touchdowns at Pittsburg (California) High School, initially agreed to play for Miami in the fall of 2022. According to the lawsuit, the Hurricanes promised Rashada a $9.5 million NIL deal.\n\nNapier and Hathcock lured Rashada from his Miami commitment with an NIL deal worth $13.85 million, which violated NCAA bylaws, the suit said. The lawsuit says Napier vouched for the collective and said Rashada would receive $1 million on signing day.\n\n“But before Rashada could arrive on Florida’s campus, the ... contract was terminated — suddenly and without warning,” according to the suit.\n\nRashada was granted his release a month later after his NIL deal fell through. He later signed with his father’s alma mater, Arizona State. He spent one season in Tempe before landing at Florida’s biggest rival, Georgia.\n\nRashada bailed on Florida after the Gator Collective — an independent fundraising group that was loosely tied to the university and paid student-athletes for use of their NIL — failed to honor a multiyear deal that was signed by both sides.\n\nThe bombshell came a little more than two months after Rashada switched his verbal commitment from Miami to Florida.

Get the baby!” an officer is heard yelling several times when they located the wounded 7-month-old boy named Jaxson.\n\nAn officer is then seen picking up the child and running him out of the house.\n\nOn Monday, first responders provided the video along with additional information about the situation last Friday that left the boy hospitalized, the suspect dead and a home burned to the ground following an hours-long standoff.\n\nThe incident began around 3 a.m. on Friday when police say 51-year-old Todd Christopher Marchetti broke into the home near Cotton Lane and Cactus Road, then held his ex-girlfriend named Allie and his son Jaxson hostage for several hours.\n\nPolice say Allie worked to come up with several ruses, including taking the family dog to the veterinarian after Marchetti shot it.\n\nHe agreed and then told staff that the dog was a stray that had been hit by a car, and left a fake name and phone number.\n\nAllie was not able to reach out for help at the veterinarian’s office.\n\n“She was persistent, and she was able to come up with another ruse,” Surprise Police Sgt. Rick Hernandez said during a news conference Monday afternoon.\n\nHe said Allie convinced Marchetti to have workers fix the window he damaged while breaking into the home so no one would know what he was doing. Once outside, she approached nearby construction workers and asked them to call 911 for help.\n\n“I think she, by doing so, was able to save not only her life, but Jaxson’s life,” Sgt. Hernandez said.\n\nGunshots can be heard coming from inside the home before officers and a K-9 make their way inside. One officer fired a shot during the initial response, but none had directly encountered Marchetti.\n\nOn the body-cam video, as police worked to clear the kitchen area, a child could be heard crying in another room.\n\nAfter scooping up the boy, an officer runs him outside to a waiting SWAT medic. The medic provided initial care to the child, who was then taken to a medical helicopter and flown to Phoenix Children’s Hospital.\n\nMarchetti refused to come outside over the course of several hours as additional officers and SWAT units responded.\n\nThe home erupted in flames around 3 p.m., and because police didn’t know exactly where Marchetti was during the blaze, firefighters stayed back and sprayed the home with water from a distance.\n\nOn Saturday, a body believed to be that of Marchetti was found in the home dead after apparently shooting himself.\n\nJaxson has had at least three surgeries since the ordeal and is expected to survive. On Tuesday, his breathing tube and catheter were removed, family said.\n\n“He’s awake, he’ll open his eyes and we’ll rub his head, tell him we love him.” said Michael Norman, Jaxson’s grandfather.\n\nNorman says Allie is dealing with the emotional trauma.\n\n“When you see domestic violence happening, and your child is 31 years old, it’s not like I can grab her by the hand and tell her she needs to choose for herself; that’s not a good place to be,” he said, adding that she eventually ended the relationship and moved herself and Jaxson in with them.\n\nNorman said he and his wife were on a cruise when they heard what was happening on Friday afternoon.\n\n“To watch your house on TV burning to the ground, I don’t even know how to explain that to people, what you’re thinking,” he said.\n\n“If you’re a parent and somebody did that to them, I’m sure you would step in and wouldn’t let it go. And that’s what we did, we stepped in. And he was mad that we stepped in so he was going to punish us, and he did,” Norman said.\n\nBut he says what matters is that they still have their daughter and grandson.\n\n“[Jaxson’s] alive, he’s doing good, we need him in our life, and so we’re thankful,” Norman said.\n\nA GoFundMe account has been set up to help Allie and Jaxon.\n\nThere are resources available for domestic violence survivors.

He was at his son’s tee ball game in Surprise, jumped in his work truck, and drove 45 minutes to Chase Field. He arrived, took a scissor lift to the top of the net and vacuumed the bees.\n\n“When I went out onto the field, that’s when crowd started cheering, when they realized someone was there to take care of the bee situation, and I played to that,” said Hilton. “It was really cool, getting a couple fist bumps and getting the crowd going crazy.”\n\nHilton got a standing ovation and was asked to throw the first pitch. The game started at 8:35 p.m., two hours after the scheduled time.\n\nHowever, the fame didn’t end there. The father of four created a buzz on social media and signed a deal with Topps trading card company to make limited edition autograph trading cards, which sold 16,000 cards in 24 hours.\n\nThe Bee Guy’s bobblehead will be available on the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum’s online store for $30 plus a $8 shipping fee.

Michael says he was carried out of the street by good samaritans.\n\nNow, he is in the process of healing after multiple broken bones. “The tibia, the fibula, and well, basically, my whole foot is all crushed,” he said. “My life was actually saved, blessed, because I am actually here.”\n\nAbout a week before Michael’s crash, there was a deadly hit-and-run just two blocks away. Thirteen-year-old Elias Bizzle was hit while crossing on 47th and Northern Avenues. Bizzle later died from his injuries.\n\n“It upsets me. It makes me very angry because that is a high-traffic area and for someone to not even think about taking someone’s life or hitting someone without stopping. It’s inhumane,” said OrNail Fischer, Michael’s wife.\n\nOrNail says the past month has been hard on her entire family. Her children lost Bizzle, who was their classmate, and then their father was hit.\n\n“It’s been awful because they are telling us there are no cameras there, but there are two, three memorials right there where someone has lost their life,” she said.\n\nAn arrest has been made in Bizzle’s case, but Glendale police say Fischer’s case is inactive due to a lack of information.\n\n“They need to put more protection in the area,” OrNail said.\n\nGlendale police say they used surveillance footage from nearby security cameras and could not find a vehicle that matched the description.\n\nThe Fishers are now asking for more cameras and better lighting in that area.

Friends said she was a mother who was very involved in her kids’ lives and with the community.\n\nDavid showed police two handwritten notes that Sandra reportedly left behind: one to her kids saying she had to leave, and the other to David, leaving him all of her property and belongings.\n\n“The handwriting analysis showed those notes were in fact written by him,” said Mattox.\n\nWith David as a person of interest, Mattox said they gathered enough cell phone evidence that put him in the place Sandra Pagniano’s body would ultimately be found in a hand-dug grave.\n\n“She was also bound around the mouth and around the head so that she presumably would be unable to make any noise,” Mattox said. “She was alive at the time she was buried.”\n\nHorrifically, evidence showed she was likely conscious for up to five minutes after she was buried.\n\nThe Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office charged David Pagniano with first-degree murder, and the county attorney was pursuing the death penalty.\n\nBut on the eve of his trial, David decided to plead guilty and let the judge decide his fate.\n\nHe was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nDetective Mattox believes avoiding trial may protect their kids from more harm. He said they were eight and twelve years old at the time their mother was killed.\n\n“It spares all of them having to re-live all of those details,” said Mattox.\n\nMattox said that while justice is finally served, certain cases stick with you forever. For him, this is one of them.\n\n“There are things you experience, and you think you’d never be able to experience something worse, and then along comes something like this,” said Mattox.\n\nIn addition to the life sentence, David Pagniano was also sentenced to an additional 16 and a half years in prison for kidnapping Sandra, forging the notes, and fraud schemes.

(13 News) - It’s sticker shock for anyone opening their homeowner’s insurance notice this year but especially for those who have homes or cabins on Mount Lemmon.\n\n“You can’t get insurance and if you are getting insurance, it is ridiculously expensive,” said Jennifer Anram, an agent for Mount Lemmon Realty.\n\nShe said the homeowner’s insurance bill for a 1,500-square-foot cabin is $9,000 yearly.\n\nMore from Bud Boster\nTucson to lower speed limits on more streets as part of safe streets plan\nArizona Senate adjourns following no vote on controversial immigration bill\nTucson to sign water sharing agreements with three Phoenix-area communities\nPima County wants Biden Admin to designate parts of Santa Cruz River wildlife refuge\nTucson, Pima County join forces to fight fentanyl, host of other community issues\n\nSome owners have had policies double or triple. Others may be going without.\n\nIt’s a double whammy for the residents who live in the Catalina Mountains.\n\n“We have the highest taxes in the state of Arizona here on Mount Lemmon,” she said. “Now we’re having the highest insurance and you can’t even get insurance.”\n\nAnd that’s because “literally companies are calling and saying we’re dropping you.”\n\nIf they can get it and keep it, it can cost a small fortune. The Sawmill Restaurant has seen its rates double. The Mount Lemmon Hotel insurance rates have also doubled and so have the rates for the General Store.\n\nMost of the folks here believe the higher costs are not of their own making.\n\n“You know, I talk to insurance agents, it’s because of all the fires in California,” Anram said. “You know it shouldn’t affect Mount Lemmon because of what happens in California or what happens in Florida, but it does.”\n\nMount Lemmon has seen two devastating forest fires in the past 20 years. The Bullock Fire in 2002 and the Aspen Fire in 2003, which wiped out much of the community.\n\nThe community learned some hard lessons from those fires. They now have a strictly enforced firewise program, 44 fire hydrants, seven firefighters, and an attitude.\n\n“I think they’ve recognized what the risks are and the exposure and have taken some really drastic steps in their communities to do all they can to prevent wildfires and damage to their homes,” said Steve Christy, the District 4 Pima County Supervisor, whose district includes the mountain enclave.\n\nBut despite those efforts, the new bills can be shocking.\n\nIt affects their home values, makes it harder to buy or sell, or even to build, which is why Christy will ask the board to ask the state for help.\n\n“Through whatever means either the Governor’s office or the Department of Insurance or our lobbyist Mr. (Michael) Racy to seek ways to get some sort of relief or at least stabilize the situation with insurance companies,” Christy says.\n\nHe said it’s not limited to Mount Lemmon but that communities all over the country are facing the same big bump in premiums because of catastrophic events.\n\n“The wildfires have caused such damage, billions of dollars in damage and if they’re going to underwrite it, everybody is going to have to take some part of the exposure in that according to the underwriters,” Christy said. “And in consequence, they have risen dramatically.”\n\nChristy said he hopes to get unanimous approval from the board to approach the state for help and solutions.\n\nThe board will hear the item at its meeting on Tuesday, May 21.\n\nThe average price for homeowners insurance in Arizona now sits around $2,100 annually and is expected to rise again in 2025 because of hurricanes on the East Coast and wildfires on the West Coast.\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the 13 News YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/@13newskold\n\nCopyright 2024 13 News.

These kids, at the end of the day, just want to be accepted, loved,” added house manager Lyric Donnell.\n\nIt’s the impact on the kids that is the hardest for these providers to understand.\n\n“There has been no thought process, no discussion on how these kids who have already experienced significant trauma are going to be able to transition,” says Village De Amor President Monessa Duran. “The dollars drive the decision.”\n\n“The Department confirms that through the competitive request for proposal process 52 Congregate Care contracts were awarded this week. There were 16 providers that ultimately were not awarded. There are approximately 200 children that will need to be transitioned in the next 5 months into new settings- preferably a family setting whenever possible. The contracts not awarded are not related to the DCS or state budgets, but rather the strength of the applicants competitively bidding for the contracts. We have a plan in place to relocate children affected by this decision to make necessary placement transitions as smooth as possible.\n\nWe are extending existing contracts past the June 1 deadline in order to not disrupt any child’s school year. Our contract decisions are based on the Department’s projected capacity needs, and we are anticipating a further reduction in the number of children in congregate care this year.\n\nEven though we expect a decrease in congregate care homes, we would like to remind the public that we are always in need of foster parents, and we are constantly recruiting. We especially need homes for sibling groups and teenagers. We encourage anyone who is interested in becoming a licensed foster parent to visit dcs.az.gov/foster for more information.\"\n\n-Arizona Department of Child Safety\n\n“Children thrive when they are able to make strong, family connections. These connections are most likely to form when children are placed in homes surrounded by caring adults.\n\nThis is why the Department’s top priority for years has been to place as few children as possible in congregate care facilities in favor of family-like settings such as foster and kinship homes.\n\nChildren who spend an extended amount of time in congregate care settings are more likely to age out of foster care without a permanent family connection, which increases their chances of experiencing adverse outcomes as adults.\n\nWith the goal of placing every child in a family-like setting and connecting them with a caring adult, here are some of the steps we are taking to accomplish that:\n\n-Kinship support services for emotional support and service connection\n\n-Increase kinship licensure for financial support\n\n-Designated staff to locate missing and runaway children\n\n-Partnership to review cases of children in congregate care\n\n-Expand Fostering Sustainable Connections to locate relatives\n\nIn regards to the most recent contract evaluations and violations, we conducted a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Congregate Care Services following the solicitation process outlined in the Arizona State Procurement Code.\n\nIf a provider has a violation, it doesn’t automatically disqualify their proposal.\n\nViolations are one part of a broader formula that we use to determine who is awarded a contract.\n\nDuring the evaluation period, each proposal is evaluated on the following criteria: Cost, Methodology, and Experience/History. For every provider that submits an offer, a question about disciplinary action/administrative action is asked and is considered in the evaluation process. Only Corrective Action Plans (CAP) and Demands for Assurances (DFA) are considered in the process since they are formal contract compliance actions. Providers must disclose these violations with their proposal. You can find the evaluation and supporting documentation in the Arizona Procurement Portal at https://spo.az.gov/contracts.”\n\n-Arizona Department of Child Safety\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

The Arizona attorney general’s office said Wednesday, May 1, that Meadows had been served and confirmed that he was charged with the same counts as the other named defendants, including conspiracy, fraud and forgery charges.\n\nWith the indictments, Arizona becomes the fourth state where allies of the former president have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election.\n\nGiuliani faces other legal proceedings, and a bankruptcy judge this past week said he was “disturbed” about the status of the case and for missed deadlines to file financial disclosure reports. Giuliani filed for bankruptcy after being ordered to pay $148 million to two former election workers for spreading a false conspiracy theory about their role in the 2020 election.\n\nGiuliani was also indicted last year by a grand jury in Georgia, where he is accused of spearheading Trump’s efforts to compel state lawmakers in Georgia to ignore the will of voters and illegally appoint pro-Trump electoral college electors.\n\nAmong the defendants are 11 Arizona Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that Trump won in Arizona in the 2020 presidential election — including a former state GOP chair, a 2022 U.S. Senate candidate and two sitting state lawmakers. The other defendants are Mike Roman, who was Trump’s director of Election Day operations, and four attorneys accused of organizing an attempt to use fake documents to persuade Congress not to certify Biden’s victory: John Eastman, Christina Bobb, Boris Epshteyn and Jenna Ellis.\n\nTrump himself was not charged but was referred to as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nThe 11 people nominated to be Arizona’s Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were “duly elected and qualified” electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. The Arizona Republican Party posted a one-minute video of the signing ceremony on social media at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes.\n\nEastman, who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election, became the first person charged in Arizona’s fake elector case to be arraigned on Friday. He pleaded not guilty to conspiracy, fraud and forgery charges.\n\nEastman made a brief statement outside the courthouse, saying the charges against him should have never been filed.\n\n“I had zero communications with the electors in Arizona (and) zero involvement in any of the election litigation in Arizona or legislative hearings. And I am confident that with the laws faithfully applied, I will be fully be exonerated at the end of this process,” Eastman said. He declined to make further comment.\n\nArraignments are scheduled May 21 for 12 other people charged in the case, including nine of the 11 Republicans who had submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring Trump had won Arizona.\n\nThe indictment names the following individuals as defendants: Rudolph Giuliani, Mark Meadows, John Eastman, Boris Epshteyn, Christina Bobb, Jenna Ellis, Michael Roman, Kelli Ward, Tyler Bowyer, Nancy Cottle, Jacob Hoffman, Anthony Kern, James Lamon, Robert Montgomery, Samuel Moorhead, Lorraine Pellegrino, Gregory Safsten, and Michael Ward.\n\nThe Arizona indictment said Eastman encouraged the GOP electors to cast their votes in December 2020, unsuccessfully pressured state lawmakers to change the election’s outcome in Arizona and told then-Vice President Mike Pence that he could reject Democratic electors in the counting of electoral votes in Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

All of those astronauts who have been to the moon trained in Flagstaff.\n\nNow, the next generation of space cadets is back in the high country, preparing for another trip.\n\n“We’re using Flagstaff as this tipping point to get back to the moon,” Planetary Geologist Trevor Graff said.\n\nThe rocky, otherworldly landscape of Flagstaff’s volcanic field brought NASA’s Apollo team to Arizona in the ‘70s. Now NASA is back again; this time, the Artemis team is using the moonlike surface to train.\n\n“We bring astronauts from their very basic training geology all the way to crew members that are going to go to the moon back here to flagstaff just like Apollo did,” Graff said. “They set the precedent so now we’re standing on the shoulders of giants.”\n\nTest Manager Dave Coan said the training astronauts use training suits and the volcanic field here to simulate full moon walks.\n\n“They talk to Mission Control the whole time, and within Mission Control, the science team is there exercising all those components together is not something we can do very easily anywhere else,” Coan said. “So here’s where we can get that done, so that’s what we’ve been doing.\n\nThis trip to Arizona showcases not only the astronauts’ training but also all the technology used to create a real lunar experience.\n\nAstronauts Kate Rubins and Andre Douglas sported the suits this week. They’ll become the first woman and person of color to walk on the moon.\n\n“To be here in Flagstaff where all that training took place and initially,” Rubins said. “To be doing it and realizing that 50 years in the future you know our children and our grandchildren are going to be looking at these black and white photos and and that’s going to be the team that got Artemis to the moon.”\n\nThey said that as they make history, they also want the next generation to shoot for the stars and beyond.\n\n“You do what you love that’s the core of it and do well in it you share your goals with people and they’ll help you get there,” Douglas said.\n\nThere is no set date yet for when the team will blast off to the moon, but they will be back here in Flagstaff to train again in the near future.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

Hobbs said in an emailed statement. “While members of our legislature tell Arizona women to put aspirin between their knees instead of taking action to pass the Arizona Right to Contraception Act, I will continue to do everything in my power to protect our reproductive freedom and ensure every Arizonan can access contraception.”\n\nIn a news release, the governor noted that the order makes over-the-counter birth control available to state employees at no cost and expands coverage to those under other health insurance plans in the state. Additionally, it requires AHCCCS, the state’s Medicaid provider, to consider ways it can expand access to contraception for its members.\n\nLast week, the Arizona Supreme Court granted state attorney general Kris Mayes’ request to delay the enforcement of the 1864 near-total abortion ban that lawmakers recently voted to repeal.\n\nThe ruling said the earliest the Civil War-era law could be enforced would be Aug. 12, but the Attorney General’s Office said another 45 days were added to that because of the separate Issacson v.

Immersive experiences are now just commonplace. For many, though, it can be pricey and just a little out of reach. But Act One, a cultural experience nonprofit, wants to close the gaps in access to some of our state’s most underserved students.\n\nThe students in Mr. Abbotts’ photography class may be sitting in their North High School classroom, but they’re about to go on a trip.\n\n“Please put your headsets on we’re going to calibrate them and have them all look the same direction and then we’re going to start the chapter,” said Act One Field Trip Manager Emanuel Class.\n\n“They’re being transported to the Four Corners area right now,” said Aaron Abbott. He’s also a teacher ambassador for Act One. The Valley nonprofit strives to provide arts and cultural experiences for Arizona families, particularly those at or below the federal poverty level.\n\n“We actually travel the entire state we have two vans, and we come to students anywhere, Title One schools for free and we bring the arts for them,” said Executive Director Beth Maloney.\n\nThis arts immersion experience is called “Weaving Our Story.” Local indigenous artists share their stories from their perspectives on hoop dancing, sheepherding, art and storytelling.\n\n“I personally like it because I’m native so being able to see my culture represented in the classroom is just a very nice experience and I like it being shared with my fellow classmates and friends. It just makes me very happy,” said one student.\n\nAct One says this was born out of the pandemic when schools and art institutions were shut down. Now the technology has grown, gotten better and this is here to stay.\n\n“Oh it’s super cool and it’s not always possible to get them to art museums or artists they might be studying and this gives them that opportunity,” said Abbott.\n\nIt’s Act One’s second season of content. Their first season highlighted Mexican art and history. Over 18,000 students have participated in these VR field trips so far.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

Unfortunately, Arizona has one of the highest rates of domestic violence in the country.\n\nAccording to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence in Arizona, 42.6% of women and 33.4% of men in the state experience some form of domestic violence or stalking from their intimate partner.\n\nThe Maricopa County Attorney’s Office says that 20 people per minute are physically abused by their intimate partner in the U.S., which is around 10 million victims per year. The disturbing statistics also show that one in three women and one in 20 men are killed by their intimate partner.\n\nJust this week, the Valley has seen several tragic domestic violence cases.\n\nOn Friday, a woman was held hostage by her baby’s father in a home in Surprise. She escaped with minor injuries, but her baby was shot multiple times and is in the hospital. The house was then engulfed in flames, and police don’t know the suspect’s current condition.\n\nEarlier this week, 28-year-old Brooke Lundy was killed by her boyfriend, Matthew Blevins, before he shot himself in Gilbert. Lundy’s family says her boyfriend was controlling and abusive. He reportedly put cameras in the home and threatened to kill her and her family if she left.\n\nDomestic violence can be hard to identify as it can take many forms of physical, emotional and financial abuse, and all cases and situations are different.\n\nThere are organizations available to help anyone going through a domestic violence situation in Arizona.\n\nSee the list below for information on the domestic violence programs and shelters available in Maricopa County.\n\nValleywide:\n\nMaricopa County Domestic Violence Hotline: 480-890-3039 or 1-844-723-3387 (SAFEDVS).\nA New Leaf: 480-969-4024\n\nPhoenix:\n\nChrysalis: 602-944-4999\nCPLC De Colores: 602-269-1515\nSojourner Center: 602-244-0089\n\nWest Valley:\n\nGoodyear: New Life Center, 623-932-4404\nPeoria: Eve’s Place, 623-537-5380\n\nEast Valley:\n\nScottsdale: Scottsdale Family Advocacy Center, 480-312-6300\nChandler: Catholic Charities My Sister’s Place, 480-821-1024\nApache Junction: Community Alliance Against Family Abuse, 480-982-0196\n\nThe National Domestic Violence Hotline is also available 24-7 for anyone who needs help at 1-800-799-7233 (SAFE).\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

The pool is a popular option to escape the heat. However, the City of Phoenix is still having issues opening all of its pools.\n\nLast summer, they didn’t have enough lifeguards. This year, it’s a slightly different problem.\n\n“We’re doing very well with the lifeguard situation this year, able to hire enough to fill our positions and now we’re ready to open pools,” said Becky Kirk, the Aquatic Supervisor for the City of Phoenix Parks and Recreation Department.\n\nThe City of Phoenix is opening 18 of its 29 pools for families to splash around in this summer.\n\n“This year, we’re offering $3,000 for pool managers and $2,000 for assistant managers and lifeguards,” said Kirk.\n\nThose bonuses, plus pay bumps, have mostly paid off. Kirk said there are more lifeguards this year. However, the city is still falling short in other areas and won’t be able to open up all its pools.\n\n“It’s largely due to management coverage and having enough pool managers to operate the pools to have the supervision for the lifeguards,” said Kirk.\n\nOther cities like Glendale, Scottsdale and Chandler said they are good to go.\n\n“We’ve been fortunate the last two years to not have the problem. We made an aggressive move last year to increase our pay for lifeguards, so we offer $25 an hour rate for lifeguards,” said Manny Padia, the Recreation Administrator for the City of Glendale Parks and Recreation Dept.\n\nAs the cities prepare for families to take a dip in their pools, they also want safety to be top of mind wherever people go swimming.\n\n“Make sure, if you have a backyard pool, you have barriers in place, so you have the fence and latches in the door to protect kids wandering,” said Kirk.\n\nAccording to the Children’s Safety Zone, 19 people have died from water-related incidents in Maricopa and Pinal Counties so far this year.\n\nKirk encourages families to sign up for swimming lessons. “We teach kids as early as six months old all the way through adults,” said Kirk.\n\nThe City of Phoenix is offering two-week swimming lessons for $15.\n\nClick here to see which pools will be open for the summer.

Slack demand at the pump and stable oil prices have kept any increases in check.\n\nThe lower prices ahead of the Memorial Day weekend are typical. ”There are seven states with county gas averages at less than $3 a gallon,” AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross said in a statement Thursday. “This trend will likely accelerate as more gas outlets east of the Rockies drop their prices.”\n\nThe Energy Information Administration released its forecast for summer gas prices and anticipates a $3.70 national average over the course of the season, implying prices slightly higher than today’s average.\n\nOther measures affecting gas prices are also working in Americans’ favor. Refinery utilization is a measure that, when low, can push prices for customers upward. Today that figure sits relatively high heading into the summer months.\n\nExtreme weather or routine maintenance could take these offline and pull that number down.

Police say the woman and baby lived at the home, but Marchetti, the father of the child, did not.\n\nSomehow, she escaped around 11:30 a.m. and went to a construction crew nearby and told them what happened, Hernandez said. They called 911.\n\nMarchetti and the baby were still inside the home when the police arrived.\n\nWhile at the scene, officers heard gunshots. One Surprise Police officer responded by firing a gun toward the house where Marchetti was.\n\nOther officers forced their way into the home and found the baby shot multiple times, Hernandez said.\n\nSurprise police say 51-year-old Todd Christopher Marchetti was involved in Friday’s hostage situation.(Surprise Police Department)\n\nPolice said they didn’t see or talk to Marchetti but rescued the child from inside the house.\n\nThe baby boy was flown to a nearby hospital in serious condition, but police said the victim should survive. He underwent surgery for injuries to his lower body on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe woman was treated on scene for only minor injuries and then was taken to the hospital to be with her child, Hernandez said.\n\n“When a call came in to 911 our officers were ready to put themselves in that line of fire that in the danger for the betterment of that young child. Right now, that child is clinging to life, that child is in surgery, that child to has an opportunity to recover and that is what our officers are focused on right now is that we provided that child the opportunity to recover,” said Hernandez.\n\nArizona’s Family news chopper arrived over the scene and spotted armored SWAT trucks at a home. The home’s garage and windows were destroyed as armed police surrounded the home.\n\nPolice say Marchetti refused to come out of the home and peacefully surrender to police.\n\nAround 3 p.m., the house caught fire with Marchetti still inside. Video from the scene showed how the fire erupted and tore through the home.\n\n“Next thing you know, there was smoke. And after the smoke, there’s a huge ball of fire coming from the back of the house and it just spread from the back all the way to the front,” said Hector Holguin, Arizona’s Family drone operator, who was on the scene when the fire started. “It just progressed. It collapsed the roof.”\n\nBecause Marchetti might still have been in the home, firefighters couldn’t get too close to the flames, which delayed their response. They also heard gunfire coming from inside the house, Hernandez said.\n\n“Firefighters don’t wear bulletproof vests. Firefighters don’t have weapons so they are vulnerable on these kinds of situations so it’s imperative that law enforcement stabilize that scene in such a way that it’s safe to address the fire,” said Andy Anderson, a former assistant Phoenix Police chief.\n\nFirefighters used two ladder trucks to spray the house with water and water down the house next door to keep the flames from spreading.\n\nBy 4:30 p.m., the fire appeared to have been put out, but firefighters were still mopping up hot spots. The cause of the fire is under investigation, Hernandez said.\n\nNeighbors in the new-build community say they are shocked and horrified by what happened. Multiple neighbors who spoke with Arizona’s Family off camera say they’ve passed that house several times and have never noticed anything out of the ordinary.\n\nDeidre Baumann was in town visiting a friend who live directly across the street and was stuck in the home all day and night while everything played out.\n\n“We were standing to the side of the windows or down to the floor because easily a bullet could have traveled through the window watching much of what occurred. The worst part of it was we knew that there was a mother and baby who lived across the street. According to my friend, mother always had baby on her hip,” said Baumann. “It’s very difficult to understand how something like this can happen. How a father can shoot at a six-month year-old baby. That is beyond evil and it’s hard to process to think what the mother must be going through now.”\n\nNeighbors who are affected are asked to call the Surprise Police Department’s non-emergency number at 623-222-4000.\n\nA GoFundMe has been made to help the mother and baby as they recover during this time.

I don’t have any other explanation besides he’s evil,” said Ogle.\n\nOgle calls it a scene out of a horror movie. Allie and Jaxson are living an unimaginable nightmare after police say 51-year-old Todd Marchetti caused a series of tragic events.\n\n“There’s a lot of fear. She was really afraid of him,” said Ogle.\n\nMarchetti is Jaxson’s father and Allie’s boyfriend of a year and a half. Detectives say Marchetti broke into a home in Surprise around 3 a.m. Friday and held Allie and Jaxson hostage.\n\nAllie and her infant son are living an unimaginable nightmare after police say 51-year-old Todd Marchetti caused a series of tragic events.(Courtesy of Allie, Surprise Police Department, Arizona's Family)\n\nOgle says Allie recently moved in there with her parents to try to get away from Marchetti’s abuse, but he was stalking her.\n\n“He used an ax to get through one of the windows,” said Ogle. “He brought duct tape and ropes and different forms of pliers and a couple different butcher knives.”\n\nThe plan was to torture Allie for days while her parents were away for the weekend, according to Ogle, and in the process, she says Marchetti shot the family dog. She says they all went to the vet, but Allie couldn’t escape then.\n\nOgle says Allie convinced him to let her talk to a construction worker after they got back to ask for help fixing the window he broke. That crew called 911, and then police say Marchetti shot his son.\n\n“She saved both of their lives and I’ve told her that multiple times. She said ‘Oh, well I should have just taken Jaxson out of the house with me’ and I said if you would have picked that baby up and tried to walk out of that door with him he would have opened fire on both of you and neither of you would be here right now,” said Ogle.\n\nOgle says it’s a miracle Jaxson is alive. She says he’s had two surgeries so far, and doctors expect him to pull through.\n\n“He heard Allie’s voice yesterday and opened his eyes. He wiggles his toes. He grabs my finger,” said Ogle. She’s been by their side in the hospital ever since this happened.\n\nPolice say after Jaxson was rescued by tactical teams and taken to the hospital, Marchetti refused to come out, and there was a standoff for hours.\n\nThen, a fire started and destroyed the home. Ogle says Allie’s childhood home burned down, too. “He wanted to make her relive her trauma and that’s exactly what he did,” she said.\n\nOn Saturday, investigators say they found Marchetti’s remains in the rubble. They believe he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\n“There’s a huge part of her that wishes they could have had the family that she wanted to have,” said Ogle.\n\nA GoFundMe has been set up to help them rebuild their lives and recover during this time.

(CNN, SIKHSTORMS, X, KTRK, KHOU, KPRC, MARY ELLEN ANGEL, @WESWAITKUS14, X, SikhStorms / X, @weswaitkus14/X)\n\nIn addition to the heat, the Houston area could face poor air quality during the weekend.\n\nHeavy rainfall was possible in eastern Louisiana and central Alabama on Saturday, and parts of Louisiana were also at risk for flooding.\n\nThe Houston Health Department said it would distribute 400 free portable air conditioners to area seniors, people with disabilities and caregivers of disabled children to contend with the heat.\n\nFive cooling centers also were opened — four in Houston and one in Kingwood.\n\nHUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS REMAIN WITHOUT POWER\n\nThe widespread destruction of Thursday’s storms brought much of Houston to a standstill. Thunderstorms and hurricane-force winds tore through the city — decimating the facade of one brick building and leaving trees, debris and shattered glass on the streets. A tornado also touched down near the northwest Houston suburb of Cypress.\n\nMore than a half-million homes and businesses in Texas remained without electricity by midday Saturday, according to PowerOutage.us. Another 21,000 customers were also without power in Louisiana, where strong winds and a suspected tornado hit.\n\n“It’s been a madhouse out here,” Cypress resident Hallie O’Bannon said. “You know we don’t have any power. No hot water. It’s been really crazy.”\n\n“Everyone is pretty resilient, and everyone’s just trying to get back to normal and help each other out and the best way we can,” O’Bannon added.\n\nA man uses a chainsaw to cut up a tree that tore off the facade of a house, Friday, May 17, 2024, in Houston, after a strong thunderstorm moved through Thursday evening. (Karen Warren/Houston Chronicle via AP)(AP)\n\nCenterPoint Energy, which has deployed 1,000 employees to the area and is requesting 5,000 more, said power restoration could take several days or longer in some areas, and that customers need to ensure their homes can safely be reconnected.\n\n“In addition to damaging CenterPoint Energy’s electric infrastructure and equipment, severe weather may have caused damage to customer-owned equipment” such as the weatherhead, which is where power enters the home, the company said.\n\nCustomers must have repairs completed by a qualified electrician before service can be restored, CenterPoint added.\n\nHigh-voltage transmission towers that were torn apart and downed power lines pose a twofold challenge for utility companies because the damage affected transmission and distribution systems, according to Alexandria von Meier, a power and energy expert who called that a rare thing. Damage to just the distribution system is more typical, von Meier said.\n\nHow quickly repairs are made will depend on a variety of factors, including the time it takes to assess the damage, equipment replacement, roadwork access issues and workforce availability.\n\nSevere thunderstorms have hit southeastern Texas for the second time this month. (MARTISE COLEMAN)\nSTORM CAUGHT MANY OFF GUARD\n\nHarris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez reported late Friday that three people died during the storm, including an 85-year-old woman whose home caught fire after being struck by lightning and a 60-year-old man who had tried to use his vehicle to power his oxygen tank.\n\nHouston Mayor John Whitmire previously said at least four other people were killed in the city when the storms swept through Harris County, which includes Houston.\n\nSchool districts in the Houston area canceled classes Friday for more than 400,000 students and government offices were closed.\n\nHouston Independent School District Superintendent Mike Miles said Saturday that he hoped to reopen schools on Monday, but that is dependent upon the restoration of electricity in school buildings.\n\n“If a school doesn’t have power, it will remain closed,” Miles told reporters during a tour of the heavily damaged Sinclair Elementary School.\n\nWhitmire warned that police were out in force, including state troopers sent to the area to prevent looting. He said the speed and intensity of the storm caught many off guard.\n\nNoelle Delgado, executive director of Houston Pets Alive, said she pulled up at the animal rescue on Thursday night and found the dogs and cats — more than 30 in all — uninjured, but the building’s awning had been ripped off, the sign was mangled and water was leaking inside.\n\nShe hoped to find foster homes for the animals.\n\n“I could definitely tell that this storm was a little different,” she said. “It felt terrifying.”\n\nSTATE AND FEDERAL RECOVERY ASSISTANCE ON THE WAY\n\nIn light of the storm damage, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo and Whitmire both signed disaster declarations, paving the way for state and federal storm recovery assistance.\n\nA separate disaster declaration from President Joe Biden makes federal funding available to people in seven Texas counties — including Harris — that have been affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes and flooding since April 26.\n\n___\n\nMiller reported from Oklahoma City; Associated Press reporters Jamie Stengle in Dallas, Valerie Gonzalez in McAllen, Texas, and Lisa Baumann in Bellingham, Washington, contributed.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Way.com is not cruel and will gently let you know the truth.\n\nOkay, the bad news first. The price of everything from groceries to furniture is going up. The worst news? Insuring your car to navigate this economic apocalypse just got significantly more expensive.\n\nFull Coverage or Empty Wallet? 2024 Auto Insurance Increases Will Hit You Hard!\n\nFull coverage costs $212 a month on average, while liability-only coverage costs $103 a month. That prices out to $2541 and $1238 a year, respectively. In 2023, the average price of full-coverage car insurance across the country went up by 24%.\n\nThe cost of car insurance depends on many things. These include the type of vehicle you drive, your driving record, and, in many places, your credit score.\n\nThe place where you live also has a big impact on your rate, especially in states like Michigan, Connecticut, and Florida. But rates for all types of car insurance are going up at an alarming rate. This is mostly because of things like the cost of auto parts and the effects of climate change.\n\nAuto Insurance Premiums Have Been on a Joyride to Hell\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, auto insurance premiums in 2024 have increased by a whopping 20.6% year-over-year. That’s right, your car insurance is now more expensive than that regrettable avocado toast you splurged on last week.\n\nThis was the biggest increase since December 1976, when rates went up 22.4% from the previous year.\n\nAccording to the BLS, the cost of car insurance went up 17.4% each year in 2023. This was the biggest annual increase since 1976, when it went up 28.7%.\n\nA rise in accidents, type of accidents, and location – factors all working together to make costs go up – are combining to give many American drivers insurance sticker shock.\n\nA lot of people stayed home during the height of the pandemic, but the number of deaths on the roads rose by 10.5% in 2021, reaching their highest level since 2005. The NHTSA said it was the biggest rise in deaths it had ever seen. The number of deaths didn’t go down much from 2021 to 2022.\n\nWay.com\n\nTop 10 States Where Rates are the Highest\n\nFrom population density to car thefts, take a look at the reasons why rates are the highest in these states.\n\nHow Long Will These Rates Stick Around?\n\nIf you are living in one of the states above, you can compare and see how much auto insurance premiums increased in 2023.\n\nCalmer Seas Ahead: Auto Insurance Rates Stabilizing\n\nAfter a turbulent year, auto insurance premiums are now stabilizing, with less substantial increases anticipated in the coming months.\n\nInsurers endured high loss ratios for the majority of 2023, which will likely be reflected in additional rate hikes. This is primarily attributable to the soaring cost of auto parts and the growing volume and severity of claims.\n\nThe insurance industry persisted under the strain of inflationary pressures, labor shortages, and supply chain deceleration, which originated during the COVID-19 pandemic into 2023. However, losses for personal auto insurers have decelerated as the impact of rate increases begins to outweigh loss trends. As a result, drivers may anticipate a degree of industry stabilization in the latter part of 2024.\n\nIncreasing Maintenance and Repair Costs = Lower Insurer Profits\n\nSince 2022, the consumer price index for car maintenance and repair from the Bureau of Labor Statistics has experienced significant double-digit increases. Higher expenses incurred at the auto shop are transferred to insurers, who then adjust their rates to accommodate the rising costs of claims.\n\nInsurers are also bearing the costs of increasingly frequent and severe accidents. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there was a significant increase in traffic fatalities during the COVID-19 shutdowns. In 2020, the number of fatalities rose by 7.3%, and in 2021, it increased by 10.1%.\n\nWith the rise of advanced automotive technology, the cost and complexity of car repairs have also increased. The cost of replacing a windshield can be quite high, especially in vehicles equipped with advanced features like rain-sensing wipers, driver assistance systems, and adaptive cruise control. The cost of replacing a windshield on older vehicles typically ranges from $300 to $600.\n\nElectric vehicles (EVs) do have higher repair costs. In certain models, Tesla has ingeniously integrated batteries as a structural component of their cars rather than a mere replaceable part. This strategic move has allowed Tesla, the leading manufacturer of electric vehicles in the U.S., to solidify its position in the market. If a minor accident occurs, it may be necessary to replace the entire battery, which can result in a significant expense ranging from $5,000 to $20,000 for the replacement part.\n\nTesla: Crash Proof Cars or Crash Test Dummy Insurance?\n\nIn a January 2023 investor call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled his intentions to revamp the design and reduce the expenses associated with repairing a Tesla after a collision. In 2019, the company also introduced Tesla Insurance, providing customers with the opportunity to secure more affordable rates compared to conventional insurance providers.\n\nNevertheless, numerous Tesla Insurance policyholders have expressed frustration over extended wait times for compensation. The automaker is also dealing with class-action lawsuits that claim Tesla sensors generate inaccurate collision warnings, leading to higher insurance premiums.\n\nPandemic Souvenir – Expensive Cars That Nobody Can Afford\n\nThe auto manufacturing industry is facing significant challenges due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, there is a decline in inventory and a noticeable increase in prices for new vehicles. According to Kelley Blue Book, the average transaction price for new cars has increased by about 23% since November 2020, now reaching over $48,000.\n\nOn the other hand, the prices of new vehicles have remained steady from one year to the next, thanks to the favorable market conditions for car buyers. Used vehicle prices also experienced a significant increase but have since decreased by 3% since October 2023, with an average list price of $26,533, according to KBB data. However, the inventory of used vehicles, particularly the ones that are most affordable, continues to be limited.\n\nFire, Flood, Fury – Climate Change Makes Insurance Companies Weep\n\nWeather events are increasingly impacting insurer losses. During the first half of 2023, the U.S. experienced significant losses due to severe convective storms, resulting in insured damages amounting to a minimum of $29 billion].\n\nIn 2023, there were insurance industry crises in several states that are particularly vulnerable to climate catastrophes, such as Florida, California, and Louisiana. In 2023, the United States witnessed a total of 25 weather or climate disaster events that resulted in losses surpassing $1 billion each, as per the latest data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as of Dec. 8.\n\nDue to the expensive claims related to climate change, major insurers are reducing coverage, not renewing policies, and stopping the sale of new homes and auto policies in high-risk areas. With the rise in the frequency of severe weather events, policyholders may experience a decrease in coverage options, potentially leading to higher rates.\n\nA Roadmap (Maybe)\n\nA significant majority of drivers experienced multiple premium increases in 2023, resulting in a substantial rise in the average annual rate for full coverage to $2,019. Several factors came together to cause a significant increase in rates, such as escalating repair costs, shortages in labor, higher prices for vehicles, and climate disasters.\n\nIn the future, car insurance pricing may be influenced by severe weather events and the expensive repairs associated with high-tech and electric vehicles.\n\nIt is projected that car insurance rates will experience a further increase in 2024. If you’re looking to reduce your car insurance expenses in 2024, there are several choices available. These include raising your deductibles, lowering your coverage limits, and obtaining quotes from multiple insurers to secure a more favorable rate.\n\nPolicyholders may inquire with their insurance companies to see if they are eligible for any potential discounts. Typical discounts encompass savings for vehicle safety features, defensive driving courses, combining home and auto insurance, and establishing automatic payments.\n\nBottom line\n\nAs a result of record losses incurred by insurers due to the escalating cost of repairs, climate calamities, and severe car accidents, auto insurance premiums increased by an alarming 24% in 2023.\nRecent estimates indicate that auto insurance premiums will increase by 7% in 2024, which is nearly double the median annual increase.\nAnnually, a full-coverage policy costs an average of $2,019 at the national level, which is equivalent to 2.6% of the median household income. The national average cost of state-mandated liability insurance increased to $1,154.\nIn 2023, average wage growth was 638% lower than the increase in auto insurance premiums.\nIncreasing deductibles and decreasing coverage limits are the most common cost-cutting measures among motorists. 45%, however, stated that they had not implemented any measures to decrease their premiums.\nThe average annual premium for a full-coverage policy for New York motorists is $3,374, the highest in the nation.\n\nThis story was produced by Way.com and reviewed and distributed by Stacker Media.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

As officers arrived, 33-year-old Jamarr Young was “immediately aggressive toward officers” and began telling officers to shoot and kill him, police say.\n\nYoung reportedly refused to listen to the officers’ commands as they used less-lethal tools to get him to comply. However, he then got into his car, drove it toward the officers and hit a police SUV before speeding off.\n\nAs Young was heading northbound on 16th Street, police say he struck a bicyclist that was crossing the road. However, he didn’t stop and continued to speed away. Emergency crews attempted to save the bicyclist, but he died at the scene.\n\nCourt documents say at the time Young hit the bicyclist, he was speeding at 58 miles per hour in a 40 zone. While driving, Young also had a BAC of 0.138, nearly double the legal limit.\n\nHe was booked on 11 charges, including murder, leaving the scene of an accident with injuries, aggravated DUI and multiple counts of aggravated assault on a police officer.(Maricopa County Sheriff's Office)\n\nOfficers tracked Young’s vehicle and attempted to pull him over, but he refused, leading to a pursuit between him and officers. Authorities say police were forced to call off the pursuit when Young’s driving became “too erratic.”\n\nHe continued to speed off before crashing into a construction fence area in Tempe, near the I-10 and US 60 interchange.\n\nAfter crashing his car, Young attempted to run away from the police and tried to climb a chainlink fence but was eventually caught. Court documents say a struggle ensued between Young and officers as he put one officer in a headlock while another tackled him.

Authorities say the victim and Young were in a previous relationship.\n\nYoung was booked on 11 charges, including murder, leaving the scene of an accident with injuries, aggravated DUI and multiple counts of aggravated assault on a police officer.

She says they’ve been tracking the doses they’ve given out to people since 2017.\n\n“We are continuing to get naloxone into people’s hands,” Coles said. “We have received reports of nearly 30,000 lives saved as a result of the naloxone we have given out. It’s enormous. It’s 30,000 people, 30,000 families 30,000 communities that have not been destroyed by the preventable loss of somebody.”\n\nThe need for the life-saving vial of naloxone has grown over the years.\n\nSPW says this milestone is bittersweet. Coles says while the drug they give out saves people, the need for it shows a prevention failure.\n\n“We’d love to live in a world where naloxone isn’t needed and people aren’t experiencing overdoses in the first place.”\n\nColes admits we may never live in a drug-free world, but we can do better. She believes better policy and education can make a big difference.\n\nShe says Arizona’s overdosing fatality numbers haven’t increased since 2021 like other states, but there are still better ways to prevent someone from stopping breathing because of an overdose.\n\n“It’s going to take everybody. It’s going to take prevention, treatment, recovery, public health everyone to make an impact because it’s not just one solution.”\n\nSPW has events where they give out kits of naloxone. They also will mail it to people free of charge.\n\nColes says the best people to give it to are people who are at risk of an overdose and then family, friends or people who live with that person.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more and getting naloxone for yourself, click here.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

Houston Mayor John Whitmire said four people, and possibly five, had died.\n\n“It was fierce. It was intense. It was quick, and most Houstonians didn’t have time to place themselves out of harms way,” Whitmire said at a news conference.\n\nWith multiple transmission towers down, Hidalgo urged patience. Thousands of utility workers were headed to the area, where power had already been restored to roughly 200,000 customers. Another 100,000 customers were without power in Louisiana, down from a peak of 215,000.\n\nSevere thunderstorms have hit southeastern Texas for the second time this month. (MARTISE COLEMAN)\n\n“We are going to have to talk about this disaster in weeks, not days,” Hidalgo said.\n\nShe said she had heard “horror stories of just terror and powerlessness” as the storm came through. The weather service also reported straight-line winds of up to 100 mph (161 kph) in downtown Houston and the suburbs of Baytown and Galena Park.\n\nNoelle Delgado’s heart sank as she pulled up Thursday night to Houston Pets Alive, the animal rescue organization where she is executive director. The dogs and cats — more than 30 in all — were uninjured, but the awning had been ripped off, the sign was mangled and water was leaking inside. With power expected to be out for some time and temperatures forecast to climb into the 90s Saturday, she hoped to find foster homes for the animals.\n\n“I could definitely tell that this storm was a little different,” she said. “It felt terrifying.”\n\nYesenia Guzmán, 52, worried whether she would get paid with the power still out at the restaurant where she works in the Houston suburb of Katy.\n\n“We don’t really know what’s going to happen,” she said.\n\nThe widespread destruction brought much of Houston to a standstill. Trees, debris and shattered glass littered the streets. One building’s wall was ripped off.\n\nSchool districts in the Houston area canceled classes for more than 400,000 students and government offices were closed. City officials urged people avoid downtown and stay off roads, many of which were flooded or lined with downed power lines and malfunctioning traffic lights.\n\nWhitmire said at least 2,500 traffic lights were out. He also warned would-be looters that “police are out in force, including 50 state troopers sent to the area to prevent looting.”\n\nAt least two of the deaths were caused by falling trees and another happened when a crane blew over in strong winds, officials said.\n\nWhitmire’s office posted a photo Friday on the social platform X showing the mayor signing a disaster declaration, which paves the way for state and federal storm recovery assistance.\n\nPresident Joe Biden later issued a disaster declaration for seven counties in Texas, including Harris, due to severe weather since April 26. His action makes federal funding available to people affected by the storms.\n\nThe problems from Thursday’s storms extended to the Houston suburbs, with emergency officials in neighboring Montgomery County describing the damage to transmission lines as “catastrophic.”\n\nHigh-voltage transmission towers that were torn apart and downed power lines pose a twofold challenge for the utility company because the damage affected transmission and distribution systems, according to Alexandria von Meier, a power and energy expert who called that a rare thing.\n\n“It’s more typical that the damage is just at the distribution system, which is, you know, just not as strong,” von Meier said, referring to power lines that tend to be more susceptible to wind damage.\n\nHow quickly repairs are made will depend on a variety of factors, including the time it takes to assess the damage, equipment replacement, roadwork access issues and workforce availability. Centerpoint Energy deployed 1,000 employees on Friday and had a pending request for 5,000 more line workers and vegetation professionals.\n\nOne silver lining, von Meier said, is that the damage was localized, unlike what happened in the 2021 statewide freeze, which could allow for other jurisdictions to send resources more readily. Although customers might want an aggressive repair timeline, she cautioned that it must proceed carefully and methodically.\n\n“Because if you try to fix this kind of thing in a hurry and you try to restore power in a hurry, you might injure people. You would be putting the workers at risk. You could be putting other people at risk. You could be blowing up equipment that then is going to take longer to replace,” von Meier said.\n\nThe storms also weren’t over Friday. Gulf Coast states could experience scattered, severe thunderstorms with tornadoes, large hail and damaging winds. Heavy to excessive rainfall is possible for eastern Louisiana into central Alabama, the National Weather Service said. Flood watches and warnings remained Friday for Houston and areas to the east.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center’s website showed a report of a tornado in Convent, Louisiana, about 55 miles (89 kilometers) from New Orleans, with multiple reports of trees and power poles down.\n\nA suspected tornado hit the Romeville area of St. James Parish on Thursday night with some homes impacted and trees down, but no injuries or fatalities had been reported, parish officials said in a social media post on Friday morning.\n\nThere were wind gusts of 84 mph (135 kph) at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport and 82 mph (132 kph) at New Orleans Lakefront Airport, according to Tim Erickson, a meteorologist at the weather service’s office for New Orleans and Baton Rouge.\n\nThe office for New Orleans and Baton Rouge issued a flash flood warning through Saturday.\n\nHeavy storms slammed the Houston area during the first week of May, leading to numerous high-water rescues, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes.\n\n___\n\nThe story has been updated to correct that school districts across the Houston area canceled classes Friday, not just the Houston Independent School District, and also the spelling of Cypress.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Jamie Stengle in Dallas and Valerie Gonzalez in McAllen contributed.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Testers also look at the convenience and sturdiness of every grill.\n\nCR also surveys its members on their experience with different grills. Weber grills consistently earn high marks for owner satisfaction and reliability. And the top-performing midsized Weber Genesis Smart Grill EPX-335 35810001 for $1,400 is no exception.\n\nHowever, CR’s tests have also found that you don’t need to spend thousands to get a great-performing grill. While not as sturdy as the Weber, the Monument Grills 25392 for $420 performs just as well for hundreds less.\n\nTo keep your grill running at peak performance, you need to keep it clean. CR tried out different grill brushes to see which ones cleaned up the mess, such as stuck-on chicken skins, salmon skins and melted cheese — foods that typically stick to grill grates.\n\nThe metal Grill Daddy Steam Cleaning Grill Brush, which costs $100, made light work of our messes; however, it’s pricey. The Room Essentials Nylon Grill Cleaning Brush is an alternative, costing $10. A Nylon bristle brush also gets the job done, but you’ll need to replace it more often because Nylon can melt on hot grill grates.\n\nTo keep foods from sticking to the grates, preheat your grill for about 15 minutes before cooking.\n\nCR says to always wipe down your grill grates after using a metal bristle brush because the bristles can break off and end up in your food. A damp cloth will do. Use an oiled cloth if you have a grill with bare cast-iron grates.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

No arraignment date has been scheduled for Giuliani. Arizona authorities say they have been unable to serve Giuliani with the notice of the charges.\n\nFormer Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows is scheduled to be arraigned on June 7.\n\nLast year, Eastman was indicted on racketeering, conspiracy and other charges in a scheme to overturn the 2020 president election in Georgia. He has pleaded not guilty to the Georgia charges. Eastman also is named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the sprawling federal indictment filed in Washington against Trump for working to overturn the results of the 2020 election in the run-up to the violent riot by his supporters at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nArizona is the fourth state where allies of the former president have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election.\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona’s Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were “duly elected and qualified” electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes.\n\nOf the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden’s victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 fake Arizona electors, who had asked a federal judge to de-certify the results and block the state of Arizona from sending results to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, the judge concluded the Republicans had “failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.” Days after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 participated in the certificate signing.\n\nMultiple in-person attempts were made to serve Giuliani with the notice but a doorman at his New York City apartment wouldn’t accept it, said Richie Taylor, a spokesperson for Democratic Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, whose office is prosecuting the case. Taylor said efforts by the attorney general’s office to reach Giuliani by phone also were unsuccessful.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

That’s up 4% compared to last year.\n\nIn addition, AAA expects this will be the most crowded Memorial Day weekend at airports since 2005 with 3.51 million air travelers.\n\nTo prepare for the busy weekend, AAA recommends that you make sure your car is in tip- top shape to avoid any speed bumps.\n\n“This is a great time to get your car service. You want to check your car for tires, make sure there’s enough tread. Make sure your car battery is ready, especially in Arizona car batteries don’t last as long,” Paredes said.\n\nWhether you’re traveling by car or plane, the best thing you can do is plan ahead.\n\n“Planning is really your best friend when it comes Memorial Day. Things can be stressful. There will be a lot of people on the road. Lots of traffic. So, if you do a lot of planning it can really spare you a big headache,” Paredes said.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

Christensen and his mother-in-law Judy Rosenburg are speaking on behalf of the family.\n\n“They all feel helpless,” said Rosenburg.\n\nOn Sunday, just after midnight, officers found Lundy and her boyfriend, 40-year-old Matthew Blevins, dead inside a home near Val Vista Drive and Ray Road. Detectives believe Lundy was shot more than once before Blevins turned the gun on himself.\n\n“She had told her mother on her birthday, May 1, that he was threatening to kill her,” said Rosenburg.\n\nLundy grew up in Grand Island, Nebraska, and her life was full of tragedy. Rosenburg says Lundy’s father died by suicide when she was 12, and her mother wasn’t able to care for her.\n\nSo, Lundy and her brother moved in with their grandparents and Christensen. She lost both of her grandparents by the time she was 14.\n\n“So, Brooke was kind of alone and she left. She had a job offer in Arizona so that is how she came to go to Arizona about three-and-a-half, four years ago,” said Rosenburg.\n\nRosenburg says Lundy was a manager at a gas station, and that’s how she met Blevins.\n\n“From what she told me is he would come in and get gas and he asked her out and he was considerably older than her, but she thought he was a very nice guy at that point,” said Rosenburg.\n\nThe couple moved in together, and she told her family back in Nebraska that she was happy.\n\nRosenburg says they had no idea the relationship was abusive until Lundy revealed the truth just two weeks ago.\n\n“A couple weeks ago he broke her nose and her arm and he threatened to harm her whole family if she came back to Nebraska,” said Rosenburg.\n\nRosenburg says Lundy tried to get away but felt trapped. Her family was working on a plan to get her out of danger.\n\n“I just wish that I could have been down there to get her out of there and help her before this happened,” said Christensen.\n\nThe family set up a GoFundMe to go toward funeral expenses. They want others to know if you or anyone in your life is in a domestic violence situation, help is available.\n\nThe Domestic Violence Hotline 24/7 is also available at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or by texting “START” to 88788..\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

According to the Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office, evidence showed Sandra “vigorously struggled while she was in the grave” and she may have been conscious for up to five minutes.\n\nCellphone evidence showed Pagniano was in the gravesite area days before Sandra went missing and the night of the kidnapping.\n\nDetectives also found notes Sandra supposedly wrote to her husband, stating that she was leaving and giving him her vehicles, house and custody of their kids. However, these notes were actually written by Pagniano, authorities said.\n\nIn addition to the life sentence, Pagniano was given another 16.5 years in prison for kidnapping, forgery and fraud schemes.\n\n“I hope the life sentence brings some closure to the victim’s family. I want to be clear that my office will vigorously prosecute anyone who commits a violent crime in Yavapai County and we will continue to pursue the death penalty in appropriate cases,” McGrane said in a written statement.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

It’s the second leading cause of accidental death for children between five and 14. Data shows that nine out of 10 drowning deaths happen when a caregiver is supervising but not paying attention.\n\nAhead of summer vacation plans, the United States Swim School Association (USSSA) wants families to know how to keep their loved ones safe if their plans include a pool, beach or lake.\n\nUSSSA recommends having enough lifejackets for family and guests, ensuring lifejackets are U.S. Coast Guard approved, avoiding arm floaties, keeping toys away from the pool and having a designated ‘pool watcher’ to watch kids swimming, especially at parties.\n\nAside from the physical additions you can add to your pool, lake or beach activities, Executive Director Liza Zarda says the biggest line of defense from drowning is swim lessons.\n\n“It’s so tragic because when incidents happen. I hear from families, ‘I didn’t know, I didn’t know it can happen to me,’ and a child can slip under in a matter of seconds,” Zarda said. “Swim lessons reduce the risk of drowning by 88%, and many of them do have grant and scholarship programs.”\n\nIf you’re looking for swim lessons near you, Zarda says to check out your city’s parks and recreation programs for classes.\n\nYou can also find certified swim schools near you at this link.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?
