        "content": "NEW YORK — ⁣In the opening of his corruption ‍trial, Democratic U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez was depicted by a federal‍ prosecutor as a politician driven by greed, willing to disrupt local ‌criminal investigations and assist foreign governments in return for bribes, including gold bars.\n\nThe prosecutor, Lara Pomerantz, informed the jury on Wednesday that Menendez, the senior senator⁤ from New Jersey, utilized​ his wife as an intermediary. He attempted to aid Egypt in securing billions‍ in U.S. ‌military assistance and⁤ further the business and‍ legal interests⁣ of two businessmen from ⁣his state involved in local criminal ⁤cases.\n\n“Robert Menendez, for years, has been​ betraying the people he was elected to serve by accepting bribes,” ⁢ Pomerantz stated during the ‌prosecution’s⁢ opening statement in​ Manhattan federal court.\n\nShe further added, “This case revolves around a public official who prioritized greed, who placed ⁤his‌ own interests above his duty to the people, who put his power on⁤ the auction ⁢block. This was not your typical politics. This ⁤was ​politics driven by profit.”\n\nProsecutors have labeled Menendez‍ as the key player in a five-year‌ scheme where he accepted ⁤hundreds‍ of thousands of ⁢dollars in bribes in return for political favors​ and assistance to the governments‌ of ‍Egypt and Qatar.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the bribes received by Menendez and his ⁣wife, Nadine Menendez, included cash, gold bars, mortgage payments, and a Mercedes-Benz convertible. The⁤ 70-year-old, three-term senator has pleaded not guilty to⁤ 16 criminal charges including bribery, fraud, acting as a foreign ​agent, and obstruction. Wael Hana‍ and‌ Fred Daibes, the two ⁢New Jersey businessmen being tried alongside him, have also pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe defense lawyers will also ⁣present their ‍opening statements.\n\nNadine Menendez, 57, has also been charged and pleaded not guilty. She is set to face trial on July 8, with the delay resulting from what her lawyers have ⁣described as a serious medical‌ condition.\n\nThe senator’s trial could extend until early July. This is the senator’s second trial on bribery charges,⁤ which cost him the leadership of⁢ the influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Menendez’s previous trial concluded in 2017​ in a mistrial after the jury was unable to reach a verdict.\n\nEarlier‍ in the ⁢day, U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein selected 12 jurors and six alternates, including an investment banker, a commercial litigator, a retired economist, a doctor,⁤ and multiple therapists. They‌ were chosen over 2-1/2 ⁤days of jury selection from a pool of 150 potential jurors.\n\nInterference\n\nPomerantz outlined what prosecutors believe to be a complex⁣ and​ scandalous web ⁢of corruption spanning from 2018 to 2023, with the Menendezes accepting bribes‌ from Hana, Daibes, and an ⁤associate of Hana, insurance broker​ Jose Uribe.\n\nPomerantz stated that in return, the ⁤senator assisted Hana ⁤in securing a profitable⁣ monopoly on certifying that meat exports ⁣to Egypt adhered to Islamic law, and attempted to help Daibes obtain millions of dollars ⁣from a Qatari investment ⁢fund.\n\nMenendez has also been accused of attempting to interfere in a federal criminal case against Daibes in New Jersey, including by recommending ​a candidate⁢ to be the ⁢top federal prosecutor there, and in state criminal cases involving two of Uribe’s associates.\n\nPomerantz said Menendez tried to cover his tracks by​ having ​his wife communicate ⁢about the bribes, but that she kept him informed.\n\nProsecutors have ⁤stated that⁢ FBI agents ‌discovered more than $480,000 of cash in ⁢the Menendezes’ home, much of ⁢it hidden in clothing, closets, and a‍ safe.\n\nThey also ‍stated that Hana and‌ Daibes provided more than $100,000 of gold bars to the Menendezes, while‍ Uribe assisted the couple‌ in purchasing ​the Mercedes. Pomerantz said the money for that purchase was disguised as a loan.\n\nUribe ⁢pleaded guilty​ in March to bribery and fraud and is expected to testify against Menendez.\n\nWhile Nadine ​Menendez is not yet on trial, ⁣her husband’s lawyers have​ suggested ‍his defense might include an attempt to blame‌ her ‍for ⁤withholding information and making him believe his activities were⁤ lawful.\n\nRobert Menendez‌ became a​ senator in 2006. Prior to being indicted, he would have‍ been favored in his Democratic-leaning state to win a fourth full Senate term in November.\n\nHowever, any re-election‌ bid now would be a long shot,⁣ reflecting recent⁤ polls of voters that⁤ show overwhelming disapproval of Menendez’s job performance.\n\nMenendez has suggested that he would try if acquitted to run as an ⁢independent. Only 9% of⁤ voters polled in March by Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill said they would⁣ prefer him to another Democrat or a Republican.\n\nThe senator has resisted calls to resign made from across the political spectrum.",

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO — Prosecutors have recommended a 40-year prison ⁢sentence⁤ for the individual who forcefully entered the residence of former U.S. House Speaker‌ Nancy Pelosi and brutally attacked her husband with a hammer. They argue that his federal offenses equate to an act of terrorism.\n\nIn a ⁣memorandum submitted to the U.S. District Court in San Francisco, the prosecution team stated that David Wayne DePape, the ⁤convicted man, has⁤ shown no signs of‍ regret for his actions. They believe he⁣ deserves no ⁣mercy and should be given ‍the maximum statutory penalties for⁤ each ⁢of the two charges he was found guilty of last year.\n\nThe memorandum read, ⁤”This case​ comes at a time when radicalism has resulted in ⁣assaults on public figures and elected officials. It provides an opportunity ⁢to‍ send⁣ a ⁤strong message to those nurturing violent ‌ideologies and plans.”\n\nThe sentencing is scheduled for May 17.\n\nIn November, a federal⁢ court jury found DePape guilty of attempting to‍ abduct Pelosi, who was then the speaker ⁢of the U.S. House of Representatives, and assaulting‍ her husband, Paul Pelosi, due to her official role as a⁢ Congress ⁢member.\n\nThe prosecution team suggested that DePape should ⁤be given the maximum prison term for each charge — 20 years for attempted kidnapping and 30 years for assault — ⁢with 20 years of the second charge to ‍be served consecutively⁢ to the first, resulting​ in a total ​of 40⁤ years in prison.\n\nAlthough DePape was not found guilty of terrorism, ‌his offenses — committed a ⁢week before the ​2022⁣ congressional midterm elections — fit the federal definition of terrorism as a crime “designed to influence or affect the conduct of government through intimidation or coercion,”​ according to the prosecutors.\n\nThe prosecutors considered this situation as a⁤ factor for sentencing “enhancement.”\n\nDePape forcefully entered Pelosi’s San Francisco residence in the early hours of Oct. 28, 2022, confronted her ‍husband, and struck him on the head with a hammer⁢ before‌ the police, who were alerted, managed to⁢ apprehend the intruder.\n\nAt the time of the incident, the House speaker,​ who is second in the constitutional line of ​succession to the presidency,‌ was in Washington. Paul Pelosi, then 82, ​was ‌admitted to the hospital for ‍several days due to skull fractures and injuries to his hands and right arm.\n\nEvidence presented ​at the trial revealed that DePape, a Canadian citizen who had been residing‌ in the United States illegally for 14 years at‌ the time of⁢ the attack, was influenced by far-right conspiracy theories, particularly those propagated by the extremist QAnon movement.\n\nThe sentencing memorandum referred to DePape’s⁤ own trial testimony, in which he admitted his​ plan was to abduct Nancy Pelosi, interrogate her, and break her ‍kneecaps if she was found​ to be lying.\n\nThe jury also ⁤listened to a recording of an interview DePape gave to a television station in 2023, in ⁢which he expressed regret for not ⁤causing more harm, stating, “I should have come better prepared.”\n\nAlong with⁣ highlighting DePape’s lack of remorse, the prosecutors argued that the severity of the crime and the need to deter ‌others from committing similar acts justified the harshest possible sentence.\n\nDePape is also facing ‍separate state charges related to the Pelosi break-in and attack, including attempted murder, which could result in a sentence of 13 years to life in prison. He⁣ has entered a plea of not guilty.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON, D.C. — A contentious ⁢bill,​ proposing the addition of a citizenship‌ query to the U.S. census and a modification in the allocation of House seats and presidential electors, received approval from the U.S. House on Wednesday.\n\nHowever,​ this doesn’t necessarily guarantee the bill’s ultimate success.\n\nThe ⁣Equal Representation Act, also known as HR7109, was passed with a narrow margin of 206-202, strictly along party lines. The four House ‍members from⁤ Utah — Reps. Blake Moore, John Curtis, Burgess Owens, and​ Celeste Maloy — sided with their Republican peers in voting in favor of the bill. However, with Democrats holding the majority in the U.S. ‍Senate,​ the future of the bill​ remains uncertain.\n\nDespite this, the revival ​of this push highlights the ongoing focus of many⁢ legislators on matters pertaining to immigration and undocumented immigrants. This type of change, as outlined​ in HR7109,⁤ was previously advocated for ‍by former President Donald Trump during his tenure, albeit without success.\n\nThe‍ proposed​ bill would introduce a question in the U.S. Census Bureau’s next headcount, slated for 2030, asking respondents to confirm their U.S. citizenship.

        "content": "NEW ⁤YORK⁣ — In an ‌unprecedented move, the presiding judge in the criminal trial of⁢ former⁤ U.S. President Donald Trump, Justice Juan Merchan, ⁣imposed a $1,000 fine on Trump for the tenth time.‌ This was due to Trump’s repeated‍ violation of a gag⁣ order, which‌ has led to him being held in contempt of court. ⁣Merchan warned that further breaches ​could result in jail ⁤time for ‌the former president.\n\nMerchan expressed⁤ his frustration, stating that the ⁣previous nine fines, each amounting to $1,000, had not deterred ⁢Trump‌ from breaching the⁤ order. ⁣This order prohibits Trump ‌from publicly‌ discussing⁣ jurors‍ and ⁣witnesses involved in the first-ever criminal trial of​ a ⁢former U.S. president.\n\n“I have done everything within my power to avoid imposing a jail ⁢sanction. However, if necessary, I will not hesitate to do‌ so,” Merchan declared ⁢before the jury was brought ⁢in.\n\nThe trial, which is ‍of​ historical significance, is centered around a hush money ‌payment made to adult film actress⁣ Stormy Daniels during ​the ⁣final stages ‍of the 2016 election.⁤ If ‌Trump were to be ⁢imprisoned, it would be an unprecedented development in⁤ this landmark trial.\n\nFollowing Merchan’s ruling, the⁤ jury heard⁣ testimony from a ‌former employee of Trump.⁤ This testimony could potentially strengthen the ⁣prosecution’s argument that Trump ⁢falsified business ⁢records to conceal the⁢ hush money payment.\n\nTrump, however, maintains ⁢his innocence, pleading not guilty ⁣and denying any wrongdoing.\n\nWhile ⁣imposing the fine, Merchan stated that he viewed jail ​time as ​a “last resort” due to the‍ potential⁣ disruption to the trial, ‍the extraordinary security challenges it ⁢would pose, and the complications it could cause‌ for the 2024 presidential election, where Trump, a Republican, aims to reclaim ⁢the White House⁤ from Democratic President‌ Joe Biden.\n\nMerchan, however, emphasized that Trump’s persistent and deliberate violations of the gag⁢ order ​constituted a “direct assault on⁢ the rule of law.”\n\nThe tenth $1,000 fine was ⁤imposed on Monday, following an⁤ April⁤ 22 broadcast interview where Trump ⁣stated: “That jury was picked so fast ⁢— 95% Democrats. The area’s mostly all Democrat.”\n\nMerchan ruled⁤ that other statements made by Trump,⁤ which mentioned witnesses ‌Michael Cohen and David Pecker, did not breach the order.\n\nThe gag order restricts⁤ Trump ⁢from making statements about jurors, witnesses, and families of the‌ judge and prosecutors if ​intended to interfere with the case. Violations⁤ can result in fines of‌ up to ⁢$1,000 or jail time of up to 30 days.\n\nLast⁣ week, Merchan imposed⁣ a $9,000 fine on Trump for nine social media posts that were deemed ‍to have violated the gag ⁣order.\n\nTrump‌ has frequently voiced his dissatisfaction with the gag order, claiming that it hampers his ability to present his case ‍to voters in his bid to ‍return ‍to the​ White ​House.\n\n“My constitutional right to speak has been taken away,” Trump told reporters outside the courtroom before ‍the start‌ of⁤ the 12th ⁤day of trial.\n\nExamination ⁤of Payment Records\n\nOn Monday, ⁣prosecutors presented business records to the jurors, showing payments totaling $420,000⁣ from Trump to ⁤Cohen, his former personal lawyer ‍and fixer.\n\nThese payments were recorded as ‍legal fees, but prosecutors argue that they ⁢were actually intended to reimburse Cohen‍ for a $130,000 payment made ‌to Daniels⁣ to silence her about a sexual encounter she claims to⁤ have‌ had with Trump⁤ in 2006. Trump denies ever⁢ having a sexual relationship with Daniels.\n\nProsecutors ⁢allege that the $420,000 paid by Trump was intended to cover the $130,000 Cohen paid‌ to Daniels, along with $50,000 in other expenses⁤ he had incurred. Trump doubled that total to account for taxes and also included a $60,000 year-end bonus, they claim.\n\nJeffrey McConney, a former controller in Trump’s organization, testified that he⁣ was not aware of any other instance in which the Trump Organization reimbursed ⁤someone ⁣so generously.\n\nHe stated ⁣that he was informed by the company’s top finance official, Allen ⁤Weisselberg, that​ the payments were reimbursements, not legal ⁤fees. He also stated that he never discussed‍ the‍ payments ⁢with Trump.\n\nProsecutors also presented ledger entries to the jurors, showing that⁣ payments⁢ to Cohen were not listed among ⁢the legal ‌expenses the company paid‌ to outside lawyers.\n\nMost of the jurors appeared ‌to scrutinize‍ the email messages displayed on the screens in⁤ front of their seats as ​McConney testified.\n\nProsecutors argue that Trump’s payment to Daniels​ corrupted⁢ the 2016 election by withholding the news from voters,⁢ at a⁣ time when his⁣ treatment of women was a key ⁤issue in his campaign against Democratic candidate Hillary ​Clinton.\n\nThey ‌claim that the altered business records concealed election-law and ‍tax-law violations‌ that elevate the ‌34 counts Trump faces from misdemeanors to felonies punishable by up to four ‍years ​in prison.\n\nIf found guilty, Trump could face up to four years in ⁢prison,‍ although defendants typically face fines and ‍probation.\n\nThe key figures in⁢ the case, including Cohen and ⁢Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie⁢ Clifford, have yet to testify.\n\nWhile the case‌ involves salacious allegations of adultery⁣ and secret payoffs, ⁣it is⁤ generally considered⁣ less significant⁢ than the three other criminal prosecutions Trump faces. It‌ is the only one certain to go to trial before the Nov. 5​ presidential election.\n\nThe ‍other‌ cases ‍accuse him of attempting ⁤to overturn his 2020 presidential defeat ‍and mishandling classified documents after leaving​ office. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all three.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — A wave⁢ of lawsuits has been launched by over two dozen Republican state attorneys general against the Biden administration. The ⁢legal action, initiated on ​Wednesday, seeks to halt‌ the implementation of a new regulation mandating gun dealers to secure licenses and perform background ⁤checks when transacting firearms sales at gun shows and via ​online platforms.\n\nThe lawsuits are a direct challenge to a rule, ⁣finalized just last month, which the U.S. Justice Department asserts​ is designed⁣ to close the so-called “gun show loophole.” This rule stipulates that those vending firearms at gun shows, ‌other ​locations, and through the internet must adhere to the same prerequisites as‍ traditional gun stores in​ conducting ⁣background​ checks on potential purchasers.\n\nThe Biden administration estimates that the rule, which is yet to be⁤ implemented, will impact tens of thousands of gun sales annually.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has urged Congress ​to ‌enact legislation mandating ⁢universal background checks and prohibiting assault-style rifles. However, ⁣Republican legislators have ‌resisted such laws, arguing they infringe upon ⁢the 2nd Amendment rights to ‍bear arms as enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAnnouncing the lawsuit on behalf of his state, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton accused the Bureau of Alcohol, ⁤Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives of overstepping its jurisdiction in introducing the new rule.\n\n“It is with immense pride that I launch this ‌lawsuit today, standing up for our Constitutionally guaranteed liberties against an overreaching federal government,” he declared.\n\nJoining Texas ‌in the ⁢lawsuit are⁣ Louisiana, Missouri,⁤ and Utah, along with Gun Owners ‌of America and other gun rights advocacy organizations. The case was lodged in the federal court⁤ in⁤ Amarillo, Texas,‌ presided over by the sole active⁣ judge, ‍Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Republican appointee of former President Donald Trump. This court has ‌emerged⁤ as a favored venue for conservatives contesting Biden administration policies.\n\nA​ second lawsuit, spearheaded by Arkansas and ‌Kansas and supported⁤ by 19 other states, was filed in Arkansas.⁤ Florida Attorney ‌General Ashley Moody also ⁤lodged a separate complaint in the federal court in⁤ Tampa.\n\nThe​ Justice Department has yet to‍ comment ⁣on the lawsuits.",

        "content": "VICTORIA, Canada — Recent research suggests it’s time⁤ to reassess our relationship with alcohol.\n\nWhile moderate drinking was once believed to be‌ beneficial for ⁤heart health, more sophisticated research⁢ techniques have debunked this theory.\n\n“Reducing alcohol consumption is a fantastic strategy for improving health,”⁤ stated Dr. Timothy Naimi, the director of the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research at⁢ the ​University of Victoria in British Columbia.\n\nAlthough guidelines differ significantly across countries,⁣ the general trend is ⁤leaning ⁢towards reduced alcohol ⁤consumption.\n\nSeveral countries including the United Kingdom, France, Denmark, Holland, and Australia have recently revised their alcohol consumption guidelines based on new evidence. Ireland is set to mandate cancer warning labels on alcohol from 2026.\n\n“The scientific consensus has evolved due to the compelling evidence associating alcohol with over 200 health conditions, such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases,‌ and injuries,” commented Carina Ferreira-Borges, the regional adviser for alcohol at the World Health Organization regional​ office for Europe.\n\nWith initiatives like Dry​ January and Sober‌ October, and bartenders innovating with non-alcoholic cocktails, there’s a growing cultural shift towards reducing alcohol intake.\n\n“People in my age group are much more open to the idea,” shared Tessa Weber, a ⁣28-year-old from Austin, Texas. She decided to participate in Dry January this year after noticing ⁤that alcohol was exacerbating her anxiety. She was pleased with the results — improved sleep, increased energy — and has decided to continue ‍with her reduced alcohol ‌intake.\n\n“It’s beneficial to reassess your⁣ relationship with alcohol,” Weber added.\n\nPrevious ⁢studies that suggested benefits of moderate drinking were flawed, often comparing groups based on their drinking habits at ⁣a single point in time. These studies did not randomly assign participants to drink or abstain, making it impossible ⁤to establish a cause-effect relationship.\n\nDr. Naimi pointed out that moderate drinkers often have higher education levels, higher ⁣incomes, and better access to healthcare. “When you account for these factors, the supposed benefits of moderate drinking ⁢vanish,” ⁤he explained.\n\nAnother issue with these studies is that they often excluded younger participants. Nearly half of the deaths from alcohol-related causes occur before the age of 50.\n\n“If you’re only studying individuals who have survived into middle age, haven’t quit drinking due to problems, and haven’t become‍ heavy⁤ drinkers,‌ you’re looking at a very specific group,” Naimi said. “This creates ⁤a false impression of benefits for moderate drinkers, which is essentially a⁣ statistical mirage.”\n\nOther research contradicts the notion⁤ that alcohol has health benefits. These studies compare individuals with a gene variant that makes drinking unpleasant to those without the variant. Those with the variant tend‍ to⁢ drink very little or not at all. One such study found that individuals⁣ with⁢ the⁤ gene ‌variant have a lower risk of heart disease, further debunking the myth that alcohol protects against heart issues.\n\nAlcohol consumption‍ increases the risk of several types of cancer, including colon, liver, breast, and mouth and throat. Alcohol metabolizes into a substance called acetaldehyde in the ‌body, which can harm cells and prevent them from repairing themselves, creating an environment conducive to cancer growth.\n\nDr. Naimi suggests that thousands of U.S. deaths could be prevented annually if people adhered to the government’s dietary guidelines, which ‍recommend men to limit themselves to two or fewer drinks per day ⁤and women‌ to one or fewer.\n\nOne drink is typically equivalent⁣ to ‌a 12-ounce can of beer, a 5-ounce glass of wine, or a shot of liquor.\n\nNaimi was part of an⁢ advisory committee that proposed lowering the recommendation for men to one drink ⁣per day. However, this advice was overlooked when the federal recommendations were published in 2020.\n\n“The‍ most straightforward message, backed by evidence, is that ⁤if you choose to drink, less is ​better for​ your⁤ health,” Naimi concluded.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical ​Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.",

        "content": "NEW YORK — In‍ a recent‌ announcement, President​ Joe Biden confirmed his willingness to engage in a ⁢debate with his Republican adversary from the November election, former President Donald Trump.\n\n“I am ready, although the exact timing is ​yet to be determined,”‌ the Democratic president shared during an interview with ‌renowned broadcaster Howard⁤ Stern. ⁢”I am more than willing to engage in a debate with him.”\n\nThis statement marks Biden’s‌ most explicit ‍confirmation yet ⁢regarding the possibility of a presidential ⁤debate. Previously, ‍Biden had been non-committal about⁢ debating Trump, stating that his decision​ would⁢ hinge on the former​ president’s conduct.\n\nThe⁤ University of Utah was initially scheduled ⁢to be ⁤the venue⁣ for the third and final⁤ general presidential debate on Oct. ⁤9 in Salt Lake City.\n\nTrump, who had declined to debate his competitors prior to his victory in the ⁢Republican primary race last month, has recently been urging Biden to participate in a one-on-one debate, expressing his readiness to debate⁢ the incumbent Democrat “at⁤ any time, ‌in any location, under any‌ circumstances.”\n\nEarlier this month,‍ Trump’s top two⁤ campaign strategists submitted a letter to an independent commission that⁤ typically authorizes such events, ​advocating for an expedited debate schedule, with more debates than the usual three and starting them earlier in the campaign cycle.\n\nA group of twelve prominent U.S. news outlets have also encouraged the candidates to publicly pledge to debate ⁢each other.\n\nTheir joint statement proposed⁤ that the debates for the current race be sponsored, ⁤as has been the​ case in every election cycle⁤ since ‌1988, by ⁤the impartial ⁢Commission on ‌Presidential Debates.\n\nThere have​ been concerns within Biden’s team that Trump may ⁢not adhere to the⁤ rules established by the⁢ commission once ⁤on stage. Some of Biden’s advisers have⁤ expressed their preference ⁣to ​avoid⁤ giving⁤ Trump a platform⁣ by sharing the stage with the Democratic incumbent.\n\nAccording to ⁢a Reuters/Ipsos poll⁣ conducted earlier ⁤this month, Biden ​currently holds a lead among registered voters,​ with 41% ​support compared to Trump’s 37%.\n\nWhen questioned during a visit to Las Vegas⁣ in early February about Trump’s challenge⁣ for a debate, Biden responded, “If I were in his shoes, ‌I would also​ want to debate ⁤me. He doesn’t have much else going on.”\n\nBiden and Trump previously⁤ went head-to-head in​ two televised presidential election ⁣debates⁣ during the 2020 campaign.",

        "content": "SALT LAKE CITY — The‍ Democratic ⁤Republic ⁤of the Congo, a central African⁣ nation, is currently grappling with a ⁣more lethal​ strain of⁢ monkeypox, now simply referred⁢ to as mpox. This ​new strain has a higher mortality rate compared to the‍ mpox variant that swept across⁤ Europe and the ‍U.S. in ‍2022. The Centers ⁢for Disease Control and Prevention ‌(CDC) is urging individuals at high risk ⁣to get vaccinated.\n\nAccording to a report by U.S. News, “Mpox has been⁤ endemic to Africa for a long time, as ​it ⁢can be ‍transmitted to humans through contact ​with‌ animals such as‍ monkeys.” The​ recent outbreak in the country suggests⁤ “multiple transmissions from animal hosts within” the ‍nation.\n\nThe report further stated, “Fortunately,‍ there is a vaccine for mpox, produced⁣ under​ the brand name ⁣Jynneos. It’s​ a two-dose regimen, ⁢with the shots administered about a month apart.”\n\nThe 2022 outbreak predominantly affected gay and bisexual‍ men, as per ⁣the CDC. With Pride events ⁣on the horizon, public health ⁣officials are ‍advocating for⁤ vaccination. During the outbreak, ‌the U.S. recorded 32,063 cases and ⁤58 deaths. Globally, ⁤the number of cases stood at​ 95,912, according to the‍ CDC.\n\nThe⁤ New York Times reported, “The CDC is concentrating its efforts on encouraging Americans at highest risk to get vaccinated before⁣ the virus makes a comeback. The agency’s outreach initiatives include collaborating ⁤with ‍advocacy groups and social⁤ media influencers who have a wide reach within the LGBTQ+ ‌community. In December, the agency advised ‍clinicians ​to stay vigilant for ‌potential cases ⁤in travelers from Congo.”\n\n“There ‍are two ⁣primary types ‍of ​mpox: Clade ⁣I, the dominant type in Congo, and Clade II, a variant of which caused​ the 2022 global outbreak. (A clade is ‍a genetically and clinically distinct group of viruses.) Both clades have been present in Africa for⁢ decades, occasionally leading to ‍outbreaks,” the Times added.\n\nThe CDC⁤ emphasized on Thursday the importance of controlling the ‍outbreak ⁢in Congo and⁣ preventing its ⁣spread ‌to ⁢other countries.\n\nSigns of‍ mpox\n\nThe initial visible symptom can be⁣ a​ rash, typically found on the hands, feet,⁣ chest, face, mouth, or near the​ genital area. The incubation period ranges⁣ from 3-17 days, during which there are no symptoms. The rash may ⁣resemble pimples or blisters before it‌ scabs over and ⁢heals. ⁣The rash can sometimes cause pain or itching.\n\nOther symptoms can include fever, chills, ⁣swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, muscle and back pain, headache, and respiratory symptoms like nasal ⁤congestion or cough.\n\nThe CDC advises anyone exhibiting these symptoms to seek medical attention⁢ — but‍ to wear a mask when doing ⁢so.\n\nThere’s ⁤no ‌evidence to‍ suggest that asymptomatic individuals‍ can transmit‍ the virus.\n\nTransmission ⁣of mpox\n\nBoth clades can be transmitted through intimate ‌or close personal contact. Pregnant women can pass the virus to a fetus in the womb or to a newborn during and⁤ after ‍birth,‌ as per ‍the CDC.\n\nThe virus ‍can also spread by touching “objects, fabrics, and surfaces that have not ⁣been disinfected after use by ⁣someone with mpox,” according to the CDC. Transmission can begin up to ‍four days before symptoms appear and can continue until the⁢ rash has completely healed and new‌ skin‌ has formed. Mpox can⁢ also be transmitted to humans through contact with animals via direct close contact, including with the infected animal’s fluids or waste, or through⁤ bites and‍ scratches.\n\nThe ⁣CDC ⁣stated that there’s no evidence to⁤ suggest it ‍spreads through water in pools, hot tubs, or splash pads, and it’s known⁤ that the recommended level of chlorine in‍ recreational water venues ​kills the virus.\n\nA ⁢study‍ published in the Journal of ⁣Infectious Diseases revealed that about 1 in 15 unvaccinated adults who visited ⁣a sexual health clinic in ​New York⁤ City were found ⁣to⁣ have ⁤antibodies to⁢ mpox,‍ despite not⁤ being vaccinated or showing ‍any symptoms of infection ‌during the⁣ city’s 2022 mpox outbreak. This suggests,‌ according to researchers, that asymptomatic infections also played​ a role in transmission.",

        "content": "AMSTERDAM — The Burnt Hills-Ballston Lake baseball team showcased their unstoppable offense.\n\nIn a thrilling first round of the Section 2 Class AA baseball tournament against Amsterdam on Thursday evening, Burnt Hills made a remarkable comeback ⁣after the Rams‌ secured an early lead, and the Spartans maintained their momentum till⁢ the end.\n\nA spectacular grand slam by senior Timmy Venditti in ⁤the sixth inning was the icing on the cake in a 15-9 victory for Burnt Hills.\n\n“This was a collective team ⁣victory and we played exceptionally well,” Venditti commented. “We fought hard throughout​ the game and consistently scored ⁣runs​ every inning. We truly gave ⁣it our ⁢all today.”\n\nDespite Amsterdam initiating the scoring with a three-run in the first inning, Burnt Hills ⁢retaliated with four runs in the⁤ second inning. Venditti made his first significant contribution to the game with a two-out, two-run single, giving the Spartans a 4-3 lead.\n\nBurnt Hills ‍further extended⁣ their lead with three ​more ‌runs in the third inning, before ‌Jude Flint hit a solo home ⁢run for Amsterdam, reducing the Rams’ deficit to 7-4.\n\n“Both teams entered the game believing it would be a closely contested match,⁣ and that’s exactly what unfolded,”⁤ Amsterdam coach Robby ⁤Hisert observed.\n\nBurnt Hills managed to stretch its lead​ to 11-4,⁣ scoring two‍ runs in both ⁤the fourth and fifth innings. However, Amsterdam made a comeback with three‍ runs in the fifth inning, bringing the ⁢score to 11-7.\n\nVenditti’s grand slam in the sixth inning⁣ was the final nail in the coffin,​ securing the Spartans’​ first round playoff ​victory.\n\n“I had to take a quick‍ break, and when ‍I returned, I ⁤think it helped us regain our momentum,” Venditti said, referring to the moments before ‍his grand slam. “We were losing steam, and‌ I believe it gave us the boost we needed to secure the win.”\n\nVenditti had an impressive game, going 2 for 4 with six RBIs, while Ben Yerina‍ went 3 for‌ 4. Logan McNeal went 2 for ⁢5 with a double and three ⁣RBIs, and both Christopher Puliafico and Silas Marvin contributed two hits and an RBI each.\n\nLast year, Burnt Hills and Amsterdam faced off ​in the first round of the 2023 ⁣Section 2 Class A tournament, with⁢ the Spartans dominating with a 14-0 mercy rule win.\n\nThis year’s match ​was a different story.\n\n“I knew they were seeking revenge,” Venditti said of Amsterdam. “We had to stop them in their tracks.”\n\nFor‍ Amsterdam, in addition to Flint’s home run, Logan Miller⁤ went 3 for 4, while Patrick⁤ Vidulich went ⁤2 for 4. Ross Sanders contributed 2 for​ 4 with two RBIs, and Giomar Objio went 1 for 4​ with two RBIs.\n\nThe Rams⁣ concluded their season⁣ with a 6-12 overall record.\n\n“This team has been consistent all year,” Hisert said. “They​ never ⁣let their highs ⁤get too ‍high or their lows too ⁢low. They never let mistakes bother them or felt satisfied​ with a good day. They showed up every day to improve.”\n\nBurnt Hills, with an 8-12 overall ⁣record and the No. 10 seed in Class AA,⁤ advances to face No. ​2 ‌Bethlehem ⁢in the quarterfinals on Saturday at 1 p.m.\n\n“I ‌didn’t want today to be‌ our last day,” Venditti said of his team’s win. ‌“We’re determined ⁢to​ keep pushing forward.”\n\nBurnt ⁤Hills-Ballston Lake ‌043 224 0 – 15 ‍14 0\n\nAmsterdam 301 030 2 – 9 10 2",

        "content": "Get ready for some thrilling baseball action as the Section ⁤2 baseball tournament brackets have been ⁤released. Teams from all over the region are ⁢gearing up ⁢to extend ​their seasons and battle​ it out on the⁣ field.\n\nHere are five key points to ‍keep in mind⁢ as we​ head into the playoffs.\n\nTHE SERIES FORMAT\n\nTwo years ago, Section ​2 introduced a best-of-three playoff series to crown its Class AA‍ champion.‌ This year, with the addition of a sixth classification by NYSPHSAA, Section 2 has expanded this best-of-three format.\n\nIn Class AAA, the largest school division, both the semifinal and ⁤championship⁣ rounds will be⁤ a‍ best-of-three series. In⁤ Class AA, only the championship round will ​follow this format. All other classifications, from A to D, will stick to a ⁤single ⁢game format.\n\nThe Class AAA bracket includes five teams. Colonie will host CBA in a play-in game on Wednesday. The victor will then face No. 1 Shenendehowa, the defending⁣ champion, in a semifinal series.\n\nOn the‍ other side of the‍ bracket, No. 2 Saratoga Springs will compete against No. 3 ⁢Shaker in a best-of-three series.\n\nFor the semifinal rounds, teams will alternate home games. ⁣The higher seed will host ⁣Game 1 and, if necessary, ⁣Game 3, while the lower seed will host Game 2.\n\nAll championship series games will be held at the Joseph L. Bruno Stadium.\n\nNISKY LEADS AA\n\nOver the past‍ few years, ​Niskayuna has⁣ been on the brink of ⁣making ⁣a significant run in the Section 2 tournament.\n\nThis ⁤year, the Silver Warriors‍ have secured the top seed‌ in Class AA after‍ an impressive 15-4 overall record. Niskayuna will wait​ for the winner of a first-round game between Averill Park and Troy, as it has a bye to the quarterfinals.\n\nBethlehem secured ‍the No. 2 seed in Class AA, while Ballston Spa took ⁢No. 3‌ and South Glens Falls earned‍ No.​ 4, in⁣ the 12-team field.\n\nThe Class AA semifinals ​and championship series are all‌ set ​to be played at Joseph L. Bruno Stadium.\n\nIMPENDING ⁤SHOWDOWN\n\nChatham has​ secured the top ‌seed in Class C, which may have ignited a competitive spark in Saratoga Catholic.\n\nChatham, the defending ⁣NYSPHSAA Class‍ C champions, posted‍ a 16-4 overall record and went undefeated in the Patroon Conference. However, one of their four losses was against Saratoga ⁢Catholic, which had an 18-2 overall record​ and 12-2 in the Wasaren League.\n\nThe Saints defeated the Panthers 11-8 in ‌a non-league matchup on May 2,‍ and it’s highly likely we’ll see these two‍ teams face off ⁤again at ‘The ⁣Joe’, for the ⁢right to advance to ⁣states.\n\nUNDEFEATED NO. 2\n\nIt’s quite unusual for a team to go ⁢undefeated during the ‍regular season and not secure the top seed in the section tournament.\n\nHowever, ⁢that’s exactly what happened to Mechanicville this ⁣season. Despite a ⁢16-0​ overall record and 14-0 in the Wasaren League, they received the No. 2 ‌seed in Section 2’s Class B bracket.\n\nSchuylerville, ‍with a ​16-4 overall record and⁤ 10-3 in the Foothills ⁢Council, clinched the top seed.\n\nThroughout the season, Mechanicville scored a whopping 202 runs, while allowing just 70.\n\nA potential showdown between Mechanicville ‍and⁤ Schuylerville is brewing as we approach‍ the games at ‘The Joe.’\n\nPATRIOTS ON THE PROWL\n\nMost of Broadalbin-Perth’s current players were ​too young to be ‌a part‍ of the⁤ Patriots’ ‍dramatic run to​ the Section 2 title in 2021. However, they’ve been chasing that feeling ever since.\n\nBroadalbin-Perth is in a strong position to reclaim the top spot, ​as it secured the No. 2 ⁣seed in the Class A bracket, after ​posting a 10-7 overall record⁤ and 10-3 ⁣in the Foothills ‌Council.\n\nThe‍ Patriots⁤ were only bested⁣ by La ⁣Salle, which posted​ a 14-3 overall⁣ record and 12-1 ⁢in the‍ Colonial ⁣Council, to secure⁣ the top seed.\n\nCohoes took the ⁤No. 3 seed⁢ in ⁢the⁤ bracket, while Ichabod ⁣Crane was No. 4, out of the 12-team field.\n\nSCHEDULE\nWEDNESDAY\n\nPLAY-IN\n\nCLASS C — Berlin/New ⁣Lebanon at Hoosic Valley, 4.\n\nFIRST ROUND\n\nCLASS AAA — ‌CBA ⁢at Colonie, ‍4:15.\n\nCLASS AA ‍— Troy at Averill Park, 4; Mohonasen at Queensbury, 4; Burnt Hills-Ballston Lake ‍at Amsterdam, 4; Guilderland at Columbia, 4.\n\nTHURSDAY\n\nFIRST ROUND\n\nCLASS A — Glens Falls at ‌Schalmont, 4; Hudson Falls at Ravena-Coeymans-Selkirk, 4; Gloversville at‍ Scotia-Glenville, 4; Lansingburgh at Albany Academy, 4.\n\nCLASS B — Notre Dame-Bishop‍ Gibbons at Schuylerville,‍ 4; Hudson at Catskill, ⁣4; Corinth at Coxsackie-Athens, 4; Voorheesville at ⁢Mechanicville, 4; Cairo-Durham at Granville, 4; Cobleskill-Richmondville at Taconic Hills, 4; Salem-Cambridge at Johnstown, 4; Stillwater at Fonda-Fultonville,‌ 5.\n\nCLASS C — Berlin or Hoosic Valley at Chatham, ‍4; Waterford-Halfmoon at Middleburgh, 4; Mayfield at ‌Duanesburg,‌ 4; Greenwich at Galway, 4; Lake George at Canajoharie,‍ 4; Schoharie at Hoosick Falls, 4; Berne-Knox-Westerlo at​ Maple Hill, 5; Whitehall at Saratoga Catholic, 7.\n\nCLASS ‌D — Doane/Loudonville at Loudonville, ⁣4.\n\nFRIDAY\n\nSEMIFINALS ⁢GAME 1\n\nCLASS AAA — CBA/Colonie at Shenendehowa, 4; Shaker at Saratoga Springs,‌ 4.\n\nSATURDAY\n\nSEMIFINALS GAME 2\n\nCLASS AAA — Shenendehowa ⁢at ⁢CBA/Colonie, 1; Saratoga Springs⁣ at Shaker, 1.\n\nQUARTERFINALS\n\nCLASS A — ​Schalmont/Glens Falls winner at La Salle, 1; Ravena/Hudson Falls winner at Ichabod Crane, 1; Scotia-Glenville/Gloversville winner at ​Broadalbin-Perth, 1; Albany Academy/Lansingburgh winner at Cohoes,⁢ 1.\n\nCLASS​ B — at higher seeds, 1\n\nCLASS C — at higher seeds, 1\n\nSEMIFINALS\n\nCLASS D — Germantown/Doane winner at Warrensburg, ⁣1; Mekeel Christian Academy at ‍North Warren, 1; Argyke at Hadley Luzerne, 1; Fort⁢ Ann ​at Hartford/Fort Edward, 1.\n\nMONDAY\n\nSEMIFINALS GAME 3\n\n(if‌ necessary)\n\nCLASS AAA — CBA/Colonie at⁤ Shenendehowa, 4; Shaker at Saratoga Springs, 4.\n\nSEMIFINALS\n\nCLASS A — at⁣ Dutchman Park, 4 and 7.\n\nCLASS B — at⁤ Shuttleworth⁢ Park, 4 and 7.\n\nCLASS C — at Gloversville Husky Field, 4 and 7.\n\nCLASS D ⁣— at Lansingburgh, 4 and 7.\n\nMAY 23, 24, 26\n\nCHAMPIONSHIP SERIES\n\n(Best-of-three)\n\nat Joseph L.

In 2022, as a 3-year-old,​ Nations Pride won⁣ the Saratoga Derby Invitational‌ and the‌ Jockey Club Derby Invitational at ⁤Belmont Park.\n\nOutcome: Nations‍ Pride managed to take the lead at the quarter pole, but soon after,‌ he lost it to stablemate Silver Knott and finished third.\n\nWHITEBEAM\n\nWhitebeam, trained by Chad Brown, was ‌the ⁤surprise winner of the ⁤five-horse Grade I ⁤Diana at Saratoga ​last‌ year, despite having the longest betting odds of all the Brown horses. She⁢ is now the‌ even-money favorite for​ the Grade III‌ Beaugay at Aqueduct this Saturday, where she will be making her 2024 debut.\n\nOutcome: In a thrilling​ finish, Whitebeam and Spirit and‌ Glory battled it out down the‍ stretch, only ⁣to be overtaken just before ⁢the⁤ wire by Neecie Marie, ‍thanks to a perfectly timed ride by Joel ⁤Rosario. Whitebeam finished second by a neck.\n\nCONFIDENCE ⁢GAME\n\nConfidence Game, with odds of⁤ 12-1, is the underdog in a seven-horse allowance optional‌ claiming race at Churchill⁤ Downs Park this Saturday. He⁣ is aiming to‍ hit the board for the first time since winning the Rebel at ⁣Oaklawn Park​ on Feb. 25 of last year, a victory ​that earned him a spot‍ in‌ the Kentucky ‌Derby. I wrote about this horse last year because⁤ one⁢ of‌ his ​owners, Rob Slack, a⁤ native of Glens Falls and ‌resident⁤ of Lake‍ George, had a dream of‍ watching Confidence Game ⁣run in ⁢the‍ Travers at Saratoga. However,‌ after finishing 10th in the Derby, trainer Keith Desormeaux decided to give ‌him some time off. Confidence Game ‍started 2024 with a fifth-place finish in the Louisiana Stakes in January. Among the horses he’ll face on Saturday is Hit Show, who was fifth in last year’s Derby.\n\nOutcome: Confidence Game faded to sixth place, while Hit​ Show ⁣emerged as the winner as the‌ even-money betting favorite.",

        "content": "SCHENECTADY — After years ⁣of anticipation, the much-discussed aquatic ‍center is‌ finally ​making its‌ return to ⁣the Electric City. The project​ is‌ set to ‌break ground next year, marking the end​ of a decade-long search for a suitable location.\n\nThe decision was ​made possible after Schenectady‌ County lawmakers approved a partnership with ⁢the Adirondack Aquatic ‍Center and SUNY Schenectady on Tuesday. The facility‌ will be built⁢ on a county-owned plot of ⁣land between State Street and Erie Boulevard, conveniently located ⁤near the ​community ⁤college campus.\n\nAs per ⁣the agreement, all three parties will contribute financially to the project. The State University of New York will cover‌ half of the estimated $41.7 million cost for⁢ the facility, which will feature an ⁢NCAA-compliant eight-lane pool and diving ‌well, an instruction‌ pool, a ⁤therapy pool, and seating for at least 1,200 spectators.\n\nThe ⁢project will also include seating ‍for up to‍ 600 athletes, locker rooms, restrooms and showers, multi-purpose instructional areas, and​ concession space.\n\nThe Adirondack⁢ Aquatic ⁢Center⁣ will contribute 90% of the $21.5 million it has raised ‌since its ⁤inception over a decade‍ ago. This includes‌ $5 million from the federal government, $5.1 million from the state, and $6.4 million in private donations.\n\nThe remaining 10% of funds raised ​by the aquatic center will be allocated to‍ a start-up operational fund of up to⁤ $2 million. The Adirondack Aquatic Center​ will also continue to fundraise for the project, which is expected‍ to break ground next year ⁢and open its⁤ doors ​in 2027.\n\nSchenectady County‌ will contribute $5 million in American Rescue Plan Act funding towards the ⁢project and will cover any of ⁢the remaining 50% balance not covered‌ by SUNY or the‌ aquatic⁣ center​ funding, according to Christopher ‌Gardner, ⁣the county attorney.\n\nThe final cost of the project ‍is yet to be determined. The $41.7 million estimate was completed late last year when the project was ‌expected‍ to ⁤open at the ViaPort shopping mall in Rotterdam. This estimate does not include the cost ⁢of constructing a parking deck that will accommodate around 300 parking spots, Gardner⁣ said.\n\nThe county is also seeking additional‌ state funding through the NY SWIMS program, a $150 million grant initiative included in this year’s state budget that aims to expand municipal pools in​ underserved communities.\n\nSUNY Schenectady will own the facility, which will be ‌constructed⁣ on a block between⁢ State, ‍South Church,‍ South Ferry, and Fuller streets, ⁢adjacent to the college’s dormitory and just a short walk from a CDTA-owned transit hub on State ⁣Street.\n\n“This ⁢will be a championship swim facility,⁣ attracting thousands⁣ of visitors each year, boosting our economy with sales tax⁣ revenue and bed tax revenue, and most importantly, enhancing the stature of SUNY​ Schenectady while providing a ​valuable resource to ⁤our ​community by teaching all of our residents to swim,”⁤ Gardner said. “The project will also enhance the visibility of the college and ‌provide a direct connection to our‍ entire ⁣community — particularly our youth — and should have a very⁣ positive ​impact upon enrollment.”\n\nPlans for an aquatic center that will host collegiate and other levels of competition ​and provide community swim lessons‌ have been in the works for over​ a​ decade ⁢since the facility ⁣was first expected to⁢ open in Malta.\n\nDevelopers initially considered​ a move to Mohawk ⁤Harbor in Schenectady a few years ⁣ago, but those plans were ultimately‌ dropped due to a lack of space at the harbor, where a $50 million hockey arena and event center is currently under construction.\n\nLast July, ⁣leaders at the Adirondack Aquatic Center ⁤announced they had⁤ signed a letter‌ of intent to move the facility to ViaPort, but those⁢ plans fell through after SUNY Schenectady President Steady‍ Moono expressed a desire to keep the ​facility close to‍ campus.\n\n“We had some ⁣discussions with‍ President​ Moono‍ and ​he had a strong preference that it ‌be right there⁢ at the college. If it’s going to ⁣be part of the ​college,⁢ it should be‌ right there at the campus,” Gardner said.\n\nSUNY Schenectady is in the⁤ early stages ‍of⁢ developing programming that⁣ will ‍be⁣ hosted at the facility, including potential athletic, academic, and extracurricular activities.\n\nAs part ⁣of the agreement, the county, SUNY ‌Schenectady, and Adirondack Aquatic Center have ⁣entered into a 20-year agreement that will‌ see the Adirondack Aquatic Center operate the facility and ensures ⁢the ⁤college can fully utilize the⁤ center for intercollegiate meets, ⁤swimming instructions for all students and staff, and community-wide ⁢learn-to-swim programs for children from kindergarten up to 12th ​grade.\n\n“SUNY ⁣Schenectady has long been committed to leading higher education, career advancement, community programming, and overall growth in Schenectady ​County ⁣and ‍the Capital Region,” Moono said ⁢in a statement. “Today’s exciting agreement reaffirms ‍our commitment yet again, and I am⁤ thrilled to help⁤ expand Schenectady’s influence⁢ in New York state by bringing competitive swimming and ⁣overall aquatics to our area in​ such a meaningful way.”\n\nRevenue in excess of operating expenses will be transferred to SUNY Schenectady, which will place the⁤ funds into‍ a ⁢separate ⁢fund to cover the costs of capital repairs and improvements for‍ the facility, according to the agreement.\n\nA seven-member oversight⁣ board ​will also be created, with two seats ⁤each appointed by the county and Adirondack Aquatic Center and three appointed by SUNY Schenectady.\n\nSome ⁤lawmakers heralded the project as transformational and called the plan a​ “win-win.” ‍Josh ‌Cuomo, who represents Rotterdam ‍in District 4, was the lone dissenting vote against approving the agreement.\n\n“I fully support the ‍Aquatic Center and SUNY Schenectady, but I ⁢would ⁢really like ⁤to see this project stay ⁢in‌ Rotterdam, so for that reason ⁤and that reason only — I’m sure my children will be⁣ there quite frequently when​ it’s completed — I am⁤ voting no,” Cuomo said.\n\nKara ⁤Haraden,⁣ board president ⁤of the Adirondack Aquatic Center,‍ thanked lawmakers ⁢for‍ their support and touted ⁤the ⁣aquatic center as‍ an all-inclusive facility that ⁢will ⁣provide programming and⁤ opportunities to community members of all‍ ages and skill levels while creating new⁢ revenue‍ for the county.\n\n“The Capital Region Aquatic Center will be a place that⁢ will⁢ serve all ages ⁣and all abilities, from infants to seniors. A place where​ our‍ community will be able ⁣to ⁤learn, play, heal,​ exercise, train and compete,” she said.",

        "content": "In recent years, The Nest has emerged as a cornerstone of the Schenectady dining landscape.\n\nOperated by Kaytrin and Devin Ziemann under the banner ⁣of ⁢Ziemann Hospitality, The Nest is‌ the sister ⁢establishment⁣ to The Cuckoo’s Nest in Albany. The latter‌ is scheduled to shut its doors on Sunday,‌ May 19, allowing the Ziemanns to concentrate ‌on launching their new Mediterranean restaurant, Milas, ⁢in Schenectady next month. Named after their daughter, Milas will ‍be situated just a‍ stone’s throw away from The Nest on ‌State Street.\n\nThe Nest, a sophisticated⁣ yet unpretentious dining spot,‍ opened its doors ‌in 2020, navigating the changing restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic.‍ This ⁤venture ⁢came just a ⁣few years after the Ziemanns inaugurated The Cuckoo’s Nest. Despite the ⁤risks associated with starting a new business ⁢during such uncertain times, it appears their gamble is paying dividends.‍ The restaurant is ‍typically buzzing throughout the week, and their weekend brunch services have gained such popularity that booking in advance is usually necessary.\n\nOccupying ⁤the former Schenectady Railway‌ headquarters, this two-story restaurant pays homage to Southern cuisine⁤ and classic American dishes. The menu ‌boasts a variety of hearty, flavorful dishes, ⁤including chicken⁢ and waffles, jambalaya, and fried green tomatoes.\n\nThe‍ Gazette recently had a chat with Kaytrin Ziemann about The Nest’s signature dishes and the challenges of establishing​ and managing the restaurant.\n\nQ: Can you share some of the ⁣hurdles you’ve ⁤faced while running The Nest?\n\nA: ⁣We‍ launched during the COVID-19 pandemic, which ⁣presented a ⁤unique set of challenges, including social ⁣distancing rules, bar dividers, limited capacity,‌ and early closing times. People‍ often forget the‍ obstacles⁢ we overcame.\n\nOne of the ​most significant challenges is ⁣managing a large​ staff with diverse personalities.\n\nOne aspect of‍ being a business owner or starting a⁢ business that often goes unmentioned is the personal sacrifices involved. I’ve missed weddings,‍ birthdays, and anniversary⁢ parties. There are things you miss, and ‍you have ​to be okay with it, even if your friends don’t always understand.\n\nWe’ve⁤ made many sacrifices, even with our children. Each time we open⁤ a restaurant, we have to devote ​time away from them to ensure the business’s⁣ success. ‍It’s crucial for our future, but not⁣ everyone understands ​that.\n\nQ: What are the crowd favorites ​at The Nest?\n\nA: Our fried chicken⁣ is a consistent bestseller. It’s a​ three-day cooking process involving a 12-hour brine and a flour and water-based ⁢dredge. It’s dairy-free, which is a plus for ​guests with dairy allergies. ​We even have a dedicated fryer to ⁣avoid ‌shellfish cross-contamination.\n\nOur short ‍rib is another favorite, often competing with⁣ the fried chicken for the top spot. As for drinks, the ⁤Southern Belle, a strawberry lemon ⁣vodka‌ drink ⁢with mint, is our best-selling beverage. Despite ⁢our bartenders’ best efforts to create a more popular drink, the Southern Belle remains unbeaten.\n\nOur fried green​ tomatoes​ and Kaytrin’s biscuits are the most popular appetizers. They’ve been on the menu since​ we opened ‍and continue to be a hit.\n\nQ: ⁣ How would you describe ⁤the ambiance on a typical Friday or Saturday night?\n\nA: I would ‍describe it as lively and bustling. It’s ⁢a ‌happy atmosphere where people ​are enjoying good food.\n\nQ: ‍ What ​is the average cost of a meal here?\n\nA: ⁣ The average dinner bill ⁤per ⁢person is usually around $50.\n\nQ: ‌ Is there anything you’d like‍ people to know about The Nest that they might not be aware of?\n\nA: ⁢ Each service at The Nest offers a unique experience. ⁢Brunch is upbeat with ‌loud pop music and a New York City-like ⁤energy, while dinner offers a more romantic setting. So, if​ you’ve only been here for one service, you haven’t fully ⁤experienced The Nest. ‍It’s a place where you can bring anyone — grandparents, girlfriends, boyfriends — and‌ feel that it’s the ⁢perfect setting for them.\n\nThe Nest is located at 512 State ⁣St., Schenectady. It’s open Tuesday through Friday ⁢from 11:30⁤ a.m. to 4​ p.m. ⁢for lunch and ⁣4:45 to 9:30 ‌p.m. for dinner, with a happy hour at the bar ​from 4 to 6 p.m.​ Saturday brunch runs from 10:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and dinner from 5 to 9:30 ⁣p.m. Sunday brunch runs⁤ from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nFor more details, visit thenest518.com.",

        "content": "SCHENECTADY ⁢— The upcoming Tuesday election for the Schenectady school board‍ is heating up with three ‍candidates, including ⁢incumbent Jamaica Miles, ‌battling for two available seats. Miles is hoping to secure a second three-year term, while newcomers Alexandria Carver and Claudia Cavanagh are‌ eager⁤ to make‌ their debut on the ⁢board.\n\nCarver, currently serving as the city’s director ⁤of development, and Cavanagh, a former employee ‌of ​GE‍ and⁢ the New York State Court of Claims, are set ⁣to ‍challenge ​Miles, the co-founder and executive director of the All Of Us Community​ Action Group, in the⁢ May 21 election.\n\nMiles, who ‌was elected to ​her first term ‌in 2021 after playing a key role in a⁣ state lawsuit that led to full funding of Foundation Aid for ⁤school districts⁣ statewide, expressed⁣ her desire ⁣to continue the‍ work of⁤ the current school board into another term.‍ She highlighted the district’s first grading policy approved by the board in October, ⁣which aims to reduce bias in grading practices.\n\nMiles emphasized her intention to apply the insights gained from her first term to a potential second term⁤ on the​ council.\n\n“The key⁣ is to always ‍provide the time ⁢and space to ⁤listen,” she said.⁤ “This is a lesson I’ve learned over time. Our board is incredibly ‌diverse, ⁣and it’s crucial that we take the time‌ to listen to ‍each other. We all bring different levels of knowledge, understanding, skills, and advice, which makes ⁣us a strong team. It’s ⁢this ‌diversity that ⁣makes us unique.”\n\nCarver expressed confidence in her ability to ‍balance her responsibilities ⁢as director ‌of development with a potential role ‍on the school​ board.\n\n“Our city has so​ much to‌ offer and I’m fully committed here,”⁣ she said. “I understand that my role as the director of development is interconnected with the success ‍of our scholars. ⁢If‍ they succeed, ‌we all succeed.”\n\nCarver, a former ‌Democratic⁤ ward⁤ leader‌ in Albany, revealed that ⁢her decision to run for public⁢ office for the first time was driven by her desire to positively influence⁤ the district where‌ two of her three children are enrolled.\n\n“Their educational trajectory is ⁤my‌ top priority,” Carver said. ⁤“My goals are to stand with our teachers and​ educators to ensure that preventive and supportive services ⁣are​ available. I aim‌ to strengthen the‌ relationship between⁤ academics and the community, enhance partnerships with our community organizations, and foster⁤ a collaborative environment.”\n\nCavanagh, who retired ⁢as the Principal Office Assistant with the ⁤New York​ State Court of Claims, was ⁤motivated to run after learning about the district’s chronic absenteeism issues.\n\nThe district’s second quarter ​academic​ report released this spring ⁣revealed that each of its elementary schools saw⁤ drops in attendance between the first‌ and second‌ quarters of the 2023-2024 school year.​ Over half of​ district first and second‌ graders were deemed chronically absent in the second‍ quarter.\n\nCavanagh expressed⁤ her desire ‍to see the district offer civil service exam classes ‍for 11th grade students to secure jobs after graduation.\n\nShe also highlighted the⁣ district’s struggles with state test scores as a priority⁣ if she were ⁤elected. Despite making ‌incremental progress over the previous year, more than 83% of district students‍ in​ grades 3-8 were not proficient in 2023 state ⁤math scores.\n\n“I’m deeply concerned ‍that these kids aren’t learning,” Cavanagh ⁤said on​ Thursday. “They’re not thriving.‍ Not all, but most. Regardless of what the​ district does, or what buildings they ​buy, you can invest in anything you want. But until we have⁤ more kids‌ passing than not, they can ⁣come up ⁤with ⁤all sorts of ideas for buildings or more social⁤ workers. We need to understand why these kids aren’t learning. I believe they’re being distracted. They’re‌ learning ⁣a lot‍ in school, except for‌ reading,‍ writing, and arithmetic.”\n\nAt a candidate⁣ forum Thursday night hosted⁢ by⁢ the League of Women Voters held‌ at the district’s Liberty Street offices, the three ⁣candidates shared their visions for the‌ district and offered differing viewpoints on issues such as school resource officers (SRO), charter⁢ schools, and book banning in Schenectady schools. Cavanagh often expressed conservative viewpoints during the forum, while the ⁢progressive Miles frequently took opposing ⁣stances.\n\nFollowing unrelated incidents at Oneida Middle School in January and Mont Pleasant Middle School in April, the district launched an online safety survey ​asking students, staff, and residents how ​the district could improve its safety practices.\n\nDuring the Thursday forum, the ⁣candidates ⁢responded to a question about⁢ the effectiveness of the district’s SRO program that ‍places Schenectady‌ police officers in city schools.\n\nThe district initiated ⁣a pilot program in 2021 to bring a pair of community engagement officers into the district, with the⁢ school⁤ board subsequently approving a plan⁢ in 2022 to expand the program to six officers.\n\n“I ⁢believe that having officers in our‍ schools will also foster a⁣ connection within our community,” Carver⁢ said on Thursday. “We are aware of the negative narrative associated with ⁣our ​low-to-moderate-income families in our​ urban areas when it comes to our‌ police officers. Based on the studies I’ve read,⁢ our officers are building connections⁣ with the young people in⁤ our schools.”\n\nMiles expressed her​ concerns⁢ about the effectiveness of the SRO program.\n\n“The research clearly‍ shows that more police does not increase ⁤safety or foster an overall positive climate in our schools,” she said during⁣ the forum.\n\nMiles added that she supports the district’s school safety team of local residents who work within⁢ the buildings,⁤ wearing ⁢red shirts and guiding students throughout the day.\n\nCavanagh strongly endorsed the district’s SRO​ program.\n\n“The SROs⁢ are great,” she⁣ said after the forum. “They have to be there because of the situation across the country and in‍ the ⁣area. We’re finding kids with ​knives and guns and things like that. That’s unacceptable.”\n\nIn response to an audience question about the candidate’s‌ stances on charter schools, Miles argued that charter schools drain funds ‍from public​ schools.\n\n“I see them as a drain on public schools,” Miles said⁤ during the⁣ forum. “While they‍ are praised as a choice ⁣for ⁤parents, they actually take resources away ‍from our buildings.”\n\nCarver, whose children attended a charter school before the family moved to Schenectady, expressed ⁢a ⁢different view.\n\n“We should have options,” Carver said during the forum. ​“I’m not ⁤against charter schools.⁤ I understand they may drain some of ⁣the resources, but I believe there’s enough resources for our city to have options.”\n\nCavanagh supported ‍the idea of charter schools during the forum.\n\n“I’m for school choice,” ‍Cavanagh said ⁢on Thursday. “I believe in any ⁤school, whether ‌it’s private, public,‍ or a charter school,⁣ as ‍long​ as the value of the children’s education is upheld.”\n\nAn audience question about the candidate’s ⁣stances on banning books in Schenectady schools saw Miles ⁢and Carver both opposed to the‌ idea.\n\n“Our goal within our district is‌ to foster ⁣lifelong learning ⁢for⁣ these individuals ⁤and to help​ them become critical⁣ thinkers⁤ capable⁤ of making objective decisions,”‌ Miles said.\n\nCavanagh stated that she would support⁤ banning books under certain circumstances.\n\n“I have‍ no ⁢problem banning books that are inappropriate⁣ for age groups‍ that are too young to understand the information in the books,” Cavanagh said during the ⁢forum. “There are certain⁤ things you⁣ don’t understand until you’re older and you need a solid foundation of education and⁤ critical ⁣thinking‌ skills before you ​tackle different ⁢subjects.”\n\nThe seven-member Schenectady school board is composed entirely ‍of female ⁢members, with all three ⁤of ‍this year’s ⁤candidates being women ⁢of color.\n\n“We may‌ all be women, but we are very different women,” Miles ​said of ​the current board.‍ “The current structure is majority women of color and after the election, we’ll still be majority women​ of color ‌no‍ matter who wins, but ⁤we⁣ still have that diversity of views.”\n\nThe school board election and voting ⁢for the district’s proposed $277.7 million 2024-2025 ‍school budget will take place on ⁢Tuesday from noon to ‍9:00 p.m. at district polling locations.",

        "title": "Inflation fears among America’s small businesses are rising again and their faith in the Fed is falling",
        "image": "https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/4791-107385774-17101820702024-03-11t183300z_286094198_rc2uj6anix0t_rtrmadp_0_usa-election-biden-1068x601.jpeg",
        "content": "The fight against inflation was going well for the Federal Reserve and economy for much of last year and into 2024, but one important demographic remained unconvinced about the progress being made in lowering pricing: small business owners.\n\nNow, more influential parties are coming around to a view that small businesses have been stubborn in saying is closer to the on-the-ground truth: inflation isn’t coming down fast enough. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell conceded that after three months of disappointing data on inflation, there has been a “lack of further progress” this year. Market traders, who not long ago were in interest rate cut euphoria mode and forecasting up to six rate cuts by the Fed this year, are now more likely to see one or two cuts at most.\n\nDisappointment over inflation is nothing new for small business owners, and their frustration over high prices is increasing again, according to the WHNY News|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey for Q2 2024.\n\nOne in four (24%) small business owners tell WHNY News that they think inflation has reached a peak, down from 29% in the previous quarter, and back to where the economic sentiment reading was a year ago. The percentage of small business owners who expect inflation to rise from here is trending up as well — 75% this quarter, up from 69% in Q1.\n\n“Small business owners are the engine of our economy, and the data shows they are still pessimistic about overcoming inflation,” Lara Belonogoff, senior director of brand management and research at SurveyMonkey, said in a statement upon the Q2 survey’s release.\n\nThis WHNY News|SurveyMonkey online poll was conducted April 8-12, 2024 among a national sample of 2,130 self-identified small business owners ages 18 and up.\n\nDespite a positive market reaction to Fed Chair Powell’s comments after the FOMC meeting on Wednesday — in the least, Powell all but ruled out another rate hike this year — small business confidence in the Fed has declined. Last quarter, a little over one-third (35%) of business owners said they had confidence in the Fed. That’s not fallen back to 31%, where it was in Q2 of last year.\n\n“Inflation remains a top concern, clearly, for small businesses,” said U.S. Small Business Administration head Isabel Casillas Guzman in an interview with WHNY News’s Kate Rogers at the virtual Small Business Playbook event on Thursday. “We’ve tried to make sure the SBA is more readily available to credit worthy borrowers out there. Half of businesses don’t get the capital they need fully, or at all.”\n\nShe suggested small business owners start with local SBA resource partners, local district offices, which can connect them with lenders on the ground, as well as starting with the SBA’s online Lender Match tool.\n\nOne finding over which small businesses are in line with a broader macro view is the overall state of the economy. Over one-quarter (27%) describe the economy as “excellent or good,” which has not trended lower even as inflation fears have picked back up. It’s also notably up from 21% in the year-ago quarterly survey. The economy’s performance helps explain why nearly three times as many business owners cite inflation as the biggest risk they face (37%) compared to the No. 2 threat, consumer demand, at 13%.\n\nSBA Administrator Guzman cited the 17.2 million new business applications filed during the Biden administration as a sign of the economic optimism despite inflation. She pointed to the Biden legislation that is spurring government spending on infrastructure and clean energy, which are economic growth drivers. “These are all small business trades across those opportunities,” she said. “That’s the economic growth the president has been focused on.”\n\nIncreasingly, though, it’s also a fiscal policy-linked spending plan and rise in federal debt that economists are tying to sticky inflation.\n\nThe WHNY News|SurveyMonkey Small Business Confidence Index was unmoved quarter-over-quarter, at 47 out of 100, and up one point from Q2 of last year.\n\nThe WHNY News|SurveyMonkey data is consistent with other recent small business survey findings. Goldman Sachs’ 10,000 Small Businesses Voices survey released this week cited 71% of small business owners saying inflationary pressures have increased on their businesses over the past three months and 49% saying they’ve had to raise the prices. In the WHNY News survey, 48% said they are raising prices.\n\nInflation will loom large in how America’s small business owners tilt in the presidential election.\n\nInflation is the No. 1 issue over which small business owners say they will vote, with 63% of survey respondents citing it, followed by economic growth at 61%.\n\nConfidence in President Biden’s handling of the presidency — which is typically low in a small business demographic that skews conservative — remains underwater in the new survey, at 31%, down by two percentage points quarter over quarter. Among Republican small business owners taking the survey, 5% approve of the job Biden is doing. Among Democrats, 82% of small businesses approve of Biden, though pollsters say that approval ratings under 90% within one’s own party are a signal of dissatisfaction.\n\nBiden has made some gains with his supporters, with the overall Small Business Confidence Index reading among this survey subset unchanged quarter over quarter at 61, and up from 55 in Q3 of 2023.\n\nThe WHNY News survey found that in one area, small business owners who identify as either Republicans or Democrats do reach a rare point of consensus: both say that when it comes to government policy, they are getting slighted compared to large corporations.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs survey found that 55% of business owners are unhappy with the amount of focus small business issues get from candidates. Inflation, at 73%, was the issue cited most frequently.\n\nGuzman said that the SBA has doubled the number of small-dollar loans, including to startups, as well as to women and people of color, who she noted are starting businesses at the highest rates. She also said more of the government loan volume is going into “rural banking deserts.”\n\nAnd the total amount of government contracts going to small businesses has reached 28%, Guzman said, roughly $178 billion, according to the recent government scorecard. “We want more people to do business with the largest buyer in the world,” she said. ",

        "content": "The Junior Achievement Free Enterprise Center located in Greenwood Village, Colorado, is where high school students can explore careers and develop a plan to pursue their goals. The center aims to inspire the next generation of entrepreneurs.\n\nEntrepreneurship is a common goal for younger people.\n\nMore than half, or 54%, of Gen Z adults say that they think they’d be happier owning their own business than working a normal day job, according to WHNY News and SurveyMonkey’s new Workforce Survey. The survey polled 5,993 U.S. adults in the workforce in early April — including 770 Gen Z respondents age 27 and younger.\n\nMore from Your Money:\n\nHere’s a look at more stories on how to manage, grow and protect your money for the years ahead.\n\nWith a good credit score, ‘doors will open.’ But many face a roadblock\n100-year-old still has $1 million saved: ‘I always lived within my means’\nMiddle-class Americans want to know how the wealthy make money\n\n“There’s a recipe for finding your path to purpose,” said Robin Wise, the president and CEO of Junior Achievement Rocky Mountain. “It’s seeing people do things that you might want to do. It’s knowing yourself.” \n\nIn partnership with Junior Achievement, WHNY News brought together business leaders in the Denver area to speak with students about their journey in founding a company. Here are five key pieces of advice that they shared:\n\n‘Embrace what makes you different’ \n\nDarian Simon co-founded the clothing company Be a Good Person in 2015 to inspire positivity. He advises young people to “embrace what makes you different.”\n\nSimon was diagnosed with autism and ADHD, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, at age 28. Now 30, he said he rejects the “disorder” part of the diagnosis and embraces it as his superpower.\n\n“My greatest strengths are my neurodivergence because I have less inhibitive space in my brain, therefore I can ideate better,” he said. “Therefore the box doesn’t really exist in the same ways.”\n\nValue adaptability\n\nRobin Thurston sold his digital fitness technology start-up to Under Armour for $150 million in 2013. He recently founded Outside Interactive, a network of media brands in endurance sports, the outdoors and healthy living.\n\nHe compares starting a business to going on a difficult hike and advises keeping that analogy in mind as you embark on the journey — you’ll need to embrace the unknown, recognize that things are unlikely to go according to plan and work through inevitable difficulties, he said.\n\n“That’s what great entrepreneurs do,” Thurston said. “They’re resilient, and they work their way through those challenges.” \n\nRecognize challenges ‘as opportunities’\n\nCamila Uzcategui co-founded Vitro3D, a company that uses 3D printing-like technology in advanced manufacturing spaces, in 2020. She said her background in physics and interest in experimenting with technology taught her the value of failure. \n\n“In all of those challenges, I like to see them as opportunities to either pivot into a potentially new direction or pivot into a better way of understanding something,” Uzcategui said.\n\nExpect excellence from your team\n\nMowa Haile founded Sky Blue Builders, a construction company, during the Great Recession in 2009. He said it’s important to surround yourself with people who share your passion — and always expect excellence from them.  \n\n“When you’re an entrepreneur and you have a team, you’re there to coach them and lead them and encourage them,” he said. \n\nSurround yourself with the right people\n\nLara Merriken founded Larabar, a company that makes vegan, gluten-free, plant-based bars, in 2000 after a career in social work.\n\n“A lot of people were literally naysayers,” she recalled. “They were just like, why would you do this? Why would you get into a category that’s oversaturated?” \n\nShe said that identifying and working with trusted confidants who were supportive and encouraging were critical to the company’s success. She sold Larabar to General Mills in 2008 for about $55 million. \n\nAnother recipe for success is to learn from other entrepreneurs’ stories, Merriken said. “While we have our companies, we still need inspiration every day.”\n\nSIGN UP: Money 101 is an 8-week learning course to financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox.\n\nDon’t miss these exclusives from WHNY News PRO\nHere are Wednesday’s biggest analyst calls: Tesla, Amazon, Airbnb, Domino’s, Walmart, Disney & more\nForget Nvidia: Morgan Stanley says Intel’s much-hyped AI chip will boost 3 global stocks \nAnalysts love this gold explorer’s stock — and even the most cautious expect it to soar 114%\nBank of America upgrades Tesla, says first-quarter report opens door for strong gains ahead \nThis biotech stock specializing in targeted cancer treatments can surge 50%, Jefferies says\nHere’s where to invest $1 million right now, according to the pros ",

        "content": "Small business confidence hit its lowest level in more than 11 years for March as proprietors worried that inflation is still very much a problem.\n\nAt a time when other data points show inflation receding, the National Federation of Independent Business reported Tuesday that its survey showed a reading of 88.5, down nearly a point from February and the lowest since December 2012.\n\nA quarter of all respondents reported that rising costs were the biggest problem.\n\n“Small business optimism has reached the lowest level since 2012 as owners continue to manage numerous economic headwinds,” NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said. “Inflation has once again been reported as the top business problem on Main Street and the labor market has only eased slightly.”\n\nA quarter of all respondents cited inflation, and in particular higher input and labor costs, as their most pressing issue. A net 28% reported raising average selling prices for the month and 33% planned additional price hikes, according to seasonally adjusted data.\n\nAs part of those escalating costs, a net 38% said they raised compensation, up 3 percentage points from the February reading that was the lowest since May 2021. The Labor Department on Friday reported that average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in March and 4.1% from a year ago.\n\nThe survey comes with other indicators showing that inflation, while not eradicated, is at least receding.\n\nA Commerce Department measurement of personal consumption expenditures prices put the annual inflation rate at 2.5% in February. The measurement, which the Federal Reserve uses as its main inflation gauge, showed a 2.8% level when excluding food and energy, which policymakers prefer as a better sign of longer-run trends.\n\nThe consumer price index, a more widely watched figure by the public, will be released Wednesday and is expected to show a 3.4% headline rate and 3.7% on core. Fed policymakers target 2% annual inflation.\n\nInflation expectations have been fairly well-anchored in recent months. A New York Fed survey on Monday showed respondents for March expected a 3% rate over the next year, unchanged from February. The three-year outlook rose slightly but the five-year expectation decreased.\n\nHowever, the survey did show a big jump in the expectations for rent increases — by 8.7% over the next year, a 2.6 percentage point surge from February. Declining shelter inflation is at the core of the Fed’s thesis that inflation will continue to ebb toward the central bank’s 2% target, allowing for interest rate cuts later in the year.\n\nFed survey respondents also said they expect prices to rise substantially for most other major components. They see gas prices up 4.5% in the next year and food up 5.1%, both 0.2 percentage points higher than the February survey.\n\nDon’t miss these stories from WHNY News PRO:\nFive stocks to buy and hold for the long term, according to the pros\nThese are Piper Sandler’s favorite stocks for the second quarter \nEnergy might be the ‘story of the summer,’ one chief investment officer says.

        "content": "NEWBERRY, S.C. — The residents of a county in​ South Carolina are⁢ experiencing an unusual phenomenon. The sound of emerging cicadas is so deafening that it​ has ‍led to numerous calls to the local sheriff’s office, with people inquiring about the source of​ the loud sirens or roaring noise.\n\nThe Newberry County Sheriff’s Office took to Facebook on Tuesday⁣ to clarify the situation. They explained that the high-pitched noise is ​simply the song of male cicadas. After spending over a decade underground, these insects have surfaced and are now singing to attract their mates.\n\nAccording to Newberry County Sheriff ⁣Lee Foster, some residents have even stopped ⁢deputies on the road to ask about the strange noise. The loudest cicadas seem to be moving around the county, which‌ is home‌ to approximately ​38,000 ⁣people and located​ about 40 miles northwest⁣ of Columbia. This has resulted in calls from various locations throughout the day, Foster added.\n\nTrillions of red-eyed ​periodical⁤ cicadas are currently emerging from the ground ​in‍ the eastern U.S. These cicadas belong to broods that surface⁣ either every 13 or 17 years. Their collective song can reach volumes comparable ‌to jet engines, prompting scientists who study ⁣them to wear earmuffs for hearing protection.\n\nAfter Tuesday’s ‌experience, Foster now ‍understands why these precautions are necessary. However, he reassured county residents in his statement,‌ “Although to some, the noise is annoying, they‍ pose no danger to humans or pets,” Foster wrote. “Unfortunately, it is the sounds of nature.”",

        "content": "DENVER —\n\nAmong the 13 victims of the ⁢Columbine High School shooting, remembered during a vigil on the eve of⁤ the 25th anniversary ⁢of the tragic⁢ event, ‌were a young girl who penned her thoughts to God ‍in her diaries,‌ a boy grappling with learning disabilities and beginning to accept himself, ⁣and a teenager who cherished every spare moment he could spend ‍fishing. At ⁤the time, this shooting was​ the most devastating the country had ever⁣ witnessed.\n\nThirteen empty chairs were adorned with flickering candles, each representing a life lost. Brief ⁢biographies ⁤of the victims,⁤ including students Rachel Scott,⁣ Kyle Velasquez, and Corey DePooter, ⁣were read aloud. After‍ each biography, the crowd of approximately 150 people responded in unison with the phrase ⁣”never forgotten,” followed by⁤ the tolling of a ⁣bell.\n\nThe youngest⁤ victim of the attack, which has since⁤ inspired ‍numerous‍ similar incidents, was 14-year-old Steven Curnow. The oldest was Dave ‍Sanders, a 47-year-old teacher who ‍bravely led⁤ students to safety from the cafeteria and was shot while attempting to guide students upstairs into classrooms.\n\nOther victims included Cassie Bernall, Kelly Fleming, Matt Kechter, Daniel Mauser, Dan Rohrbaugh, Isaiah Shoels, John ​Tomlin, and Lauren Townsend.\n\nConi Sanders, daughter of ⁤Dave‍ Sanders, expressed that her father’s​ heroic ​actions forever changed the world by saving hundreds of ⁢students. “The children ​he saved now have ⁣their own ‌families. Generations ⁤from now, people will ‌know they exist ⁢because of his bravery,” she stated before the ceremony commenced.\n\nThe ​vigil, organized by advocates including ⁢gun safety organizations, was the primary public event commemorating the ‌anniversary. ⁤The ⁣event not only honored​ those who lost their lives but also acknowledged those who ​were injured and those who survived but were left traumatized.\n\nTom Mauser, father⁤ of victim ‌Daniel Mauser, decided to ⁣organize the vigil after discovering that school officials had no ⁢plans to host a large​ community event as they ​had on the 20th anniversary.⁣ Mauser, ⁤who became a gun safety ⁣advocate following the shooting, implored the ​crowd to remember the victims​ of Columbine ⁢and to take action to reduce gun violence.\n\n“Above all,⁣ we ask you to ⁤never forget the victims of ​Columbine. The slain, the ⁢injured, the traumatized, and their families. And especially never forget ⁤those⁢ who lost their lives,” Mauser said, wearing his ⁢son’s sneakers, a‍ tradition he reserves for special occasions.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, in a ⁣statement released on Saturday,‍ highlighted the steps his administration‍ has ​taken to curb the “senseless violence” that has impacted approximately 400 schools since Columbine. This includes the establishment of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention.\n\n“I’ve⁤ met with ⁤countless families who’ve lost loved ones because of gun violence. Their message ⁤is⁢ always the same: do something,”⁢ the statement ​read. “My administration‌ will continue taking action, but ‍Congress must do their part. ⁢We need universal background checks,⁣ a national red flag law, and we must ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.”\n\nFormer Arizona congresswoman Gabby ⁣Giffords, who‌ was nearly killed in a mass shooting and has since become‍ a gun safety advocate, attended the ‍vigil. ⁢She spoke about‍ her ‌lengthy recovery and the small steps necessary​ to effect change in ​the world.\n\n“Change doesn’t happen ‍overnight, and we can’t do it alone.⁤ Join ​me. Let’s move ahead together,” she ⁤said, earning a standing⁢ ovation from the crowd.\n\nNathan Hochhalter, whose⁤ sister Anne ⁣Marie was paralyzed in the‌ Columbine shooting, shared his experience of being trapped in a classroom with about 30 students, hearing ⁣gunfire nearby. They were ‍rescued about four hours later by⁢ SWAT⁤ officers. Six months after the incident,⁣ his mother, who suffered from ‌bipolar disorder, tragically ended her own life.\n\n“I just want ⁣to use this moment to let everyone know that ‌it’s ​OK to ask ⁣for help, whatever your situation is whether, either as a ⁢survivor⁣ 25 years later or someone struggling with any part of their ​life. These things ⁤come in waves⁣ and⁤ they can hit you when you⁢ least expect it. You should all know that we’re all here for ⁤you and that you’re not alone,” Hochhalter said.",

        "image": "https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4690-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg",
        "content": "WASHINGTON — The Senate‍ is⁤ considering⁤ amending the bill that mandates TikTok to separate from ⁢ByteDance, potentially extending the ‌timeframe⁣ for⁤ the compulsory sale‍ to be completed.\n\nIn essence, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would⁢ compel ⁢TikTok to sever ties with ByteDance within a six-month period, failing which it would face a de facto ban. The ‍bill could ‌potentially affect more than just TikTok, as it ​empowers the executive branch to identify other companies that meet the specified criteria for posing a threat to ⁤national security and ​enforce‌ a sale.\n\nSen. ⁤Maria‍ Cantwell, D-Wash.,⁢ expressed to The Wall Street Journal her openness ‌to prolonging the timeframe stipulated in the bill, currently set ⁢at six ‌months. This could “provide the opportunity to actually execute a transaction and⁣ perhaps achieve ⁢a⁢ bit more, not ‍stability, but identify the ⁣appropriate divestiture,” she shared ⁤with the publication.\n\nIt remains uncertain how much the Senate’s version of the​ bill will deviate from the one the House passed earlier this ⁤year. ​The ⁣bill received ​bipartisan support, ⁣including from Utah’s House delegation,‍ but has ​encountered more ​opposition in the ⁤Senate, with criticisms ranging from First Amendment concerns to issues⁤ regarding ⁤the amount of ‌authority it would grant the executive branch.\n\nAs it currently stands, the ⁢House’s version of the⁤ bill would delegate authority to the executive ‌branch to determine if an app poses a threat to national ⁢security based on certain criteria and enforce a sale ⁣of ‍the app.⁢ Critics of the bill,⁣ including ⁣Sen. Mike Lee, ⁢R-Utah, ‍have‍ issues with this aspect ⁣of the ⁤bill.\n\nProponents of the‍ bill have drawn parallels with other similar ‍regulations.\n\nFCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel recently voiced her‌ support for ‌the⁤ bill, as reported‍ by Deadline. “We don’t have jurisdiction over apps like TikTok,” ⁤Rosenworcel was⁣ quoted as saying. “However, what ​strikes‍ me most is that for decades ‌we’ve had policies in the Communications Act that would prohibit, for ⁤example, a Chinese‌ national or a Chinese company from owning our nation’s broadcast television stations.”\n\n“We would deem that unacceptable, correct?”‍ Rosenworcel added. “I’d lose my job if ‍I decided otherwise. ‌Yet⁣ here we have something that’s arguably one of the newer forms of media and there⁤ is absolutely‌ no⁣ oversight. I find that astonishing.”\n\nTikTok ​itself⁤ is against ⁣the bill and ​previously told the Deseret ⁣News, “This will harm millions of businesses,​ deprive artists of an audience and ruin the livelihoods of countless creators nationwide.”\n\nUnlike other attempts to regulate social media nationwide, ⁤this bill ‌focuses on⁢ the issue of national security rather than mental health.\n\nPoliticians have ⁤been briefed‌ about the potential national security threats in ​classified‍ sessions, so the public doesn’t ⁣have⁤ a front-row view of the ​specifics of those ‌threats. Axios reported ‍on one such briefing where ​two senators, who were not named in the story,⁣ mentioned that what ‍they heard involved how TikTok collects and processes ⁤user data.\n\nThe way TikTok‌ manages data has been a focal​ point of the discussion⁣ and there are ongoing⁤ questions surrounding this⁢ issue.\n\nTikTok executives proposed Project Texas, which would completely segregate U.S. data from the rest of the‍ company‍ to alleviate lawmakers’ concerns about how the ⁢company manages data.\n\n“The crux ⁤of the matter is ‌that this⁢ is American data, stored on ⁣American soil by an American company, supervised by American personnel,” TikTok‌ CEO Shou Zi Chew​ testified⁢ before Congress. “This eliminates ⁤the concern⁤ that some of ⁤you have expressed to‌ me that TikTok user data can be subject to Chinese law.”\n\nAs⁢ per ​The⁢ Wall Street​ Journal, ⁢as of January, “TikTok is struggling to fulfill those promises.”\n\nThe Journal reported that​ “managers occasionally ⁢instruct employees to share data⁢ with colleagues in other parts of the company and with ByteDance employees without using official channels,‍ according to ‍current and former employees⁤ and internal documents viewed by The Wall⁣ Street Journal.” Reportedly this data includes birthdates and IP addresses.\n\nFormer TikTok employees told Fortune that “at least some of TikTok’s operations were intertwined with its parent during their tenures, and that the company’s ‌independence⁣ from China was ⁤largely superficial.”",

        "content": "DETROIT ⁣— Ford ⁤has ⁢issued a recall for nearly 43,000‍ of its small ​SUVs due⁤ to a potential fire ‍risk.‌ The issue ⁤stems ⁤from the possibility ‌of ‍gasoline leaking from the fuel injectors‌ onto hot ⁤engine surfaces. However, the recall solution does ⁢not involve fixing the fuel leaks.\n\nThe recall pertains to‌ specific Bronco Sport SUVs from the 2022 and ⁣2023⁣ model years, as well ⁤as 2022 Escape SUVs. All ⁢the‍ affected vehicles are equipped with 1.5-liter engines.\n\nAccording to documents submitted to U.S. safety regulators, Ford has identified that fuel injectors⁢ can crack, leading to gasoline or vapor accumulation near ignition sources. ⁢This could potentially ignite ‌fires.\n\nAs a ‍remedy, dealers will install a tube to direct gasoline away from hot surfaces, allowing it to flow to the ground beneath ​the vehicle.​ Additionally, they will update the engine control software to detect ​any pressure drop in the fuel injection system. If ​such a situation arises,‌ the software will disable the high-pressure​ fuel pump, reduce engine ⁤power, and ​lower engine‍ compartment temperatures. This information was made public on Wednesday via​ the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website.\n\nVehicle ​owners were expected to receive notification letters starting April 1.\n\nAccording​ to ⁢Ford’s documents, there have been five reported under-hood ⁢fires and 14 warranty ⁣replacements of fuel injectors. However, there have been no​ reports of accidents or ⁣injuries.\n\nIn a statement, Ford clarified that it is not⁢ replacing fuel injectors as⁢ it⁣ believes the recall​ repairs “will prevent the failure⁤ from occurring and protect the customer.” The updated software ​will also activate a dashboard warning light, enabling customers to drive to ‌a safe location, stop⁣ the vehicle, and arrange for service. Ford’s documents ‍indicate that ‍the problem only⁤ affects‍ about 1% of the SUVs.\n\nFurthermore, Ford has announced that⁣ it will extend warranty coverage‌ for cracked fuel injectors. This means that owners who encounter this problem will⁢ receive​ replacements. Ford has confirmed⁢ that repairs are already available, and ⁤details of the extended warranty will be released in June.\n\nThis ⁣recall is an⁣ extension ⁤of a 2022 recall​ for the‌ same issue. The​ repair has‍ been tested on vehicles involved in the previous recall, and Ford has ‍reported no known issues.\n\nDespite the potential ‌fire risk, Ford is not advising that the SUVs be parked exclusively outdoors‌ as there is no evidence to‌ suggest that fires occur when⁣ vehicles are parked with the engines off.\n\nMichael ‌Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, criticized⁤ Ford’s solution⁣ for the fuel leaks as a “Band-Aid type recall.” He suggested that the company is trying to sidestep the cost of repairing the fuel injectors.\n\nBrooks pointed⁤ out that a 1% failure rate is significant. Even with the proposed repairs, ⁣drivers could still be⁢ forced to exit a freeway at a low speed, potentially putting them at risk ‍of an accident.\n\nHe urged the safety administration​ to‍ do more to ⁤ensure recalls address the root ⁤causes of vehicle ⁤problems, rather than opting for less expensive repairs.\n\nPreviously, the safety board has stated that it does not have the legal authority to pre-approve recall fixes. However, ‌in a statement released on Wednesday, the agency said⁣ it ‍will‍ “closely track their ⁤performance using field data.” The agency advised owners with questions to contact their dealership​ or Ford.\n\nBrooks called ​on‌ Congress to amend ⁢the law so the agency can ‍”require something more ⁢than the rubber stamp that⁢ NHTSA is currently deploying” ‍on recalls.\n\nHe noted that the​ agency has recently been⁣ more proactive in investigating recall fixes. “That is a post-remedy inquiry that won’t make ‌the fixes better, and further stretches out the process and leaves consumers in limbo,” he added.",

        "content": "From the heart of⁤ SALT LAKE⁤ CITY, a unique challenge has emerged for President Joe Biden‍ regarding his ⁢potential candidacy⁤ in Ohio‍ for the 2024 elections. The state’s law presents a conundrum that⁢ requires either an early certification of Biden as the Democratic candidate for 2024, two weeks ahead of the ⁤planned schedule,​ or a special exception from ⁣the Ohio ⁣Legislature.\n\nOhio’s Secretary of⁣ State, Frank LaRose, penned a letter‌ to Liz Walters, the Chairwoman of the‍ Ohio​ Democratic Party, outlining these concerns.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention, where Biden is expected to be officially declared as the nominee, is set to take ⁤place on August 19. However, ⁢Ohio’s law stipulates that candidates must be certified by August 7.\n\nLaRose’s letter, which was first made public by ABC News, stated, “Therefore, pending further clarification, I am left⁣ to conclude that the Democratic‌ National Committee ⁣must either move ⁤up its‌ nominating ‍convention or the Ohio General Assembly must ⁣act by May 9, 2024 (90 days prior to ⁢a new law’s​ effective ⁣date) to create an exception to this statutory requirement.”\n\nThe letter further urged the⁤ Democratic Party officials to provide a solution that aligns with the state law in a timely manner to the​ office of the secretary of state.\n\nA spokesperson for the Biden ‍campaign, in a statement to NBC News, said that they are “monitoring the situation in Ohio,” and expressed ​confidence‌ that‌ “Joe Biden will be on the ballot in all​ 50 states.”\n\nIt’s important⁣ to note that⁤ the Republican Party holds‍ the ⁢majority ⁤in both chambers of Ohio’s state Legislature, making it difficult ​to ⁣extend the deadline. Holding the convention earlier could also lead to logistical challenges. These factors could ⁢potentially result in Biden being left off the ‍2024 ballot⁣ in Ohio.\n\nAs reported‌ by the Associated Press, the state had⁢ temporarily altered the rules before the 2020 presidential election, when both the⁢ Republican‌ and Democratic conventions were scheduled after the state’s ​certification ⁢deadline. A similar adjustment was made in 2012.\n\nOhio has historically been a significant state ⁤in presidential elections. Since 1856, 34 out ⁢of 38 Republican presidential‌ candidates‌ who ⁣won Ohio’s support have gone ⁣on to win the presidency.\n\nThe saying ‍”As Ohio goes, so goes the nation” has been a popular⁣ adage, but this trend was broken in the‍ last election when Ohio favored former President Donald Trump‌ in 2016 and 2020,⁣ but ‍Trump lost the latter ⁤election.\n\nThe last time such a deviation occurred was in 1960 when Ohio chose Richard Nixon over the ​eventual ⁢winner, John F. Kennedy.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — A number of health advocacy organizations are urging the FDA to prohibit the use⁤ of a crucial chemical in the decaffeination process, citing potential cancer risks.\n\nThe chemical in​ question is methylene chloride, an odorless liquid utilized in various industrial procedures, such⁢ as paint stripping, pharmaceutical production, paint ⁤remover manufacturing, and metal cleaning and degreasing, as per the Occupational Safety and​ Health Administration.\n\nDr. Maria Doa, senior director of chemical policy for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the five groups and individuals who submitted two food and color additive petitions ‌to the FDA in November, stated that methylene chloride⁤ has long​ been recognized as a carcinogen by the National Institutes of Health’s National Toxicology Program, the Environmental Protection ‌Agency, and the⁢ World Health Organization.\n\nThe FDA began considering the ⁤petitions on Dec. 21 and accepted public comments on the filing notice until March 11.\n\nDr. ​Doa further explained via email‍ that, ⁤”In addition to being ⁤carcinogenic, methylene chloride can cause other health harms,‍ such as liver toxicity and ⁤at higher exposures neurological effects, and in some cases death.” These risks ‌are associated with acute external exposure to high levels of ‍the chemical⁣ or ingestion of the chemical⁣ on its own, ⁣according to the U.S. Centers for ‌Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nDue to the chemical’s toxicity, the EPA banned its sale as a paint stripper in 2019. In 2023,‌ the agency proposed a ban on its sale for other consumer⁣ uses and many industrial and commercial uses, Doa ⁢said. However, food‍ uses regulated by the ‍FDA under ⁣the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act remain.\n\nThe Environmental Defense Fund and ⁢its co-petitioners argue that the ⁢FDA, by⁢ allowing ‍methylene chloride in food, is “disregarding” a⁣ 66-year-old amendment to the federal act known as⁢ the Delaney Clause. This clause ⁤mandates the FDA to ban food additives proven ⁤to cause or induce cancer when ingested by humans or animals.\n\n“Thus, these chemicals categorically‌ cannot and should not‌ be deemed as safe,” Doa stated.\n\nAn FDA spokesperson said in⁣ a‍ statement that the FDA is currently reviewing the petitions but does not comment on them while they are under review.\n\nHere’s what experts and the FDA say about this clause in the modern context, and what you should know about the safety of decaf coffee.\n\nWhat we know about methylene chloride\n\nThe FDA has one regulation permitting the use of methylene chloride as a solvent to decaffeinate coffee, stipulating that “the residues of methylene chloride must not exceed 10 parts per million (0.001%) in decaffeinated roasted coffee and in decaffeinated soluble coffee extract (instant coffee).”\n\nAn FDA spokesperson said via email, “While methylene chloride may be indirectly involved in food processing, such as in the decaffeination of coffee beans, residue limits have been set to limit exposure.‍ Any ⁣food product that contains residues of⁣ methylene chloride above the established limits are not permitted for sale or‍ consumption.”\n\nWilliam ⁢Murray, President and CEO ​of the National Coffee Association,‌ argued that banning European Method decaf coffee — the type that uses methylene chloride — “would defy science and harm American’s⁣ health.”\n\n“There⁢ is no evidence that European⁣ Method ‍decaf presents any risk,” he added via ‍email. “Indeed, the overwhelming weight of independent‌ scientific evidence shows that drinking European Method⁢ decaf, like all coffee, is associated with decreased⁤ risk of multiple⁤ cancers and with other significant health benefits.”\n\nHowever, Doa countered that the FDA’s last decision ‌on the chemical’s use for coffee “is decades old and clearly outdated.”\n\n‘There still isn’t a‌ lot of clear or conclusive research’\n\nMonique Richard, a registered dietitian nutritionist ‍and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, ‍a private practice in Tennessee,⁢ noted that many people‍ today consume larger portions⁣ of beverages or food than the smaller⁢ standard sizes⁢ of decades ago.⁤ For instance, while a standard cup of coffee ​was once 5 or 8 ounces, the​ smallest size at your local coffee shop today is ⁣likely 12 ounces.\n\n“But there still isn’t a lot of clear or conclusive research that ingesting residual levels⁤ in coffee specifically⁤ will cause cancer or other problems,” said Richard, who wasn’t involved in the petitions.\n\nHowever, she added, “we certainly want to be⁢ obviously proactive and be aware of some of these things.”\n\nResearch on what the human body can ⁣handle in terms of⁤ toxic load is evolving. Scientists are learning more about genetic disposition and gene ​expression, which ‌can provide information about what​ cells can tolerate in terms ‌of an assault on‍ the ⁣body. “So it may be less about what’s actually in your coffee, but what other factors are affecting your body?” Richard asked. “Even a ⁤’minute’ amount could⁣ be significantly destructive on a cellular level, over time,” she added.\n\nWhile methylene chloride has long been commonly used in ⁤the decaf industry, some‌ companies have introduced alternative methods or stopped using it entirely.\n\nWhat⁣ you‌ can do now\n\nThe decision on whether or not the FDA will eventually ban methylene chloride could take years.\n\nHowever, if you want to avoid potential methylene chloride exposure, when buying decaf coffee, look for product packaging with labels such as solvent-free,‌ Swiss Water processed or⁣ certified organic, Doa advised.\n\n“As a consumer, always do your research,” ‍Richard suggested. “Look up what you​ can about the company. Ask those⁢ questions if you can get on a customer hotline on their website.”\n\nAlso‍ consider⁤ how often ‍you’re drinking decaf coffee, how much⁤ and why, she added.\n\n“If you’re concerned about that and you just are confused, there’s lots of substitutes that are caffeine-free,” Richard said. These include beverages made from chicory root, figs and barley, dandelion root, mushroom elixirs, cacao, ⁢rooibos and yerba maté.",

        "content": "HONOLULU ⁢— The ‌last remaining ​survivor of the USS Arizona, the naval warship ​that was‍ tragically⁣ sunk during the unexpected Japanese assault on Pearl Harbor, Lou Conter, has passed away at the age‍ of 102. The attack resulted in the loss of ⁣1,177 lives.\n\nConter spent his final moments surrounded by loved ones ‍at his residence in Grass Valley, California. His peaceful passing‌ on​ Monday was confirmed by Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam and Pacific Historic Parks, quoting Conter’s daughter, Louann Daley.\n\nConter dedicated his life to ensuring the public never ‌forgot the⁣ devastating⁢ bombing. Through interviews, a ⁢published book, and by attending memorial services, he kept the memory of the attack alive. The bombing had ‌catapulted the battleship 30-40 feet out of the water, leaving many survivors with severe injuries.\n\nAs a 20-year-old quartermaster, Conter ⁣played a ⁢crucial role⁢ in rescuing his fellow crewmen on the fateful morning of Dec.‌ 7, 1941. This‍ event⁢ marked ⁤the ‌U.S.’s ‌entry into World⁣ War II.\n\nIn⁤ his ‍autobiography, “The Lou Conter Story: From USS Arizona Survivor to Unsung American Hero,” Conter recounted the horrifying moment when​ a Japanese armor-piercing bomb hit one million pounds of ⁤gunpowder stored in ‍the ship’s hull. He was on the USS Arizona deck at ⁤the time.\n\nConter shared his harrowing experiences with CNN ​affiliate KCRA ⁣in an interview⁣ last year. “Guys were‌ coming out of⁤ the fire, and we were just grabbing them and laying them down,” he said. “They were real bad. You​ would pick them ⁣up by the bodies,‍ and the skin would come off your hands.”\n\nThe attack lasted for an hour and 15 minutes, claiming the lives of approximately 2,400 US service members​ and civilians, and injuring over 1,100 people, as per a National WWII Museum‌ facts report ‍and other sources.\n\nConter was one of the 335 Arizona crew⁤ members who survived the attack. He outlived them all, including Ken Potts, the second to the‍ last⁤ survivor, ​who passed away last ⁤year ‍in Provo, at age 102, as‌ reported by‌ Pacific Historic Parks, which supports the USS Arizona Memorial and other ⁣sites.\n\nAileen Utterdyke, president and CEO of⁤ Pacific Historic Parks, expressed her sorrow over ⁣Conter’s passing.⁢ “This is a heartbreaking loss,” she said. “Lou Conter embodied the spirit⁤ of the Greatest Generation, a group of Americans ⁤whose collective bravery, achievements, and sacrifices ⁢saved our nation from ‍oppression.”\n\nUtterdyke praised Conter’s distinguished Navy career and his commitment to reminding schools, parents, and everyday Americans to always remember ‍Pearl Harbor. Funeral arrangements for the veteran are currently pending, the organization said.\n\nFollowing the Pearl​ Harbor attack, Conter’s military service​ expanded, and he became a VP-11 Black Cat pilot, as stated ‍by Pacific Historic Parks. The Black Cats conducted‌ operations under the cover of ⁢darkness, ⁢hidden from enemy ships.\n\nConter flew⁤ several ⁤missions with the Black Cats and survived two shootdowns during World War II, including one off the coast of ⁢New Guinea where‍ the crew was⁣ surrounded by sharks, according to ​Pacific Historic Parks.\n\nAfter World War II, Conter​ transitioned into an intelligence officer role, flying combat missions in Korea. He was highly respected in the military ⁤intelligence ‍community and was ‍instrumental in creating the Navy’s‍ first survival, evasion, resistance, and escape program, according to the National WWII ​Museum in New Orleans.\n\nConter also served as a⁤ military adviser to Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, and Lyndon B. Johnson, as reported by Pacific Historic Parks.\n\nAfter 28 years of dedicated service, Conter retired in​ December 1967, according to the National WWII Museum.\n\nWhen Conter turned 100, he pinned the pilot ⁢wings he’d earned in⁢ World War II on his 29-year-old great-nephew, U.S. Marine Capt. Ray Daniel Hower.‍ Although Conter was unable⁤ to attend the​ ceremony, Hower⁢ acknowledged in his keynote speech ⁤that the freedom, opportunity, and prosperity we enjoy today would ⁢not be possible without Conter’s service and heroism.\n\nConter was born in northern Wisconsin in 1921 and was the middle child ⁣in his family, according to the National WWII Museum. Conter and his family lived⁢ in New Mexico, ⁤Denver, and⁢ Kansas. He enlisted in the Navy just after‌ his 18th birthday.\n\nDespite his ‌heroic actions, Conter remained humble. “They call a lot of us⁢ heroes, and I’ve always said ⁣we are not the heroes,” Conter told‌ KCRA last year. “Heroes are the ones right there that​ day that ​lost their lives. They gave⁣ everything up. We ‌got​ back‍ to⁤ the‌ States. We got​ married. We had ‍kids and grandkids.⁤ We are still here. They were‍ lost ⁢forever right then and there.”",

However, the ⁤numbers remain alarmingly higher ⁣than those recorded before the pandemic.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic‌ Safety ‍Administration (NHTSA) reported an ‍estimated 40,990 traffic-related ​deaths in 2023, a​ drop from 42,514 ‌fatalities⁢ in 2022. Despite this decrease, the figure is still significantly higher than the 36,355 deaths‌ recorded in 2019, a year that marked the third consecutive annual decline⁣ in traffic deaths.\n\nThe fatality⁤ rate in 2023 surpassed any pre-pandemic year since 2008. Interestingly, the total miles driven ⁢in 2023 exceeded pre-pandemic levels for the first time.\n\nExperts suggest that the perceived ⁤decrease in ‌traffic policing during the COVID-19 pandemic may have led ⁢to riskier driving behaviors. As roads became⁤ less congested, some drivers may have felt less likely to receive traffic citations, leading to an increase​ in reckless driving.\n\nIn 2021, U.S. traffic fatalities ⁢saw a shocking 10.5% increase, reaching 42,915 – the highest number of deaths on American⁣ roads in a single ​year since 2005.\n\nThe NHTSA also reported a slight increase ⁤in pedestrian fatalities in 2022, with a 0.7% ⁤rise ‌to 7,522 – the highest number since 1981.

        "content": "WASHINGTON — ⁣In a significant shift, the Social Security Administration has ‌announced that ⁤recipients who have been overpaid‍ will now be required ​to repay a significantly smaller portion of the excess amount.\n\nOn Friday, the Social Security Administration declared a change in its⁣ policy. Instead⁤ of automatically deducting 100% of the overpayment from⁢ the monthly benefits of recipients, ​the agency will now only collect 10% — or ‌$10, whichever is higher — to recover the overpayment.\n\nExceptions to this rule will be few and far between, ‌and will primarily apply in ​cases where the overpayment was a result of⁢ fraudulent activities.\n\n“We​ are taking a crucial step towards achieving ​our objective of ensuring that our overpayment policies are​ just, balanced, ​and do not ⁤cause undue hardship to anyone,” stated Social Security Commissioner Martin O’Malley. “It’s unthinkable that someone could face homelessness or be unable to pay their bills because Social⁤ Security withheld their​ entire payment to recover an overpayment.”\n\nThis policy change⁣ will apply to new overpayments. However, those who are currently having more⁤ than‌ 10% of their benefits withheld can reach⁢ out to the⁤ Social Security Administration to discuss the possibility of reducing the rate.\n\nBeneficiaries who wish to have a rate lower than 10% will be approved if the overpayment can be recovered within 60 months. This ‌is a significant extension from the previous deadline​ of‍ 36 months.\n\nThe Social Security Administration has recently faced criticism for mistakenly overpaying beneficiaries and then aggressively ‍reclaiming the funds. This issue has​ been⁢ highlighted by several media outlets and was the subject of a hearing by a House Ways and Means subcommittee last ⁢fall.\n\n“Improper payments,⁢ many of which ‌are not⁤ the fault of the recipients, do indeed impose a ⁤heavy burden on them,” stated Georgia Rep. Drew Ferguson, the Republican chairman of ⁣the subcommittee, in his‍ opening remarks at the hearing. “That’s why we need to do more⁤ to prevent these situations from occurring in⁢ the first place.”\n\nAccording to a report by the Government Accountability ‌Office,‌ the ​majority of recipients who receive Social Security disability benefits and have ⁢sufficient earnings to affect their benefits receive an overpayment. The report, which cited a 2019 study by the Social Security Administration and Mathematica, a research and consulting firm, found that‌ overpayments ⁢typically lasted‍ nine months and ⁣amounted to‌ nearly $9,300.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, the Social⁣ Security Administration made monthly payments to an average of approximately 72‌ million people, as per the ‍agency’s latest financial report. ​The agency distributed more than $1.4 trillion in benefits during this period.\n\nOut‌ of the $1.3 trillion it paid to senior​ citizens, ‍survivors, and people with disabilities in the fiscal year 2022, the agency estimated that $6.5 billion were overpayments, representing about 0.5% of the total. ​It also estimated that $4.6 billion, or 8%, of the $57.6⁤ billion⁣ it paid ⁣in Supplemental‌ Security Income to low-income senior citizens and people with ‌disabilities that year were overpayments.\n\nIn ⁢the fiscal year 2023, the Social Security Administration recovered more than $4.9 billion in overpayments but ended the year with a total ‍balance ​of $23 billion in uncollected payments.\n\nAn independent auditor’s report by Ernst & Young in the fiscal ​year 2023 identified a ​”significant deficiency in internal control” ‌regarding overpayments. This included ⁢”deficiencies” in documenting and calculating benefit overpayment and in maintaining records ⁢and tracking long-term installment ⁢payments.\n\nIn response to these issues, then-Acting Commissioner Kilolo Kijakazi initiated a review of the⁤ agency’s overpayment procedures and policies in October.",

The⁤ discussion revolved around the effects of DEI initiatives on ⁢medical institutions and the ⁤issue ⁣of ‍antisemitism in universities.\n\nIn his ​introductory remarks, Owens expressed ⁢his belief that these initiatives foster a ⁣”distorted perspective” of America, portraying the nation as “a hierarchy built on racial oppressors and the racially oppressed.”\n\nThis congressional hearing follows closely‍ on the heels​ of the Utah Legislature’s decision to revamp DEI initiatives‌ in public institutions, ‌encompassing universities, schools, and other ⁢state entities.\n\nThe newly enacted‌ law, ‌signed by Utah Gov. Spencer ⁢Cox on Jan. 30, mandates training for university employees on the importance of free speech and the conduction of climate surveys, ⁤the findings of which must ‌be disclosed to lawmakers. The state ‍reserves the⁤ right to withhold funding if institutions fail to comply with these requirements.\n\nAt the congressional hearing in Washington, Owens, who represents Utah’s ⁤4th District, ⁤stated, “DEI bureaucrats are employed not merely to regulate conversations but also to suppress free speech and ⁤open dialogue by exerting influence over every aspect of university administration, personnel, curriculum policy,‍ and college admissions.”\n\nPartisan Disagreement‌ over the Purpose of the Program\n\nOwens argued that these programs encourage ‌Black Americans to⁢ view their race as “feeble” and to “anticipate the promise of slavery reparations.” He further stated that DEI initiatives⁣ suggest that Black Americans, like himself, who demonstrate the determination and resilience to succeed, ⁢are outliers rather than the norm.\n\n“DEI is both belittling and racist,” Owens declared, citing ‌the silencing of scholars who ⁢dare to challenge it.\n\nOwens highlighted the⁣ financial burden‌ of DEI initiatives across the nation: $30 million annually at the University ‌of Michigan, $20‍ million at ‍Ohio State, $16 million at the University of Western Wisconsin, ⁢and $11 million‍ at Texas A&M.\n\n“What is the outcome?” Owens queried. “More hatred?​ More resentment? ‍And more racism?“\n\nRanking chairwoman Suzanne Bonamici, a ‌Democrat from Oregon, countered⁤ Owens’ ‌comparison of DEI initiatives to cancer, which she found “perplexing and quite offensive to anyone who has battled cancer.” In response, Owens, ⁤a cancer survivor himself, stood by his initial statement.\n\nBonamici argued that DEI offices strive to provide support and identify obstacles in ‍the education system​ to cater ⁣to “the needs of increasingly diverse populations, many of whom are first-generation college students.”\n\n“Unfortunately, some Republican-led state ⁣legislatures have‌ deemed DEI offices as too expensive,” she noted.\n\nBonamici‌ suggested that universities where DEI initiatives are falling short should be encouraged to‍ improve, ⁤rather than ​being outrightly ​condemned.\n\nThe Influence of DEI⁣ Initiatives in Medical Schools\n\nPrior ⁢to questioning​ the witnesses, Owens‌ mentioned an article he read about ​Columbia University facing criticism for a ‌2021 viral video in which students recited ‌a modified version of the ​Hippocratic oath during a white coat ceremony.\n\nThe altered oath included ‍phrases such as​ “We also acknowledge the ​acts​ and systems​ of⁢ oppression perpetrated in the ​name of⁢ medicine,” and‍ “We take this oath of service to commence ⁢building a⁢ future rooted in truth, restoration, and equity to realize​ medicine’s potential to liberate.”\n\nOwens asked ⁣witness Dr. Stanley Goldfarb, the chairman of Do No Harm, a ‍medical association opposing liberal ideology, whether the original oath mentions “systems⁤ of oppression in medicine.” Goldfard confirmed that ⁣the​ original ​oath did⁣ not ‍contain​ any such statements. When Owens inquired whether the purpose of medicine is to liberate, Goldfard, once again, responded with a “no.”\n\n“Doctors must retain a wealth ⁤of information, sift through it, comprehend human variability, and apply it to individual patients,” Goldfard‌ explained. “That’s why I firmly‍ believe that academic‌ achievement should be⁢ the primary criterion ‌for admission into⁢ medical school.”\n\n“I ‌think⁣ we can all agree ⁤that ​this‍ is one profession where meritocracy should be the primary focus,” Owens concurred.\n\nDEI Initiatives and Antisemitism in Universities\n\nOwens then directed his next​ question to Jay Greene, a⁢ senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation’s⁢ Center ⁣for⁢ Education Policy, about the impact of⁢ DEI initiatives ​on the Jewish community.\n\nIn his ​opening statement, ⁣Greene stated that instances of antisemitism⁣ in universities are not ‌isolated incidents. In his analysis of X accounts of university DEI staff, ⁣Greene‌ found evidence of “vehement hostility toward” ⁢Israel. He noted that these staff members posted “three⁤ times as often about ‌Israel as they⁢ do about China.” The language used to express this animosity includes terms like “apartheid, colonialism, genocide, and ethnic ‌cleansing.”\n\nOwens then turned to witness Erec Smith, an associate professor of rhetoric​ at York College of Pennsylvania ​and a CATO research fellow, asking him to elaborate on his statements about DEI initiatives being “subtly anti-Black,” ⁢and how he was labeled a “white supremacist” for opposing these initiatives as a Black ‌academic.\n\nIn his opening statement, Smith⁢ mentioned prescriptive ⁢racism, which assigns “certain values, attitudes, and behaviors to someone based on ⁢their race,” as a component of‌ social justice reform.\n\nHe cited instances of professors allowing and encouraging Black students to write in African American vernacular, also known as ‌Ebonics. When students refused to abandon standardized English, these professors perceived⁤ it “as a ⁣form of self-hatred ​and internalized racism,” Smith explained.\n\n“Teaching standardized English is not⁢ inherently racist,” he assured Owens.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — In his ‍State of​ the Union⁤ address on Thursday night, President Joe ​Biden passionately made ‍his case for ⁣a second term. He took aim at ‍GOP front-runner Donald Trump, accusing him of promoting “resentment, revenge and retribution” and endangering freedom both domestically and internationally.\n\nBiden⁤ repeatedly criticized “my predecessor” without‍ directly naming former President Trump. He ​raised his voice to address voter concerns​ about his age and job ‌performance, while‍ drawing a stark contrast with his likely opponent in⁣ the November election.\n\nThe tone of Biden’s speech was noticeably more combative than his ⁣previous State⁣ of the‌ Union address. He seemed to relish the opportunity ‍to challenge Republicans on their policies, engage in lively exchanges‍ with fellow Democrats, and dispel any ​doubts ⁤about his ability to ⁢serve a second term​ at the age of ⁣81.\n\n“Freedom and democracy ‌are under attack both at home and overseas ⁢at ⁤the very same time,” Biden declared, urging Congress to support Ukraine’s efforts to resist Russia’s ⁢invasion. “History⁢ is watching.”\n\nBiden swiftly shifted his focus to domestic threats, referencing the Jan. 6, ‍2021, attack‌ on ‍the Capitol by⁢ Trump⁤ supporters attempting ⁤to overturn the 2020 election. He called for a ‌robust response to this threat to democracy.\n\n“My predecessor — ‌and some of⁤ you here​ —⁢ seek to bury the truth about Jan. 6 — I⁤ will not do that,” Biden stated. “This is a moment to speak the truth ‍and ⁣to bury the lies. Here’s a simple truth. You⁢ can’t love your country only when you win.”\n\n“My lifetime has taught me to embrace ​freedom and democracy,”‌ Biden continued. “A ⁣future based on the ⁣core values ⁣that have defined‌ America: honesty, decency, dignity, equality. ​To respect everyone. To give everyone ‌a fair⁢ shot. To give hate no safe harbor. Now some other people my age see⁤ a different ⁢story:⁤ an American story ⁣of resentment, revenge, and retribution. That’s not me.”\n\nThe president highlighted his achievements⁤ in infrastructure and manufacturing, and urged⁤ Congress​ to approve additional aid to Ukraine, ‍stricter ‍immigration laws, and lower drug prices. He also reminded voters of⁣ the challenging circumstances he faced when he took ‍office in 2021, in ⁣the ‍midst of‍ a pandemic ⁣and a shrinking economy.\n\n‘Just let⁤ me ⁣know’\n\nObservers were keen to ‌see not only what ⁣the⁣ 81-year-old president had to⁣ say, but⁣ also how energetically and confidently he could deliver his message.\n\nWhite House aides revealed that Biden was determined to prove his critics⁤ wrong by showing his ​fighting spirit⁢ and challenging Republicans ‍on issues he believes they are out ⁤of touch‍ with the country on, such as access to abortion, tax ​policy, ‌and ⁢health care. This is part of his election-year strategy to use even official speeches to ‍clarify the choice for voters in the upcoming election.\n\nAs ‍he celebrated his legislative achievements, such as a law that strengthens the manufacturing of computer ⁢chips nationwide, Biden deviated from ⁤his prepared remarks to​ take⁤ a⁣ jab at ‍Republicans who voted against such policies‍ but are quick ‌to claim credit⁣ for them‍ in their ⁢home districts.\n\n“If any of you ⁣don’t want that money in‌ your districts,” Biden said, “just let me know.”\n\nThe president was speaking to a historically ineffective Congress. In the‍ GOP-led House, Speaker Mike ⁤Johnson assumed power five months ago following ⁤the ⁤tumultuous ​removal of former Speaker Kevin⁣ McCarthy. Lawmakers are still struggling to pass funding bills ⁣for the ‌current ‌year⁢ and have been at a stalemate for months ⁢on foreign aid⁣ bills to assist Ukraine ⁢in resisting Russia’s invasion and support Israel’s ⁢fight against Hamas.\n\nThe​ State ‌of the Union address is⁤ a ⁣high-profile event on the White House calendar, providing presidents with a⁣ direct line to a captive audience of lawmakers and​ dignitaries in the House chamber and tens of millions of viewers⁣ at home. However, viewership has‍ been⁢ declining in ​recent years.\n\nWhite House and campaign aides for Biden ⁤were hoping for some new viral moments — like last year⁢ when he clashed ‌with heckling Republicans and criticized‌ them for past​ attempts to cut Medicare and Social Security.\n\nJohnson, keen ⁣to avoid a ‌similar‌ incident this year, encouraged Republicans in a private meeting​ on Wednesday to show “decorum” during the speech, according to a person ⁤familiar with his comments​ to lawmakers.\n\nHis advice had limited success. Several House Republicans began ⁢to stand up and leave the chamber as Biden discussed raising taxes ⁤on billionaires and corporations.​ Others,⁢ like Johnson, remained seated and shook their‍ heads.\n\n‘I know you know how to read’\n\nBiden‍ engaged in a spirited exchange ⁤with lawmakers as he rhetorically ⁢questioned⁣ the fairness‌ of the tax code and whether billionaires and corporations need “another $2 trillion in tax ⁢breaks,” as he ​claimed ⁢Republicans ⁢want.\n\nOne of the most heated⁢ moments of⁣ his speech occurred ‍during his comments on immigration, when Biden​ was ⁢listing ‍the ⁤endorsements by conservative⁢ groups of the bipartisan border legislation that Republicans killed last month.\n\nSome in the audience​ seemed to‌ shout and interrupt, and⁣ Biden retorted,‍ “I know you ⁤know how to read.”\n\nAs Rep.⁣ Marjorie Taylor Greene, adorned in pro-Trump gear, continued to yell​ at Biden, the president held up a white button that the‍ Georgia Republican‌ had given him earlier bearing the name ‍of Laken Riley, who⁢ authorities say⁢ was ‌killed by a Venezuelan national who illegally crossed into the⁣ U.S. in September 2022.\n\n“Laken Riley,” Biden said, referring⁣ to‌ her as an “innocent young woman who ​was killed ‍by an illegal.” He expressed his condolences to her⁢ family, saying his heart goes out to them.\n\nMeanwhile, congressional Republican leaders were highlighting one of their​ newest lawmakers ‍through the State‍ of the Union rebuttal in an attempt to draw a generational contrast with Biden. Alabama‍ Sen. Katie Britt, the youngest Republican woman elected to the Senate,⁤ planned to depict a nation that “seems to‍ be ⁤slipping away” and one where “our families are hurting.”\n\n“Right now, our commander-in-chief is not in ​command.‍ The free⁢ world deserves better than a⁣ dithering⁣ and diminished leader,”⁤ Britt was ⁤expected to say, ⁣according to excerpts released Thursday⁣ evening. ​”America ‌deserves leaders who recognize that secure borders, ⁢stable prices, safe streets, and a ⁢strong defense are ‌the cornerstones of⁢ a great nation.”\n\nBiden ​painted a hopeful picture of the country’s future as the major pieces ‍of legislation he‍ signed into law during​ his first two years in office are implemented. ‍But he also warned that the progress ⁤he sees at home and⁢ abroad is fragile — and particularly vulnerable if Trump ‍returns to ​the White House.\n\nTrump, for his ⁣part, ⁣said he planned ​to respond in real-time ⁤to Biden’s remarks on his Truth Social platform.\n\nUkraine and Gaza\n\nThis year, Biden faced heightened ⁢emotions — particularly among his ⁣base supporters — over his staunch backing​ for Israel’s war against Hamas ⁣in Gaza. The White House ⁢had initially hoped a short-term cease-fire‌ would be in place by the speech. It blames Hamas for not yet accepting a deal brokered by the⁢ U.S.‌ and its allies.\n\nA number of Democrats and Republicans⁢ wore pins ​and stickers in ⁣honor of ⁤the Israeli ⁣hostages​ still being ​held captive in Gaza. Meanwhile,​ several House progressives wore Palestinian⁣ keffiyehs, the black and white checkered ⁣scarfs that have come to symbolize Palestinian solidarity. Biden’s‌ motorcade took a circuitous route to the Capitol, as ​hundreds of pro-cease-fire demonstrators tried⁢ to disrupt its‌ path from the White House.\n\nAmid growing concerns about the⁣ dire⁢ humanitarian situation in Gaza, Biden announced in his address that‌ he has ​directed the U.S. military to‌ establish a temporary port ‍on the Gaza coast aimed at increasing the flow of aid into the beleaguered territory.\n\nThe president also⁣ issued a strong call for lawmakers to ​pass urgently needed defense assistance for ‌Ukraine. Acute ammunition shortages have allowed Russia to retake the offensive⁤ in⁢ the 2-year-old war.\n\nThe GOP-controlled House has refused to act⁣ on a Senate-passed ‍version ‍of the aid legislation, insisting on new stricter measures to limit migration at the U.S.-Mexico border, after ⁤Trump⁤ used his influence to help sink a bipartisan compromise that supporters ‍say would have done just that.\n\n‘The law of the​ land’\n\nAccess to abortion and fertility‍ treatments was ‌also a key component of Biden’s speech, especially in‌ light‌ of a controversial ruling⁣ from⁣ Alabama’s⁤ Supreme Court that⁣ has disrupted access‌ to in vitro ​fertilization treatment in the state.\n\nOne of first lady Jill Biden’s guests⁢ for the speech was Kate Cox, who sued Texas, and ultimately left her home state, to obtain an emergency abortion after⁢ a severe fetal anomaly was detected.\n\n“If Americans send me ⁣a Congress that supports ⁤the right to choose I promise you: I will restore Roe⁤ v. Wade as the law of the land again,” Biden said. Several House Democratic women were‍ wearing white — a symbol of⁣ women’s​ suffrage — to promote reproductive ‍rights.\n\nThe⁢ White House also invited⁣ union leaders, a gun control advocate and others ​that Jill Biden and her husband have met as⁤ they traveled the country promoting‍ his​ agenda.‌ The‌ prime minister of Sweden, Ulf Kristersson, ​will attend to mark his‍ country’s accession to NATO in the wake of Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nExpelled and ⁢disgraced, former⁢ Rep. George Santos, who still retains floor privileges as an ex-member of Congress,​ also showed up ‌for the speech.\n\n‘Shrinkflation’\n\nHeading into⁢ the State of⁤ the Union, Biden also addressed the issues ‍of “shrinkflation”‌ — companies putting fewer pretzels in the jar and less yogurt in sealed cups — and so-called “junk fees” on services. While⁤ neither ​is a main⁤ driver of inflation,‌ the White House hopes to​ show consumers ⁢that Biden​ is fighting for them.\n\nBiden also⁣ unveiled an ⁣expanded plan to⁢ raise​ corporate taxes⁤ and use the proceeds to reduce budget deficits and cut taxes for the middle class.\n\nBiden entered the speech with work to do to improve ‌his standing.⁤ Just 38% ⁣of U.S. ‌adults approve of how he is handling his job as president, while 61% disapprove, ‌according ⁢to a recent ‌survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nThe ⁢same survey​ found that more than 6 in 10 (63%) say they’re not very or not at all confident in Biden’s mental‍ capability to serve effectively as‍ president. A similar but slightly smaller share (57%) say that Trump ‌lacks‌ the memory ⁢and acuity⁤ for the job.\n\nThe already intense scrutiny ⁤of⁢ Biden’s age was magnified when special counsel Robert Hur raised questions about the ⁤president’s mental acuity in his⁤ report last month on Biden’s handling of classified information. Hur is set to testify⁤ Tuesday before lawmakers about his investigation.\n\nAfter the speech, Biden ‍was scheduled for⁣ a weekend of campaign travel, holding events in Pennsylvania ‌on⁣ Friday and Georgia on ⁤Saturday.‍ Trump, ⁣too, will be ⁤campaigning in Georgia that day. The ⁤president’s Cabinet also ⁢will fan out across the country to ​amplify his message.\n\nThe Biden campaign said it would host more ‍than 200 watch parties around the country Thursday night, including in cities, suburbs‍ and rural towns in battleground states. Campaign officials will use the events to recruit ⁣volunteers ‍and⁣ encourage others to ⁣get involved in Biden’s reelection effort.\n\nrnrn",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — In a surprising turn of events, President Joe Biden, who was‌ dominating every​ Democratic contest on Super Tuesday, stumbled in American Samoa.\n\nUnexpectedly, a relatively‍ unknown candidate named Jason⁢ Palmer⁣ outperformed Biden⁣ in the territory’s caucus. ⁤With a total of 91 votes‍ cast, Palmer secured ⁣51, ‍leaving Biden trailing with 40, as reported by the local party.\n\n“The news of my ⁢victory reached me through a flurry⁢ of ​texts from friends and campaign staff,” ‌Palmer shared in​ a late-night interview on Tuesday.\n\nAt 52, ⁢Palmer confessed that he had never set foot in the territory‍ before the caucus. “My campaign ⁢was conducted remotely.

The U.S. territory, a​ small cluster of islands in the South‌ Pacific‍ with a population‌ of less than 50,000, had only six delegates up‍ for grabs. Both Palmer and Biden ⁢walked away with ⁢three delegates each.\n\nOn the eve ⁢of the caucus, Palmer took ⁤to the social platform X, previously ‌known as Twitter, to‌ express his ‍advocacy for American Samoa. “Washington D.C. is long overdue for ⁣a president who will be an advocate⁤ for American Samoa,” he​ posted.

        "content": "WASHINGTON —​ In a surprising turn of events, ⁣Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who once criticized ‍Donald Trump for his role in the⁣ Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol ⁣attack, ⁤has now‌ endorsed the former president’s bid for a return to the White​ House.\n\nMcConnell, the last⁣ top⁢ GOP leader in Congress ⁣to⁢ align with Trump, announced his support following Trump’s victories on Super Tuesday, which brought him closer to securing the party’s nomination.\n\nThe two men had not been ⁣in direct communication since 2020‌ when McConnell acknowledged Democrat Joe Biden‍ as the victor ⁤of the presidential election. However, their teams⁤ have recently resumed discussions regarding an ⁢endorsement.\n\n“The support‍ that former President ⁤Trump has‌ garnered from Republican ⁢voters clearly ‌indicates that he is our party’s preferred nominee for President of the United States,”⁤ McConnell stated.\n\nMcConnell added, “As the‍ nominee, he will naturally have my support.”\n\nMcConnell’s endorsement, ⁢despite‍ his previous criticism of Trump as “morally ‌responsible” for the 2021​ Capitol‌ attack, ⁣lends a sense​ of institutional legitimacy to the former president’s campaign to reclaim the White House.\n\nThis endorsement ⁣comes on the ‍heels of McConnell’s recent⁤ announcement that​ he will not‍ seek re-election as leader after this term, a position he ⁢has held longer ‌than any other senator. His‍ focus now is ⁣on regaining Republican control of the Senate, with Trump likely leading ⁤the GOP ticket.\n\nTrump can now count on the support of GOP⁣ leaders in Congress, including Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Republicans hoping to succeed​ McConnell as leader, ‍in‌ his bid‍ for​ the presidency.\n\nMcConnell highlighted the ⁤accomplishments achieved ⁣during their previous collaboration,‌ stating, “Trump and‌ I worked together to achieve significant results ‍for‍ the American people.”\n\nDespite⁢ their past differences, McConnell’s endorsement of Trump signifies a political reunion, with both men prioritizing their political interests over personal‌ grievances.\n\nRelated:\nTrump secures support from Utah Republicans after a tumultuous Super Tuesday caucus night\n\nTrump has publicly criticized McConnell in the past, referring to him ⁣as an “Old Crow”. He also made racially offensive remarks about‍ McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, who served as ⁣Trump’s Transportation⁤ Secretary and resigned following the Jan. 6 ‍attack​ — an event McConnell referred to as an insurrection.\n\nMcConnell’s​ endorsement of ​Trump signals to⁢ other hesitant Republicans — and the wealthy donors ​who fund campaigns⁣ —⁣ that it’s time to rally behind Trump, despite⁢ any lingering doubts about​ a‍ return to⁣ the Trump ‍era.\n\nFollowing the Jan. 6 attack on ​the ​Capitol, ​McConnell strongly condemned Trump’s actions, blaming the defeated president for spreading unfounded claims of a rigged election.\n\nAlthough McConnell did not vote to ⁣convict Trump in the Senate trial on House impeachment charges of inciting​ the Capitol insurrection, he cautioned that Trump could still face⁣ civil or criminal‍ prosecution after leaving the‍ White House.\n\n“He hasn’t escaped anything yet,” McConnell ​stated ⁢in the​ Senate at the time.\n\n“Our ‍country has a criminal justice ⁤system. ‌We have civil litigation, and former​ presidents are‌ not exempt from being held accountable by either,” he added.\n\nTrump has been indicted on federal charges ‍of conspiracy to ‍defraud Americans and obstruct an ⁤official proceeding in his attempts to overturn⁢ Biden’s​ victory and ‌the Jan. 6 attack. However, he has claimed immunity, a challenge ⁢that ‌is currently before the Supreme Court.\n\nDespite his reservations about Trump’s conduct during his presidency, McConnell seems willing⁤ to⁣ overlook these issues in light‍ of the ⁤achievements made⁤ during⁢ Trump’s term.\n\nTrump enacted a GOP tax⁢ cuts package and, with McConnell at the helm of ‌the Senate, was able to secure the confirmation of ⁣three Supreme⁣ Court justices.

This is because it is the first temple to be completed after the Church of Jesus Christ was founded in 1830.

The ownership​ of the temple, which was initially with Joseph ⁣Smith, became unclear after his⁢ murder in 1844. The Community of ‌Christ, formerly known as the⁢ Reorganized Church of⁢ Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, had been ​the primary caretaker of‍ the temple for over 140​ years.\n\nThe two churches have ⁤been ‌working⁣ on the transfer of ownership since 2021, according to the joint statement. They have​ a respectful relationship, and the Community ⁣of Christ had previously sold historic sites‍ in Missouri‍ and Ohio to the⁤ Church of Jesus Christ ⁤in 2012 and the ​printer’s manuscript‍ of the Book of Mormon in 2017.\n\nThe recent transfer of⁣ historic ‍sites and ‌documents includes numerous items and buildings, such as church history sites in ‌Nauvoo, Illinois. These include significant buildings within ⁢church ‍history,​ like ​the Red Brick Store, where the⁢ Relief ⁣Society, ​the church’s global women’s organization, was ‍first⁢ organized. Other​ sites include⁣ the‍ Joseph and Emma ⁤Smith Mansion ‍House, the Nauvoo⁤ House,‌ and the Smith Family Homestead.\n\nAlso included in the⁢ sale was the Bible used in the Joseph Smith translation of the Bible, the original door of⁢ Liberty Jail, and many other items and manuscripts. The purchase ‌price of the historic sites and⁣ documents was $192.5 million, as per a ⁤Q&A released on the church’s ‍Newsroom‍ website.\n\nThe ​Kirtland Temple is ⁤the centerpiece of this ⁣transaction. It⁤ was nominated as a National⁢ Historic Landmark in 1969 and officially designated⁢ as one in 1976. But its significance‍ extends beyond its historical importance to both churches.⁢ The temple is considered sacred due to what ‌one Latter-day Saint leader referred to as “the great​ pentecostal outpouring that Joseph ⁢and the Saints received ​in Kirtland.”\n\nAs the late church President Gordon ​B. Hinckley said in 2003, “There is something unique and​ wonderful about what happened here. Nothing like it has occurred anywhere else‍ in the history of the church, either before or since.”\n\nJoseph Smith reported that the spiritual priesthood keys‍ to operating Christ’s ancient ⁤church were ⁣restored by three angelic visitors at the Kirtland ‍Temple — Moses, Elias, and Elijah. They restored the power to seal families together forever, a cornerstone of the Latter-day Saint faith. Today, the church operates⁢ 188 temples worldwide and has plans to build 147 more.\n\nThe Reorganized Church, which became ⁣the Community of Christ in 2001, obtained the ‌Kirtland ⁢Temple through Joseph Smith’s son. Joseph Smith III bought the temple through a ⁢quit-claim deed in 1874. He⁢ gave the‍ property to the Reorganized Church⁣ in 1880, and the title was finalized in 1901.\n\nBefore Joseph Smith and the Latter-day Saints⁢ left Kirtland, the ⁤Kirtland Temple served as much as a meetinghouse as a⁢ temple. Church members used it for Sunday worship services, Thursday⁢ prayer‍ and fasting meetings, regular school, and a church choir.\n\nToday, Latter-day Saint⁤ temples open‍ to the public briefly after new construction or renovations, then are dedicated for the purpose of performing ⁣temple ordinances carried out by Latter-day Saints with active temple recommends. The Community of​ Christ has used the Kirtland Temple for various meetings and⁤ has opened it to ​the public for tours. The⁢ Church of Jesus Christ announced​ that the Kirtland Temple will remain a historic building ‍open to the public.\n\nThe church ​plans to reopen the temple for free⁣ public tours on⁣ March 25. The Community ‍of⁢ Christ will be given⁢ special access to use the Kirtland Temple for ‌some meetings.\n\nThe Church of ‍Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a fully functioning temple in Columbus, Ohio, and a second temple in​ the state, in Cleveland, is under⁣ construction.\n\nCommunity of Christ President ‍Stephen M. Veazey said the ⁢funds from the sale⁤ will ⁤bolster the endowments used to pay ⁤for ⁤many⁢ of the church’s missions.\n\nFor a virtual tour of the Kirtland Temple, click⁣ here.\n\nFull joint churches statement\n\nToday, Tuesday, March 5, 2024, the responsibility‌ and⁢ ownership for the Kirtland Temple, several historic buildings in Nauvoo, and various manuscripts⁣ and artifacts officially transferred from Community of Christ to The Church of ⁤Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for an agreed-upon amount. Together, ⁣we share an interest in and reverence ‍for these historic sites ‌and items and are committed to‍ preserving them for future generations.\n\nDiscussions⁣ leading to this landmark agreement commenced in June 2021.‍ “This ⁣exchange of assets ‌is significant for our church,’ said Stephen M. Veazey, president of Community ⁣of Christ. ‘Through funding ‍from increased endowments, Community of Christ ‍will have greater⁣ capacity to pursue our mission priorities around the ⁤world, including continuing to ‍fulfill the divinely envisioned purposes for our temple in Independence, Missouri.’\n\n“We are deeply honored ​to assume the stewardship​ of these sacred‌ places, documents, and artifacts,” said Russell M. Nelson, president of The Church‌ of Jesus‍ Christ⁣ of Latter-day Saints. “We thank our friends ‌at⁣ Community of Christ for their great care and cooperation in preserving these historical treasures thus far. We are committed‌ to doing ‌the ​same.”\n\nThe ​Kirtland Temple will remain an historic building. The Church of⁤ Jesus⁤ Christ of Latter-day‍ Saints plans to reopen it March 25, 2024, for public tours at no charge. Likewise, in​ Nauvoo,⁣ the Smith Family Homestead, the ‍Mansion House and the Red Brick‌ Store will also⁤ reopen on March 25, 2024, for year-round public tours ‌at no charge. More details about the transaction, assets, and ‌the other items included in the agreement will be forthcoming.\n\nThe ‌historic transfer underscores our long-standing effort to preserve religious and cultural heritage and ‍foster‍ respective opportunities for growth and service to ⁤the world.\n\nCommunity of⁤ Christ ‍is an‌ international faith community dedicated to fostering ⁤authentic connections with one ​another and ‌with God. It strives to restore Christ’s ​peace on Earth and challenge unjust systems that ‌diminish human worth. Community of Christ affirms the intrinsic worth of‌ every‍ person​ and provides⁢ a place to belong, be loved and valued, grow spiritually, and discover⁢ a purpose that can change lives⁤ and communities.\n\nThe Church ‍of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a worldwide faith, teaches​ that ‌our Father in Heaven and his ⁣Son Jesus Christ have ⁤in our​ day ​again called a ​living prophet and ⁢restored priesthood authority and covenants to bless families and individuals with joy. Members seek to live ⁣and share the gospel of Jesus Christ, care for those​ in need and unite families for eternity. They cherish ‌the Book of‍ Mormon and the Bible as holy scripture.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nThe churches also released a⁤ Q&A with more information ​about the purchase:\n\n“Today, Community of Christ and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced the transfer of significant historical properties and artifacts related to the‍ restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. ⁣The following answers address frequently asked questions about the details⁢ of the transaction and future plans for the ⁢historic sites and artifacts.\n\n1. What was ​included​ in the transaction?\n\nThe⁣ transaction involves land, buildings, artifacts, and documents. ‌The real estate, along with some artifacts, are in Kirtland, Ohio, ⁣and Nauvoo, Illinois, while artifacts and documents ‍also come from Community of Christ Library and Archives in Independence,‌ Missouri.\n\n2. What are the most ​significant items?\n\nThe most significant properties are the Kirtland Temple, ⁤the ⁢Smith Family Homestead, the Mansion ​House, ⁢the Nauvoo House, and the Red Brick Store. ‌Significant documents and artifacts include manuscripts and the Bible used⁢ in the‍ Joseph Smith⁢ Translation of the Bible, ⁢seven‍ letters ​from Joseph Smith to his ⁣wife Emma, ​John Whitmer’s⁣ history of the church, original portraits of Joseph and Emma Smith, ‌the⁢ cornerstone‍ of the Nauvoo House, the original door of‌ Liberty Jail, and a document with ‍the title of “Caractors,” which may contain a ‌sample of inscriptions ​from the gold plates. (See the appendix ⁢for a more detailed list of ‍items transferred.)\n\n3. How did ​Community of​ Christ acquire these materials?\n\nAfter the Saints left Kirtland in the ⁣1830s, different parties ⁣controlled access to ‌the temple over⁤ the‌ years. In 1901, Community of Christ, then known as the Reorganized Church of​ Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (“RLDS Church”) secured title to the‌ Kirtland⁢ Temple through legal proceedings.⁣ The⁣ Smith family properties in Nauvoo remained in possession of Emma Smith after Joseph Smith’s death and she and her children eventually joined the RLDS Church. Thereafter,⁣ the properties passed through family connections to⁣ the RLDS ⁤Church. ​Other documents and artifacts were donated⁢ to ⁣the RLDS Church archives by their individual ⁣owners.\n\n4. Why did Community of Christ sell these materials‌ now?\n\nAs Community of Christ President Stephen M. Veazey‍ noted in the joint statement, ⁢the transfer ‌of materials at this time enables ​their mission and ‌priorities around the world.\n\n5.⁢ Why did The Church of Jesus⁣ Christ of Latter-day⁢ Saints purchase these ​materials?\n\nThe sites‌ and ⁢artifacts in this‍ transaction relate to significant events and people in⁤ the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\n6. What is the relationship between the two churches?\n\nThe two churches enjoy a strong, respectful, and friendly relationship. For many decades, we have collaborated on numerous historical⁣ and humanitarian projects.\n\n7. Have there been previous transactions of ‍historic materials between the two churches?\n\nYes. In 2012,‌ Community of Christ sold to the Church of Jesus Christ ⁤several properties, including the Hawn’s Mill Massacre site and the Joseph‍ and‍ Emma Smith⁣ home in Kirtland. Five years later, Community of Christ sold the Printer’s Manuscript ⁤of the Book of Mormon to the ⁣Church of Jesus Christ.\n\n8. What was paid for the properties,‌ artifacts,‌ and documents?\n\nThe church‌ paid $192.5 million without ⁢assigning specific values to the⁤ properties and items.\n\n9. Will the historic sites be open to the public?\n\nYes. The historic buildings in Kirtland and Nauvoo closed​ on March 5, 2024, to facilitate the​ transfer of ownership and will ⁤reopen to the public ‌on March 25, 2024. Tours will be provided of the Kirtland⁣ Temple, the ​Smith Family Homestead, the Mansion House, and the‍ Red Brick Store. Updated visitor information will be published on the historic site webpages for Historic Kirtland and Historic Nauvoo.\n\n10. Will admission be charged to visit the‌ sites?\n\nNo. All of the ‍Church of Jesus Christ’s historic sites are ‌open​ to the⁣ public at no charge.\n\n11.‍ Will members of ​Community of Christ continue to have ​access to⁤ the sites?\n\nYes. The sites will be open to ‍the public​ generally. The church​ has‌ also made specific arrangements with Community of Christ to allow for special meetings and gatherings over the coming years.\n\n12. Will the Kirtland Temple be converted into ⁢a functioning Latter-day Saint temple?\n\nNo. The Kirtland Temple will be maintained and presented as a historic building that is open to the public. President Russell M. Nelson announced a temple‌ in ⁤Cleveland in ⁤April 2022, and the church released its site address in December ⁢2022 and a rendering in July 2023.\n\n13. Will the ⁢church continue to pursue development of ‌its proposed ⁤new visitors’ center near​ the Nauvoo Temple?\n\nYes. The proposed visitors’ ⁢center‌ in Nauvoo will orient⁣ visitors to the historic and ‌contemporary significance of the Nauvoo Temple. The use of the other‌ two visitors’ centers in Nauvoo will be determined⁣ in the future.\n\nDedicating another transferred property\n\nIn 2012, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints purchased 6,000⁢ acres of ⁤Missouri farmland, the Hawn’s⁤ Mill Massacre site and Far West Burying Ground in Missouri, ‍and Joseph and Emma ⁣Smith’s Kirtland home from the⁤ Community of Christ.\n\nOn Aug.‍ 26, 2023, Elder David A. Bednar of the⁣ Quorum of the Twelve Apostles dedicated the restored home, which offers views of the nearby Kirtland Temple.\n\nElder Bednar said, “The first temple (was built) here in Kirtland and (we have) more than 300 temples today. This⁢ work is true. It​ was in Kirtland that Joseph said that the church would grow, prosper and‌ spread. ‌It would⁣ fill North and South America. It would fill the world. That’s true. I’ve been ‍able to travel the world and see the fulfillment of that prophecy. ⁤So, coming to this place on⁣ this day ‌is a sacred experience‌ for me.”",

        "content": "From⁢ the heart of DENVER — A landmark case has seen a 78-year-old woman,​ Ruby Johnson, triumph in a lawsuit against two police ‌officers, following ‌an erroneous search of her home by a SWAT team. The search was conducted under the mistaken belief that her home harbored a stolen truck. The jury awarded Johnson a staggering $3.76 million, a⁣ verdict made possible by a recent Colorado law that permits citizens to sue police for infringing on ‌their ‍state ⁢constitutional rights.\n\nThe jury’s decision was delivered late Friday in a state court in Denver, with the⁢ American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Colorado, who assisted Johnson‍ in her legal battle, announcing the verdict on Monday. The lawsuit claimed that the police had obtained ⁤a search warrant for Johnson’s home based⁣ on information from the owner of⁢ the stolen‌ truck. The truck contained four semi-automatic handguns,⁢ a rifle, ‌a revolver, two drones, $4,000 in cash, and an iPhone. The owner had tracked the iPhone to Johnson’s ​residence using the Find My app ⁣and relayed this information⁢ to⁢ the police.\n\nAs per the lawsuit, Johnson, a retired U.S. Postal Service worker and grandmother, had just stepped out⁣ of the shower ⁤on ⁤the morning of Jan. 4, 2022, when she heard a loud command⁤ over a bullhorn instructing anyone inside the‍ house ⁤to exit with their hands up. Clad only in her bathrobe, ⁤she opened her front door to find an armored personnel‌ carrier parked on her ⁢front lawn, police vehicles lining her street, and men in full military-style gear, armed ‍with rifles and accompanied by a police dog.\n\nThe lawsuit further stated that ​Detective Gary Staab had erroneously‌ obtained the warrant to⁤ search Johnson’s home, failing to clarify that the⁣ app’s information is‍ not exact and only provides a general location of where a⁤ phone might be.\n\nNeither Staab nor the supervisor who approved the search warrant, Sgt. Gregory Buschy, who was also sued, responded to requests for comment. The ​Denver Police Department, which was not a defendant in the lawsuit, refrained from commenting on the verdict.\n\nThe lawsuit ⁢was ​filed‍ under a clause of a comprehensive police reform bill passed in 2020, ​following the murder of‍ George Floyd. This is‌ the first significant case to go to trial under⁤ this provision, according to the‍ ACLU of Colorado.​ The bill allows individuals to sue police‍ officers ⁣for ⁣state constitutional violations in state court. Prior to this, allegations of police misconduct could only be pursued in federal court, where it has become increasingly challenging ‍to⁢ litigate such cases,‌ largely due ‍to the legal doctrine known as qualified immunity. This doctrine protects officials, ​including police officers, from lawsuits seeking monetary damages for actions taken in the‍ course of their duties.\n\nThe lawsuit also detailed how the police⁤ used a battering ⁣ram to force entry into Johnson’s garage, despite her explaining how ​to⁤ open⁢ the door. They also damaged ‍the ceiling tiles to‍ access her attic, standing on one of her ⁤brand⁣ new‌ dining room chairs in the process. They even broke the head off a ‌doll made to ⁤resemble Johnson, complete ⁣with glasses, according to Tim Macdonald, ⁣ACLU of⁢ Colorado’s legal director.\n\nWhile Johnson is Black, the lawsuit did not claim that race was a factor in the incident,​ Macdonald clarified.\n\nMacdonald emphasized that the most ‌significant ​damage was inflicted ⁣on Johnson’s sense of security in her own home, where ⁤she had raised three children as a single⁤ mother. ‌She had even sacrificed Christmas​ and birthday⁤ gifts to afford the house. The⁣ incident led to her developing ulcers and sleep problems, eventually prompting ⁤her to relocate to a different neighborhood.\n\n“For us, the ‌damage was always about the psychological and⁢ the emotional ⁤harm⁢ to Ms. Johnson,” Macdonald stated.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON —⁣ In a significant‍ move on​ Monday, the ‍White House⁤ announced the ‍removal of its COVID-19 testing mandate ‌for individuals‍ who are expected to be in close proximity with President Joe ⁢Biden, ‍Vice President Kamala Harris, and their respective spouses. This decision marks the ⁤termination‍ of the final ‍COVID-19 prevention measure in place​ at the White⁤ House.\n\nThe White House clarified that this modification in policy is in line with ⁣the⁣ latest guidelines from the Centers for ⁤Disease Control‍ and Prevention (CDC). The CDC, last week, eased its previous advice that required individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 to isolate for⁢ five days. The updated guidance now states that individuals can resume work or their usual activities if their ​symptoms are mild, improving, and they have been fever-free for at ⁣least a day.\n\nThe testing protocol at the White ⁣House was first implemented in ‍the‌ early stages of the pandemic in 2020, during the⁤ tenure ‌of former President Donald Trump.

        "content": "WASHINGTON — On Monday, the Supreme Court reinstated Donald Trump’s name on the 2024 presidential primary ballots, dismissing state efforts to hold the former Republican president ⁤responsible for the Capitol riot.\n\nThe court’s decision, made just a day‍ before the⁢ Super Tuesday primaries, clarified ⁤that ⁣states cannot⁣ invoke a post-Civil War ​constitutional provision‌ to exclude⁣ presidential candidates from ballots without prior action⁣ from Congress.\n\nThis ruling puts an end ‌to attempts in⁣ Colorado, Illinois, Maine, and‍ other states to remove Trump, the leading ⁤candidate⁣ for his party’s nomination, from the ballot due to his efforts to‍ overturn his 2020 election⁤ loss to Democrat⁢ Joe Biden, which⁢ culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on⁣ the Capitol.\n\nThe case involving Trump was the Supreme⁣ Court’s first encounter with a provision of the 14th Amendment, adopted post-Civil War, designed to prevent former officeholders who “engaged ⁢in insurrection” from holding office again.\n\nIn a groundbreaking ruling, Colorado’s Supreme Court had determined that Section 3 of the provision could ⁢be applied to Trump,‌ whom the court found​ to have incited the Capitol attack. No previous court had applied‍ Section 3 to a presidential candidate.\n\nSome election analysts have cautioned that a ruling necessitating congressional action to implement Section 3⁤ could potentially ⁢reignite ‍a battle ⁢over using the provision to disqualify Trump should he win the election. In one hypothetical scenario, a Democrat-controlled Congress could attempt ​to reject the certification​ of Trump’s election on Jan. 6, 2025, under this clause.\n\nThe issue could then potentially return to the court.\n\nBoth ⁤parties had urged the court to expedite its decision, which was heard less than a month ago, on Feb. ⁤8. At⁣ that time,⁣ the ⁤justices appeared inclined to rule in favor of Trump.\n\nTrump had been removed from the ballots in⁤ Colorado, Maine, and Illinois, but all three rulings were temporarily suspended pending the Supreme Court’s decision.\n\nThis case represents the court’s most direct involvement in a presidential election since Bush v. Gore, a ‌decision made 25 years ago that effectively awarded the 2000‌ election to Republican George W. Bush. It’s​ just one of ⁤several ‍cases involving Trump directly or that could impact his ‍chances of becoming president again, including‍ a⁤ case set for arguments ‍in late April about whether he can be criminally ‌prosecuted on election interference charges, including his⁢ role in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. The timing of the high court’s intervention has sparked questions about whether Trump will ‌be tried before the November election.\n\nThe February arguments ⁢marked the first time the high ‍court had heard a case involving Section 3. This⁢ two-sentence provision, intended ‌to prevent some Confederates from holding office again, states that those who violate oaths to support the ⁢Constitution are ​barred from ​various positions including congressional offices or serving as presidential‌ electors. However, it does not specifically mention ⁢the presidency.\n\nJustices from both conservative and liberal sides questioned the case against Trump. Their primary concern was whether Congress must act before states⁣ can invoke the 14th Amendment. There were also questions about whether the ‍president is covered by the provision.\n\nThe attorneys representing Republican and independent voters ​who sued to ​remove Trump’s name ‍from the Colorado ballot argued that there is ample evidence that the events of Jan. ⁤6 constituted an insurrection and that it was incited⁢ by Trump, who had urged a crowd ⁢of his supporters at a rally outside the ⁤White House to “fight like hell.” They contended that it would be absurd to apply Section 3 to everything but‌ the presidency or that Trump is somehow exempt. They also argued​ that the provision does not require enabling ​legislation.\n\nTrump’s attorneys presented several arguments for why the⁤ amendment cannot be used to⁤ keep him off ⁢the ballot. They argued that the Jan. 6 riot wasn’t an insurrection and, even if it was,⁢ Trump did not go to the Capitol or join the rioters. They also stated that the wording of the amendment excludes the presidency and candidates running for president. Even if all these arguments were rejected, they said, Congress would need to pass legislation to revive Section 3.\n\nThe case was decided by a court that includes three justices appointed by Trump during his presidency. They have considered many Trump-related cases in recent ‍years, rejecting his claims of fraud in the 2020 election and refusing‍ to protect his ⁤tax records​ from Congress​ and prosecutors in New York.\n\nThe 5-4 decision in‍ the Bush⁢ v. Gore ‌case over 23 years ago was the last time the court was so deeply involved in presidential politics. Justice Clarence ​Thomas ⁤is the only member of the court ‌who was on the bench then. Thomas has disregarded calls by⁣ some ⁢Democratic⁣ lawmakers to recuse himself from the Trump⁤ case because his wife, Ginni,‌ supported Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election results and attended the rally⁤ that preceded the storming of the Capitol by Trump supporters.",

        "content": "From ​the heart of SALT LAKE‍ CITY, a significant development in the U.S. ⁣nuclear industry was announced.⁤ On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bipartisan bill aimed at bolstering nuclear projects. The bill aims to simplify the approval process and offers‍ financial incentives to development⁣ companies, helping them navigate through‌ regulatory ⁣challenges.\n\nThe bill, known ⁣as the ‌Atomic Energy Advancement Act, received⁢ an impressive 356-35 vote. This act is set to⁤ accelerate the development and construction of new nuclear reactors across the country.\n\nThe ‌bill’s overwhelming approval, backed by 166 Democrats, ‌signifies a significant shift in attitudes towards nuclear power as a viable source of carbon-free power generation. The‍ bill mirrors Senate ‍legislation approved earlier this year, as reported by the Washington Examiner.\n\nRep. John Curtis, R-Utah,​ a strong advocate for the bill, stated that these‌ reforms are crucial. He testified in favor of ‌the bill, which includes some financial provisions‌ he authored.\n\n“The Advanced Nuclear Reactor Prize Act would empower the secretary of energy to grant targeted ⁤awards to cover fees assessed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for⁤ first ‍technologies that are licensed and made operational in five unique⁢ categories. The bill stipulates that ‍awards cannot exceed total amounts expended by the eligible entity, excluding other federal support,” he explained.\n\nIn a press release, Curtis further emphasized the need ⁤for innovation in the ⁤nuclear sector. He stated, “The costs and red tape ⁤associated with our permitting process are proving to be⁢ duplicative and ineffective. We need⁣ innovation ​in the nuclear space to ensure affordable, reliable and clean energy in our future. Congress must do more to ensure that this can happen.”\n\nThe bill was passed ‌under suspension ‌of the body’s ‍rules.\n\nCurtis has first-hand experience with ​the lengthy process of bringing an advanced nuclear project to​ life. His district includes municipal power producers that were part of the Carbon Free Power Project by NuScale and the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems.\n\nUnfortunately,⁣ this project, which was the only advanced Small Modular Reactor technology to receive a design ‍approval from ‌the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, was canceled last year due to prolonged regulatory delays that increased ⁤costs for potential customers.\n\n“The costs and red tape associated with⁤ our permitting process are proving to be duplicative and ineffective. We need innovation ‌in the nuclear space to ensure affordable, ⁤reliable and clean energy in our future.”\n\n–Rep. John Curtis, R-Utah\n\nThe municipal power association had collaborated with NuScale Power for over a decade to establish a small nuclear power​ plant ⁤at the Idaho National Laboratory east of Idaho Falls.\n\nThe INL‍ is⁣ the U.S. Department ⁤of Energy’s leading laboratory for nuclear research. Despite ⁣significant investment from three presidential administrations, the project encountered prohibitive ‍costs and was ultimately abandoned.\n\nExpressing his ​disappointment, Curtis said, “I’m saddened to learn of this project’s cancellation. Current and future nuclear will play a vital role in America’s energy mix. This can be a learning experience for other SMR projects, ⁢and Congress should take this opportunity to ensure the permitting process for⁢ energy projects is designed to encourage innovation.”\n\nExpanding nuclear energy in the United States would boost the nation’s uranium industry,‌ including in Utah, which is home‌ to mining operations and the only conventional uranium mill operation in the United States, the White Mesa Mill in San Juan County. Despite a⁤ nearly tenfold increase ⁤in uranium concentrate production in 2023 due to a⁣ spike in prices, ⁢the United States domestically produces ‌only about 5% of the uranium it uses, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nThe provision by Curtis ‍was part of a larger bill sponsored ​by Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-South Carolina, who is chairman of the House Energy, Climate, and Grid⁤ Security Subcommittee.",

This‌ simple product has sparked a complex debate among politicians,⁤ parents, and commentators, reflecting the intricate ⁢landscape where Big Tobacco companies are pushing ‌alternative products, while experts grapple with their potential advantages and drawbacks.\n\nZyn,‍ marketed by Philip⁢ Morris International to adult tobacco users, comes in flavors like mint, coffee, and citrus.‍ However, videos of ‌young people using these pouches have garnered millions of views on TikTok and other social media platforms, raising concerns that Zyn ‌could be the ​next nicotine⁢ product to lure ​underage teens, much like Juul did, leading to a surge in vaping. Some experts ⁤argue‌ that the risk is offset by the⁤ potential to divert adults‌ from cigarettes and other traditional tobacco products, which are responsible for 480,000 U.S. deaths each year.\n\nDr. Jasjit Ahluwalia,‍ an addiction‌ specialist at Brown University, argues, “The definition of insanity is doing the⁣ same thing and expecting ⁤a different result. That’s what we’ve done with tobacco for decades. We’ve been all about ‍abstinence, instead of embracing products ​that can reduce harm.”\n\nAhluwalia views nicotine pouches‌ and e-cigarettes​ as tools to help smokers reduce or quit cigarettes.‍ This approach is common in the U.K., but​ it’s not mainstream ‍in the U.S., ‌where only pharmaceutical-grade medications⁤ like nicotine gum and lozenges are officially approved to aid ​smokers in quitting.\n\nAhluwalia points ⁢out that Zyn functions⁤ similarly to these products: it releases low levels of⁤ nicotine that are absorbed into the gums, reducing cravings. The main difference, he notes, is that Zyn is sold by Philip Morris, the global cigarette ‌giant and a longtime adversary of anti-smoking groups.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Zyn recently seeped into politics, causing a rift ⁢between Democrats and​ Republicans in Washington ​and‌ escalating into another ‌battle in the nation’s culture war.\n\nIn late⁤ January, ‍Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, of New York, ‌urged regulators to investigate Zyn,⁣ citing its‌ appeal to​ teens. Several House Republicans then ‌warned constituents that “Big Brother”⁣ planned to “ban nicotine.”\n\nConservative commentator Tucker Carlson, a Zyn user, joined the debate, ‍stating: “Zyn is​ not a sin,” and promoting ⁢its unproven benefits, like “enhancing male ‍vitality and mental acuity.”\n\nZyn users have ‍quickly developed ‌their own online jargon, including⁢ “zynnies,” “zynner” and “zynsky.”\n\n“There’s this online subculture around Zyn that’s been spearheaded by younger ⁤males, but a lot of that’s not coming ⁤from the⁤ brand itself,” said Ollie Ganz, a Rutgers University ⁢tobacco and nicotine researcher.\n\nOnline videos show young people documenting their first experiences trying⁣ Zyn, reviewing⁢ different ⁤flavor combinations and ​displaying piles of ⁤used canisters.\n\n“It’s concerning to see the countless​ Zyn-related memes and hashtags that ⁢are⁤ being amplified and normalized across social ⁢media,” said Kathy Crosby, CEO⁤ of ⁢the Truth ‍Initiative, an⁢ anti-tobacco advocacy group.\n\nTruth and other groups point to research⁣ suggesting nicotine can ​interfere with brain development in‍ adolescents.\n\nIt’s the Food and Drug Administration’s job to balance Zyn’s risks to youngsters against its potential to help adults.\n\nIn ⁣a statement, an FDA spokesman said the agency ⁣is monitoring ​underage use, noting that 1.5% of high school and middle schoolers reported using pouches last year. That’s well below ⁢the ⁤10% who‌ used e-cigarettes.\n\nFDA officials have allowed Zyn ​to stay on the⁤ market while they review Philip‌ Morris’ marketing application, which has been pending since 2020. If teen⁢ use remains‌ low, the company ‍could win FDA authorization for at least ⁢some of its offerings, which come in ‍multiple strengths and flavors.\n\nIn​ 2019, the FDA⁣ awarded its first-ever ⁤reduced risk designation to ‌a similar product: snus, a tobacco pouch popular in Sweden that contains lower levels of carcinogens than cigarettes. The FDA said smokers who switch to snus reduce their ⁤risk of lung cancer,⁢ bronchitis and other diseases.\n\nZyn excludes the tobacco leaves found in snus, leaving only nicotine, which Philip Morris says increases its appeal.\n\n“People can be reluctant to move into⁣ an oral tobacco product if they view it as ​similar to traditional chewing tobacco,” company⁤ spokesman Corey Henry said. “Consumer acceptability ⁤is a big part ​of ‍Zyn.”\n\nPhilip Morris doesn’t use online influencers or endorsements to promote Zyn, Henry said. Its website is restricted to ⁤adults​ 21 and older. ​And ⁣flavors like cinnamon and peppermint are “familiar to⁢ adults,” Henry said.\n\nZyn launched in the⁣ U.S.‌ in 2014, but sales have skyrocketed in the past year,⁣ generating $1.8 billion⁢ as shipments accelerated year-over-year ⁣by ‌over 60%.\n\nOn⁢ a November call ‌with retailers, one ⁤company executive called the growth “gonzo” and “lights out.”\n\n“I didn’t see this coming. I don’t know anyone who did,” said Joseph Teller, a director for oral tobacco ⁣products.\n\nZyn‌ promotions‌ emphasize the pouches’ discreet, convenient nature⁢ as a “smoke-free,” “spit-free” alternative for smokers⁣ “at⁤ work” or “on the move.”\n\nBut to fulfill the company’s stated goal of a “smoke-free future,” Zyn will need to help users fully switch from cigarettes, rather than alternating between ⁣the two.\n\nThere’s little data on⁢ switching, and preliminary​ research suggests pouches may not be a great substitute.\n\nOhio State University researchers recently found it‍ took smokers 30 ‍minutes to an⁢ hour to‌ get enough‍ nicotine from Zyn to ​relieve their cravings. With cigarettes, smokers achieved the same nicotine levels — and relief — in ⁣five ​minutes.",

        "content": "BETHEL, N.Y. — The iconic Woodstock festival, a cornerstone of 1960s counterculture, didn’t⁤ actually take place in Woodstock. Instead, it was held ​60 miles away⁣ in ​the quaint ⁤village of Bethel, New York. ‍This geographical misnomer is‌ fitting for an⁤ event ‌that has evolved into⁤ a legendary symbol of a transformative era, ⁤transcending its physical location to ​embody the ‌collective consciousness of a tumultuous decade.\n\nApproximately‌ 450,000 individuals, primarily teenagers and young adults, flocked to a parcel of land owned by dairy farmer Max Yasgur in August 1969. They were drawn by the promise of an “Aquarian Exposition” offering⁣ “three days of⁣ peace, love and music”. ⁢Today, as​ these attendees approach the twilight of their lives, only⁣ a small ‌fraction of the population retains living memories of the 1960s.\n\nRecognizing the urgency of ​preserving these fading‍ memories, the Museum at Bethel Woods, situated on the festival site, has embarked on a five-year project. The aim is to separate fact from folklore and gather firsthand accounts of⁢ Woodstock before they disappear. This mission‍ has led ‌museum curators on a nationwide journey⁣ to document‍ and safeguard the⁢ reminiscences of those who were there.\n\nMusic journalist Rona Elliot, 77, who has been serving as ⁢one of the ​museum’s “community connectors,” emphasizes the importance of capturing history from those who lived​ it. Elliot herself has unique insights about the⁢ festival, having worked closely with organizers like Michael Lang, who ‍entrusted her with his archives before his passing in 2022.\n\nElliot describes Woodstock as “a jigsaw puzzle — a kaleidoscope of ⁣everything that transpired in the ’60s.”\n\nWhile many Woodstock‍ attendees have shared their experiences‌ in interviews over the years, the Bethel Woods museum is delving deeper with a project initiated in 2020. The approach mirrors that of renowned ​historian Studs​ Terkel, who compiled extensive oral ⁢histories of life during the Great Depression and World War ⁢II.\n\nNeal​ Hitch, senior curator and director of the‌ Museum At Bethel Woods, explains the distinction between a casual interview and an oral history preserved in a ‌museum. The latter requires reaching out to people​ in their⁢ comfort zones, encouraging them to share intimate, personal memories from their⁤ youth.\n\nTo⁢ locate and‌ engage individuals willing⁣ to recount their Woodstock stories, the ⁢museum secured grants totaling ‌over $235,000 from the Institute of Museum and​ Library‍ Services. This funding enabled curators and community connectors ​like Elliot to traverse the ​country and record these narratives.\n\nThe journey commenced in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and has since⁣ taken⁢ the team to ⁣Florida, Ohio, and California, among other ⁤locations. They’ve‌ visited⁣ a “Flower ⁢Power” cruise ship and a community center ⁣near the former residences⁤ of ⁢festival performers Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead.\n\nRichard Schoellhorn,⁢ 77, traveled from his home in Sebastopol, California, to share‌ his Woodstock experience. Initially hired as a security guard, he ended up volunteering when the festival became so crowded ‌that ticket sales ‌were halted.\n\nAnother attendee, Akinyele Sadiq, also met with the ‍curators in San Francisco ⁣to share his memories of watching the festival from ​a prime spot ​near the stage. His journey to and⁢ from the festival, which included hitchhiking and a ride in a converted hearse, was transformative.\n\nSo far, the curators‌ have collected over 500⁤ oral histories, each revealing unique, life-altering experiences. The project continues, with ‍upcoming visits planned for Boston, New York City, New Mexico, and Southern California.\n\nThe museum plans to spend 2025 analyzing the oral histories and initiating‍ special projects, such as reuniting friends who attended the ​festival together but now live apart. Elliot believes that this project is her destiny and hopes it will serve as a valuable educational resource.\n\n“I want this to be a teaching tool,” she says. “I don’t want historians telling⁣ the story ‌of a spiritual event that just appeared to be a musical event.”",

        "content": "ATLANTA — On Friday, Donald Trump’s legal representative, Steve ⁢Sadow, presented​ an argument to a Georgia judge, suggesting‌ that the lead prosecutor in the⁤ case against the former U.S.⁤ president should‌ be ⁣disqualified. The reason for this request was ⁢an alleged undisclosed affair with a top deputy,⁤ which the prosecutor may have lied about in court.\n\nSadow argued ⁢that Fulton County ⁤District Attorney​ Fani Willis’ sworn statement that ⁢her relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade only began after his employment was not ​believable. He stated, “The moment there’s a ‌hint of impropriety… Georgia law is unequivocal: That’s sufficient‍ grounds for disqualification.”\n\nHowever, Prosecutor Adam Abbate⁤ refuted this claim, stating that three days⁢ of evidentiary⁤ hearings produced “no ⁢evidence” that Willis’ relationship infringed on the defendants’ constitutional ⁤rights to a fair ⁤trial. “For this ​reason, the ⁤disqualification motions should be rejected,” ⁤Abbate argued.\n\nJudge Scott⁣ McAfee, after the⁣ hearing, expressed his intention to deliver a ruling within a fortnight, but did⁤ not hint at his potential decision.\n\nTrump, who is currently leading⁣ the race for the 2024 ‌Republican presidential nomination, along with others, is charged with unlawfully ‌pressuring Georgia officials to ⁢reverse his⁤ 2020 election defeat in⁣ the state to President ‌Joe Biden. Trump and his 14 co-defendants have all ‌pleaded not guilty.\n\nA ruling in favor of Trump⁢ and his allies could ⁤further complicate an already intricate⁣ racketeering case that may have a lengthy‌ journey ​to trial. If Willis⁤ is disqualified, it would not necessarily terminate the ‍case, as she could be⁢ replaced by another district attorney. However, ‍this could cause significant delays,​ and a new prosecutor might narrow the charges or decide not to proceed with the case.\n\nThe final arguments before ⁣McAfee on Friday came after a series of evidentiary hearings where Willis admitted to having⁤ an affair with Wade​ but accused a defense lawyer of lying about ⁤the timing and nature ‍of their relationship.\n\nThe affair was initially disclosed⁤ in a January‍ filing by a lawyer for Michael Roman, who argued that it constituted a conflict of interest and unjustly benefited Wade. Willis and⁣ Wade testified that​ their relationship only started after Wade’s employment, and ⁢prosecutors have argued that the relationship is irrelevant to the case as it ​did ‌not harm the defendants.\n\nDefense ‍lawyers have accused the prosecutors of lying to the court, ​alleging that the relationship began before Wade’s employment. In court documents filed last‍ week, Trump’s lawyer referenced⁢ location data from Wade’s ‍cellphone, suggesting ​he made numerous late-night‌ visits to Willis’ home ⁣before his appointment.\n\nTrump‍ is also facing indictments ‍in three other state or federal criminal cases. He is scheduled ⁣to stand trial⁤ on March 25 in New⁤ York in a ⁣case accusing him⁣ of⁢ illegally concealing hush money payments‌ to‍ a porn star. This‌ could be the only trial he faces ‍before the November⁤ election.\n\nTrump has also been charged in Washington‍ over his attempts to reverse his 2020 election loss, but that case is on hold ‍until the U.S. ⁣Supreme Court decides whether he is immune from prosecution‌ for actions taken while in office. He is also under indictment in‍ Florida over his handling of classified documents ​upon⁣ leaving office. ‍The ⁣judge‌ overseeing that case held a hearing on⁤ Friday on Trump’s bid to move his​ May 20 trial date.\n\nTrump has pleaded​ not guilty in all⁣ these ⁢cases and‌ claims they are part of a politically motivated scheme ⁣to undermine his ⁣bid for office. If ‌he wins ‌the‍ presidency, Trump could use his presidential powers to end the Washington and Florida ​cases‍ because they ⁣were brought in federal court. However, he would not have the power to halt​ the Georgia case as it was brought in‍ state court.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — On Thursday, the U.S. Senate, which is currently under Democratic control, gave the green light to a temporary stopgap spending bill. This move was made to prevent a⁣ partial government shutdown, with the Republican-led House of Representatives also supporting ⁤the⁤ bill, just a little ​over a day before the funding was set to expire.\n\nThe bill, which received a bipartisan approval in the Senate with a 77-13 vote, is now headed to President Joe Biden’s⁣ office for his signature. The bill outlines deadlines ​for ​funding different sections of the government, with one part to be funded by March 8 and‌ the other by March 22.\n\nPresident Biden, in‍ a statement, expressed his relief at the bill’s passage, stating⁢ that it would prevent a harmful ⁢shutdown. However, he also noted that this is merely a temporary solution and not a⁤ long-term fix.\n\nEarlier⁢ in the day, ‌the House⁢ saw 207 Democrats and 113 Republicans come together​ in a 320-99 vote to pass the short-term stopgap measure. This move gives‌ Congress additional‌ time to⁤ agree on the funding for the full⁤ fiscal year, which started on‌ Oct.‍ 1.\n\nIt’s been about‍ two months since Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer agreed on a $1.59‌ trillion discretionary spending level for the fiscal year.\n\nJohnson, who has only been in⁣ the speaker’s position since late October,​ once again relied ⁤on a procedural move that required⁣ Democrats to provide most of the support to pass the ⁣stopgap spending bill. This strategy could potentially upset hard-line conservatives.\n\nWith 97 “no” votes from ⁢his 219-member Republican ‌conference, Johnson ‌could face challenges as he takes up six full-year appropriations bills next week and ⁤moves on to the complex issue of aid to Ukraine.\n\nThree House ‍Republicans, including House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, anticipate that Johnson will address​ aid to Ukraine, Israel, and U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific after completing another six spending bills by‍ March 22. Earlier this month, the Senate passed ⁤the‍ $95 billion ​national security bill in a bipartisan ​vote.\n\nMcCaul, an eternal optimist, believes that they will get it done. He suggested ‌that the legislation could include a loan program instead of direct ‌assistance and provide the means to seize and⁢ liquidate Russian sovereign assets as an⁣ offset.\n\nPresident Biden urged House Republicans to prioritize⁤ national security and expedite the bipartisan bill‌ to his desk.\n\nRepublican Representatives Brian Fitzpatrick and Don Bacon have also proposed aid legislation for U.S. allies that would ⁤reinstate⁤ the return-to-Mexico border policy and eliminate humanitarian assistance.\n\nDespite the​ passage of Thursday’s temporary funding⁣ bill, Congress may still face ​potential conflicts in the coming weeks over funding levels for many programs that conservatives wish⁣ to reduce.\n\nHard-line Republicans have been pressuring⁢ Johnson to ⁣use a ⁤shutdown as‍ a bargaining chip to compel Democrats ⁢to accept conservative policy measures, including partisan ⁢provisions to limit the influx of migrants across the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nRep.

Patrick McHenry predicted that Johnson ‍would face no threat as ⁣a result of votes on spending legislation, unlike his predecessor Kevin McCarthy, who a small ​group of hard-liners voted out of leadership for passing a bipartisan bill to avert a ‌shutdown in ‍September.\n\n“This is the House Republicans coming to ⁣terms with reality,” said McHenry. ⁣”It’s been clear for months that this is the outcome.

        "content": "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. — In a ​significant development, an Illinois state judge on⁤ Wednesday ruled that former President Donald Trump is ineligible to appear on the Illinois’ Republican ⁣presidential primary ballot. The decision was based on ⁢Trump’s involvement in the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol ⁣on Jan. 6, 2021. However, the judge has ‌postponed the implementation of her ruling, ⁢anticipating an appeal from Trump.\n\nJudge Tracie⁤ Porter of the Cook County⁤ Circuit Court agreed with⁢ the Illinois voters who contended that Trump’s actions violated the anti-insurrection clause of the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment. As a result, they ​argued, he should be excluded ⁤from the state’s March 19 primary ballot and its Nov. 5 general election ballot.\n\nThe ultimate resolution of the Illinois case, along with similar ​challenges in other‌ states, will likely be determined by the U.S. Supreme Court.⁣ The Supreme Court heard arguments⁣ related to Trump’s ballot eligibility on Feb. 8.\n\nPorter stated that she was delaying her decision due to the likelihood of Trump appealing to Illinois’ appellate courts and a potential ruling from the U.S. Supreme⁢ Court.\n\nThe advocacy group Free Speech For⁢ People, which led the Illinois disqualification effort, hailed the ruling as a ⁢”historic victory” in a statement.\n\nA spokesperson for Trump’s campaign, who ‍is currently the national frontrunner for the 2024 Republican nomination, described the ruling as “unconstitutional” and ⁢vowed to appeal ‍it swiftly.\n\nEarlier, Colorado and Maine had‌ also removed Trump from their state ballots, citing his disqualification under Section 3 of ⁣the 14th Amendment to ‌the Constitution. Both decisions are currently on hold pending Trump’s appeals.\n\nSection 3 prohibits anyone who has sworn an oath to support the U.S. Constitution from​ holding ‍public office if ⁣they have “engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.”\n\nOn Jan. 6,‍ 2021, Trump supporters attacked police and stormed the Capitol in an attempt to prevent ​Congress from certifying⁣ Democrat‍ Joe Biden’s 2020 ⁤election ‌victory. Trump​ had earlier delivered a speech to his supporters, urging them to go to the Capitol and⁣ “fight like hell.” He then failed to respond to requests to call off the mob for​ several hours.\n\nThe Supreme Court is currently‍ considering Trump’s challenge to his disqualification in Colorado.

        "content": "NEW YORK‌ —⁢ A verdict was reached on Tuesday, convicting two men for the murder of Jam ‌Master Jay, a member of the‍ iconic rap ‌group Run-DMC. The infamous 2002 shooting took place⁤ in the legendary rapper’s studio.\n\nThe Brooklyn federal⁣ jury, whose identities were kept anonymous, found Karl Jordan Jr. and Ronald Washington guilty of‍ the murder.⁤ Prosecutors argued that the motive behind the killing was retaliation for a botched drug deal.\n\nJam Master Jay, whose real name was Jason Mizell, was a pivotal figure in the ⁣hip-hop scene during⁢ the 1980s. As a member of Run-DMC, he played a significant role in bringing hip-hop into the​ mainstream ​pop music‍ scene.‍ The group was known ‌for hits like “It’s ⁤Tricky” and their unique rendition of Aerosmith’s “Walk This‌ Way.”\n\nThe murder of‌ Jam Master Jay, much like the⁣ killings of Tupac Shakur and​ the Notorious B.I.G.⁣ in ⁢the ‌late 1990s, remained a mystery for years. Despite numerous tips and rumors, authorities struggled to find witnesses​ willing to come forward.\n\nBreon Peace, the leading federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, explained the‍ difficulty in solving the case. “The witnesses in the recording studio ‍knew the killers, and they were terrified that they would be retaliated against if they cooperated with law enforcement and identified‍ the ruthless executioners of Mr. Mizell. But their strength and resolve​ in testifying at this trial were a triumph of ⁢right ‌over ‌wrong and courage over fear.”\n\nInterestingly, Jordan, 40, was the godson of the renowned DJ, while Washington, 59, was ​a long-time friend who was staying at the DJ’s sister’s house. Both men ⁤were arrested in 2020 ‌and pleaded not⁤ guilty.\n\nFollowing the guilty verdict, Washington expressed his outrage at the​ jury, shouting, “Y’all just ⁢killed two innocent people.” Jordan’s supporters also voiced ‍their ⁤anger at the⁣ verdict, with Jordan⁢ expressing his love⁢ for​ them before they ‍were escorted out of the courtroom by U.S. Marshals.\n\nThe defense attorneys for both men⁣ have formally‍ requested​ the judge to overturn‍ the jury’s⁣ guilty verdict and acquit them. ⁢”We’re optimistic,” said Susan Kellman, one of⁤ Washington’s lawyers. “My client‌ did not do this.‍ And the‍ jury heard testimony ​about the ⁤person who did.”\n\nBoth men’s⁢ names⁤ have⁤ been associated with the case⁢ for years. Washington was publicly named as​ a suspect in 2007. In a 2003 interview with Playboy magazine, he claimed ‍to have been outside ⁣the studio when the shooting ‍occurred and saw “Little D” — one of Jordan’s aliases — fleeing the scene.\n\nDespite Run-DMC’s anti-drug message, ‍Mizell was⁢ reportedly involved in the⁣ drug trade to cover his debts and maintain his generous lifestyle. “He was a man who got ⁢involved in the drug game​ to take care of the people who depended on him,” said Assistant U.S. ⁢Attorney Artie McConnell.\n\nAccording to the prosecution, Mizell had planned‌ to ‍acquire 10 kilograms of ‍cocaine ‍and distribute it ⁤through Jordan, ⁤Washington, and a dealer based in Baltimore. However, the Baltimore dealer refused to work ⁣with ​Washington, leading to the alleged retaliation.\n\nTwo​ eyewitnesses, Uriel Rincon, a former studio aide, and Lydia High,‍ Mizell’s former business manager, testified that Washington blocked the door‌ and ordered ⁣High to lie on the floor while brandishing ⁣a gun. Rincon identified Jordan as the man who greeted Mizell moments before the shooting.\n\nOther witnesses testified that both​ Washington and Jordan made ​incriminating statements about the murder after​ it occurred.‍ However, their lawyers questioned the credibility and memory ‌of these witnesses, noting that some initially denied ‌being able to identify the attackers.\n\nThe trial also shed light on a third‍ defendant, Jay Bryant, who was charged last year after his DNA‌ was found on a hat⁣ at the scene. Bryant has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting a separate trial.\n\nDespite the case potentially tarnishing Mizell’s image, J. Christopher​ Hamilton, a media professor at Syracuse University, argues that his achievements should still be recognized. “If he was indeed involved in dealing drugs, that ‌doesn’t mean to ⁢say his achievements shouldn’t be lauded,” said Hamilton.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON‍ — In a ⁤strategic move to better prepare for future warfare, the U.S. Army is reducing⁤ its⁤ force size by‌ approximately ⁣24,000, or nearly⁤ 5%. This decision‍ comes in the wake‍ of recruitment challenges that ‍have made ⁤it difficult to fill ​all necessary positions.\n\nMost of the reductions will ​be in currently⁤ vacant positions, not active-duty soldiers.‌ These include roles related to counter-insurgency, ⁢which expanded during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars⁢ but are less necessary today. Approximately 3,000 of these reductions will ⁣be from Army special operations forces.\n\nSimultaneously, ⁢the Army plans to‍ increase its strength in other crucial areas by adding about ‌7,500 troops. These include air-defense and ‍counter-drone ⁣units, as ⁢well as five ‍new global task forces with enhanced cyber, intelligence, and‍ long-range strike ⁤capabilities.\n\nAn ⁤internal Army document reveals that the service is “significantly overstructured” with not enough soldiers to fill existing units.⁢ The document clarifies that the reductions ⁢are in “spaces” not “faces”, meaning⁢ the​ Army will not be asking soldiers to leave the force.\n\nThe ⁣decision reflects the ​reality that the Army has ​struggled to fill thousands of empty posts for ‍years. The current⁣ structure allows for up to 494,000 soldiers, but the actual​ number of active-duty soldiers is about 445,000. The new plan aims to recruit enough ​troops over the next five years to reach a level of ⁢470,000.\n\nThis restructuring ‍follows two decades of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, which necessitated a rapid and significant expansion of the Army. The focus of the military⁢ has since shifted towards great power‌ competition from adversaries such as China and ‌Russia, and threats from Iran and North ⁢Korea. The conflict in Ukraine has highlighted the need for a‌ greater emphasis on air-defense systems‍ and high-tech abilities to​ use and counter airborne ⁢and sea-based drones.\n\nA Strategic​ Shift for More Advanced Adversaries\n\nArmy leaders have conducted a thorough review‍ of all the service’s job specialties to identify areas for reduction. They also examined ‌the ongoing⁢ effort ‌to modernize the Army with new‍ high-tech weapons to determine where additional forces should be concentrated.\n\nAccording​ to‍ the plan, the Army ‌will eliminate about ‌10,000 positions⁢ for engineers and similar roles that were tied to⁤ counter-insurgency missions. An additional 2,700 reductions will come from units that don’t​ deploy often and can be trimmed, and 6,500 will come ⁢from various​ training‍ and other posts.\n\nApproximately 10,000 positions will ‍be cut from cavalry squadrons,⁣ Stryker brigade combat teams, infantry brigade combat teams, ​and security force assistance brigades, which⁢ are used to train foreign‍ forces.\n\nThese ⁤changes signify a significant shift ⁣in the Army’s preparation for large-scale combat operations against more advanced enemies. However, they also highlight the significant recruitment challenges faced by all military services.\n\nChallenges in Recruitment\n\nIn the last fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, the Navy, Army, and Air⁤ Force all fell short of their recruitment goals, while the Marine Corps and the newly formed Space Force ⁢met‍ their ⁣targets. The Army recruited just over 50,000 ‌individuals, falling significantly short of ⁤the‌ ambitious goal of 65,000.\n\nThe previous fiscal year also‌ saw​ the Army‍ miss its ‌enlistment goal by 15,000, with a target of 60,000.\n\nIn response to these challenges, the Army launched‌ a comprehensive overhaul of ‌its⁤ recruiting last fall. The focus is now on young people who have spent ⁣time in college or are early in their careers. The Army is also forming a new professional force ⁢of recruiters, moving away from the previous practice of randomly assigning soldiers to the task.\n\nArmy Secretary⁢ Christine Wormuth acknowledged that the service has struggled with recruitment “for many​ more⁣ years ⁤than one would think from just looking at the headlines​ in the last ​18 months.” She revealed that the service​ hasn’t⁣ met its annual ‍goal ​for new enlistment contracts since⁣ 2014.",

        "content": "As we edge closer to spring break, it seems that the travel bug has‍ bitten Americans harder than‌ ever before.\n\nAccording to the ⁢AAA organization, there’s been a “substantial surge” in⁤ the demand​ for flights and cruises in anticipation⁢ of the​ spring ‍break season. Popular ‍destinations ⁤include sun-soaked states such as Arizona, California, Florida, and Nevada. However, there’s also been a noteworthy‍ 20% increase in international ‍travel compared ‌to ‍last year,‌ with a particular uptick in trips to Europe, in addition to the usual‌ spring break hotspots like⁤ Mexico.\n\nFurthermore, the organization has noted a 28% increase in⁢ cruises scheduled for March and April. Cruises setting sail from the sunny​ shores of southern Florida have seen a ‍whopping 60% increase from ⁤the previous‌ year.\n\n“We’re⁢ anticipating a ⁢vibrant mix of⁣ travelers,‍ ranging⁣ from meticulous planners ⁤to spontaneous adventurers,”‍ commented Julian Paredes, a spokesperson​ for​ AAA Utah.\n\nSpring break​ kicks ⁤off⁣ as early as next week for some Utah college campuses, before extending to ⁤Utah’s ‌K-12 schools in late March and early⁤ April. AAA⁤ advises⁢ those planning to travel to prepare well in advance for⁢ their trip,⁤ which may include ensuring their vehicle‍ is road ⁣trip-ready.\n\nThe ‍travel forecast seems to be in line with the⁤ significant ​strides made in ⁣Utah’s travel industry last year. For example, Salt Lake City International Airport not ‍only surpassed pre-COVID-19 pandemic⁢ levels but also⁣ set a new ⁢record with ​26.96⁢ million‍ passengers in 2023. ⁢Provo Airport also broke records, ‌with passenger‍ loads ‌exceeding 1 ‍million,⁣ a ⁤milestone reached⁣ about a decade earlier than‍ initially expected.\n\nHowever, this​ surge ‍in travel may coincide with⁤ a potential increase in gas prices‌ this summer.⁢ AAA reported last week that the national ‍average remained‍ stable after a sudden spike, possibly linked to ​issues at a major Indiana refinery that have since been‌ resolved. Andrew ⁢Gross, the organization’s national spokesperson, ⁢warned⁢ that a “seasonal ​rise ​in gas prices is on ‍the horizon” as the ⁤weather starts ⁣to warm up.\n\nGas prices⁣ typically peak ‌in⁣ the⁢ summer due to various factors,‍ including demand and the cost of producing the ⁣summer blend of gasoline.\n\nWhile Utah’s average gas price⁢ remains below the national average, it has begun to climb ⁤in recent‌ weeks‌ as spring and summer draw nearer. A gallon of ⁣regular⁢ gas in ⁣Utah currently costs around $3.04, approximately 22 cents below ⁣the national average, as ⁢per AAA.⁣ Just ‌last week, Utah’s average price was ​$2.95,⁢ and ​$2.65 ‍last month.",

        "content": "From the heart of SANTA FE, N.M.,‌ the​ manslaughter⁤ trial of Alec⁣ Baldwin, a renowned actor, ⁢is‍ set to commence on July 10. This follows the tragic incident that occurred in 2021, ⁣where cinematographer​ Halyna Hutchins was fatally shot‌ on the set of the Western film “Rust”. The ruling ⁢was ‌made by a New Mexico judge on ⁢Monday.\n\nIt’s worth noting that there’s a scarce record of actors in Hollywood being criminally liable for a shooting death during ‍a‍ film production.\n\nThe ‌unfortunate incident led to the death of Hutchins when a live round was discharged from the revolver Baldwin was holding, which also injured director Joel Souza.\n\nThe “Rust”⁤ armorer, Hannah Gutierrez, is also facing trial for allegedly⁣ introducing the live ⁣round​ on set and failing to identify it. She confessed to the police that she loaded the​ live round into Baldwin’s gun, mistaking it for ​a dummy round.\n\nHowever, Gutierrez’s lawyers argue that she is being unfairly blamed for Baldwin’s​ failure to adhere‌ to ‍basic firearm safety protocols. Gutierrez, like Baldwin, is facing an involuntary manslaughter charge.\n\nBaldwin maintains ‍his innocence,⁣ stating that he‌ is not responsible for Hutchins’ death. His legal team is planning to file a motion to⁤ dismiss‌ the ​charges, arguing that the grand‌ jury did not follow‍ the judge’s rules when ⁣they reinstated charges against him in January, after they were initially dropped in April 2023.\n\nDuring Gutierrez’s trial on Monday, an FBI firearms expert‌ testified that⁤ the Italian-made Pietta reproduction Colt .45 revolver⁤ Baldwin​ was holding would ⁤not discharge when fully cocked unless the trigger was pulled.\n\nThis testimony contradicts Baldwin’s initial statements​ after the shooting. He claimed that he cocked ⁢the gun but did not pull the trigger.\n\n“The ‌gun would ⁢not discharge without pulling the trigger in the full cock position,” testified FBI forensic ⁢examiner Bryce Ziegler. He ‌added that he⁢ had to strike the gun’s hammer⁣ with a rawhide mallet to make it discharge in the fully-cocked ⁤position.\n\nIn a December 2021 interview with ‌ABC television, Baldwin⁢ stated⁤ that it was the ⁢responsibility of Gutierrez and others to ensure firearm safety,‍ and live rounds should never have been brought on ⁢set.\n\nFor over a century, ‌live rounds have been prohibited on ‌movie sets due​ to fatalities caused by their use during Hollywood’s silent⁢ era.\n\nThe SAG-AFTRA union, representing ‌the movie industry, has backed Baldwin’s stance, asserting that ⁢actors are not hired to be ‍weapons experts.\n\nThe outcome of‌ Gutierrez’s trial is likely to influence Baldwin’s defense strategy. If she is found guilty, legal experts⁢ believe it would be challenging to‌ convict​ Baldwin ‍of criminal negligence, as ‍it would be difficult to hold both Gutierrez and Baldwin accountable for firearm safety.\n\nIn a December 2021 television interview, Baldwin⁣ stated ‍that he was instructed to‌ aim the⁣ gun at the camera when it discharged.\n\n“I didn’t pull the trigger,” Baldwin told ABC television journalist George Stephanopoulos.‌ “I ​cocked the gun and go, ‌’Can you see that? ⁢Can ‌you see that?‌ And ‌I let go of ⁢the hammer of the gun⁣ and ​the⁤ gun goes off.”\n\nLast ‌year,⁤ charges against Baldwin were dropped after ⁣new evidence suggested that the hammer of the “Peacemaker” Colt 45 ‍might have been modified, and the gun⁤ could have ‌discharged without the trigger being pulled.\n\nHowever,⁤ prosecutors convened a grand⁢ jury to recharge Baldwin after an independent test of the single-action revolver confirmed the FBI’s findings that it⁤ would not ‍discharge without a trigger pull.\n\nZiegler stated that he did not observe ‍any⁣ modifications to the firearm ⁣when⁤ it arrived at the FBI labs⁤ in Quantico, Virginia.\n\n“The ​firearm⁣ was functioning normally when I received it,” he ‍said.",

        "content": "From the heart of SALT LAKE CITY —‍ As the ​presidential election year kicked off, the ⁣spotlight was firmly on Iowa and New Hampshire. The question‍ on everyone’s lips was which‌ Republican presidential candidate would secure the first⁤ electoral caucus ​victories of ‍2024 in these states.\n\nA recent study by WalletHub delved into ‌the composition‍ of electorates,​ examining how closely they mirror the⁣ demographics of ​the population they represent. The study also sought to⁢ identify which state is ⁣the most representative of ‌the United States as a ⁢whole.\n\nStates that closely mirror the‌ overall representation:\n\nIllinois\nFlorida\nOhio\nVirginia\nPennsylvania\n\nStates that deviate ​significantly from ‌the overall representation:\n\nUtah\nMississippi\nAlabama\nWyoming\nVermont\n\nAccording to WalletHub analyst Cassandra Happe, “Illinois, Florida, and Ohio are far more representative‍ of the electorate than Iowa and New Hampshire, which rank ‍19th and 36th respectively out of the 50 states in terms of how well their ⁤demographics align with the U.S. population⁤ overall.” She suggests that the ⁢order of states in ​the⁣ presidential primaries should be based on⁢ representation rather than​ tradition or political favoritism.\n\nWhat differentiates the ‌most​ and least representative states?\n\nGiven ​the immense diversity of the ⁢United States, no single state can perfectly mirror the nation in ⁢all⁢ aspects. ‍However, ⁤Illinois came closest with a “94% similarity‍ when all demographics are averaged.”\n\nThe survey found that Illinois closely mirrors the nation in ⁢terms of‍ gender, age, the proportion of residents born in the U.S., ⁢and the unemployment rate, with over ‌99% similarity in each​ of these metrics.\n\nOn ⁢the other hand,⁢ Utah was found to be the least representative state, ranking⁢ last in the following categories:\n\nReligious composition of adults;\nWealth gap;\nAge characteristics;\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that every state contributes uniquely to the nation’s tapestry. The⁣ concept of being‌ the “worst” ⁣or “best” ‌representative is largely ⁣subjective and depends on the metrics used for comparison.\n\nThe significance of⁣ Iowa and New Hampshire in the presidential ⁤primaries\n\nFor years,⁣ Iowa and New ⁤Hampshire have been the first‌ ports of call ‌for presidential candidates on their campaign trail.\n\n“Since 1976, both parties have held their‌ first presidential nominating contests in Iowa, and the Iowa state legislature passed a law stating that its ‍caucuses need to be held‍ at least eight days before any other nominating ‍contest,” according to​ the National Constitution Center. “While Iowa ​holds the nation’s first presidential​ nominating contest, New ⁤Hampshire holds⁢ the nation’s first‌ primary election.”\n\nDespite their pivotal role in ⁢the presidential ⁢nomination process, neither ⁣state accurately reflects⁣ the nation’s ethnic and racial diversity. Furthermore, New Hampshire has an older median age compared‌ to the national average, as per the U.S. ⁣Embassy Japan.\n\nIn the WalletHub survey, Iowa and⁤ New Hampshire ranked ‌19th and 36th respectively in the electorate representation index. These rankings have​ led critics to question the disproportionate ⁤influence these states have in every presidential election.\n\nWhen ⁤asked if states that more ⁣closely mirror the national electorate ⁤should have their primaries earlier in the process, Alison Dagnes, professor and chair ​of the ⁢political science department at Shippensburg University, told WalletHub, ⁢”The national electorate is diverse, but some states have electorates that are far more homogenous.\n\n“Also, the Democratic Party tends to be more‌ diverse than ⁤the GOP, which means⁢ that ⁣the two parties​ are speaking to different⁢ constituencies. This is why the Democrats changed their primary schedule to make South Carolina, which is a more ⁢diverse ⁣state, hold their first-in-the-nation‌ primary. The ⁣parties ⁢can ⁢change⁢ the ⁣election order to​ best suit their needs since the parties are the ​ones who hold the ‍primary ⁢elections in the first place,” Dagnes⁢ added.",

        "content": "FLINT, Mich. — In a landmark case, a man has become the first individual to be charged under Michigan’s new law that mandates ‍gun owners to securely store their ​firearms in locked containers, especially ⁣in the presence of minors.\n\nThis case has sparked a nationwide conversation about similar laws in other states and the⁣ discretion of prosecutors‍ in deciding when to invoke these laws for ‍criminal charges.\n\nThe issue is particularly contentious in Michigan, where another county’s⁤ prosecutors recently achieved the ⁣first-ever conviction‍ in the U.S. against a parent whose child perpetrated ⁣a mass school shooting.\n\nEarlier this week, authorities reported that Michael Tolbert, 44, neglected ‌to secure his revolver, which his⁣ 2-year-old daughter accessed and critically injured ‍herself ⁣with. Tolbert now faces nine felony charges, including first-degree child abuse and violation of Michigan’s gun storage law.\n\nThe ‍tragic incident occurred just a day after Michigan’s new law on ⁣gun storage around children came into effect.\n\nGenesee County prosecutors have confirmed that Tolbert has pleaded not guilty. According to online court records, he is represented by the county’s office of the public defender. A ⁤spokesperson for the office stated on ​Thursday that Tolbert would be‌ assigned an attorney but had not ⁤yet met with​ his ‌defense.\n\nIn response to a 15-year-old student opening​ fire at his high school in Oxford Township, killing four classmates, Michigan Democrats proposed a comprehensive package of legislative measures on guns in 2021.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t until Democrats took full control of the ⁤Legislature from Republicans ⁢in 2022 that these proposals could be passed. A second mass shooting on the Michigan State University campus in February further propelled these measures to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nThe new storage law mandates gun owners to store unloaded firearms in a ⁣locked box or container when it is “reasonably known that a minor is or is⁤ likely to be ⁢present on the premises.”\n\nThe law also outlines several levels of potential prison time or fines, with higher penalties if a child uses an unsecured gun,⁢ injures themselves or someone ‌else, or ⁤causes a death. The law does make some exceptions, such as supervised use or acting in self-defense.\n\nAccording to the Giffords​ Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Michigan is‌ one of 21 U.S. states that have laws allowing criminal‍ charges‍ against ⁣individuals who fail to keep a gun inaccessible to a minor.\n\nThese laws,‌ often referred to as “child access prevention” laws, vary from state to state. In‍ some states,⁢ the ⁢law only applies if the ‌gun is discharged. Others have stricter laws that apply even if the gun is not fired or does not cause harm.\n\nState storage laws also define “minor” differently. In some states, teenagers older than 14 would not be considered a minor.\n\nThere is a lack of comprehensive national data on this issue.\n\nSome prosecutors view these laws as an unnecessary punishment, especially after a ‌child’s death. Others see it as a way to encourage other gun ‌owners⁤ to secure their weapons away from children.\n\nA 2017 investigation by the USA Today‌ Network and the Associated Press ⁢found that‍ prosecutors brought charges about ‌half the time ⁢from ‌2014 to 2016 in ​cases where ‍children under age 12 either killed themselves or were mistakenly‌ shot and⁣ killed by another child.\n\nThe investigation analyzed reports from all ⁣states, not just those with laws ⁢requiring⁤ certain types of gun ⁣storage.\n\nThe investigation ‍also found that the circumstances often didn’t seem to matter when comparing cases⁣ that resulted in charges to those that did not. But in nearly all cases where the gun owner had a felony record,⁤ prosecutors‍ did ⁢pursue charges.\n\nMichigan prosecutors have stated that​ Tolbert was prohibited from possessing firearms and ammunition due to multiple firearms-related felony convictions and drug-related convictions.\n\nIn another high-profile U.S.‌ case, the Virginia mother of ​a 6-year-old boy who shot his teacher initially ⁢faced charges of⁤ felony ​child neglect and a misdemeanor count of recklessly storing a firearm.‌ Prosecutors dropped the storage charge as part of a plea deal.\n\nErin Davis, ⁣senior counsel director of litigation at the⁢ anti-gun⁣ violence​ organization Brady, said laws aimed at ⁤gun storage ⁤are ‍educational tools, not a punishment.\n\n“It’s really analogous to requiring children to be in car seats or to wear seat belts,” ​Davis​ said. “The goal is to change behavior to save ⁣lives.”\n\nKelly Drane, research director at the Giffords Law Center, agreed.\n\n“While we don’t have hard data on ​this, lack of prosecutions doesn’t preclude the law‌ from⁤ working⁤ — it still sets a cultural standard that can help encourage more responsible behavior,” Drane said.\n\nEven in states without laws on gun storage or kids’ access, prosecutors have other options to criminally charge ⁢parents or caregivers.\n\nWe can’t measure a negative.\n\n–Kym ⁣Worthy, Wayne County Prosecutor\n\nMichigan’s most notable⁢ example is the involuntary manslaughter charges filed against James and Jennifer Crumbley ⁣after ⁤their son killed four of his high school classmates in 2021.\n\nJennifer Crumbley was found guilty this‌ month, marking the first time‌ a U.S. ⁣parent was held accountable for a child carrying out a mass school​ attack. James ​Crumbley faces ‌trial in March. He ​has pleaded not ‍guilty.\n\nExperts agree that the circumstances of this case are extreme. Prosecutors⁣ argue that the Crumbleys made a gun‌ accessible to their son, ignored his deteriorating mental health, and didn’t take him‍ home when ⁢school officials called them to the building to show the teen’s ​parents his ⁤concerning drawings the​ day of ​the attack.\n\nWayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy — whose jurisdiction ​includes ​Detroit and is the most populated in Michigan — has routinely brought charges of child abuse or involuntary ⁤manslaughter against parents after their children have killed or wounded themselves⁢ or others with an unsecured gun.\n\nThe latest charges were filed in December against the mother and father of a 5-year-old boy who was shot in the face. Detroit Police Chief James White told reporters the boy found the gun on top of a dresser and was jumping on a bed when ⁤it fired.\n\nWorthy said it’s easier to prove a violation of the new law beyond a reasonable doubt compared to prosecuting other potential charges in such cases. But it’s impossible to know​ whether the laws or the charges push more people to secure their guns,‍ she said.\n\n“We can’t measure a negative,” Worthy ⁤said, but she hopes that bringing​ attention to the laws “will be more of a deterrent.”",

However, flight controllers ‌are still ⁤working to ascertain its exact location ‍and orientation.\n\nIntuitive Machines, the ⁤company behind the mission, announced on Friday that they are in communication with their lander, Odysseus, and are sending commands to gather scientific data. They added, “We are continually gaining more insights about the vehicle’s specific‌ details” concerning its ⁤location, overall health, and positioning.\n\nThe Houston-based company had targeted the south polar region, near the Malapert A crater, which is ⁢closer ⁣to the pole than any other nation’s lunar landers.⁤ This would ⁣allow NASA to ⁤survey the area before astronauts ‍arrive later this decade.\n\nWith the ⁤successful landing ‌on Thursday, Intuitive Machines has made history as the first private company to achieve a moon ⁢landing, a feat ⁣previously⁣ accomplished by only five countries. The⁢ mission was largely sponsored by NASA, which had its experiments on board. NASA ‍invested ⁢$118 million in the delivery as part⁢ of a program designed to stimulate the lunar‍ economy.\n\nWhen the lander’s⁣ navigation system malfunctioned in the final hours before touchdown, one of NASA’s experiments was put to use. The lander ‌took an additional lap around the moon to allow time for the switch to ​NASA’s laser system.\n\n“Odie is ⁣a fighter,” said mission director⁣ Tim Crain late Thursday via social media.\n\nAnother ⁤experiment, a⁣ cube equipped with⁢ four cameras, was intended to detach 30 seconds before touchdown ⁣to capture images of Odysseus’​ landing. However, ‌Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University’s EagleCam was intentionally powered down during⁢ the final⁤ descent due to the navigation switch and remained attached to the lander.\n\nTroy Henderson from​ Embry-Riddle stated that his team will attempt to​ release‍ EagleCam in the coming days to photograph the lander from approximately‍ 26 feet away.\n\nWith the exact location of Odysseus on the moon still uncertain, “securing that final image of the lander on the surface remains an incredibly ‌important task for us,” Henderson told the Associated Press.\n\nIntuitive Machines expects ⁢the solar-powered lander to operate on the moon for just‌ a week before lunar nightfall sets in.\n\nThe company was ⁣the second to target the moon under‍ NASA’s⁢ commercial lunar services program. Last ⁢month, Pittsburgh’s Astrobotic Technology attempted ‍a similar feat, but a fuel leak on the lander ⁣cut the mission ‍short, resulting in the craft crashing back to Earth.\n\nBefore Thursday, the⁢ last⁢ U.S. landing on ⁢the moon was by Apollo 17’s ‍Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt, who concluded​ NASA’s⁣ renowned moon-landing​ program in December⁤ 1972. NASA’s new initiative to return astronauts to the moon is⁣ named Artemis, after Apollo’s mythological twin sister. The first Artemis crew ⁤landing is scheduled for ⁤no earlier⁤ than 2026.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — In a significant development, the Supreme Court on Thursday‌ gave the green light to the‌ Boy Scouts of America’s $2.46 billion settlement with victims of sexual abuse,⁤ thereby ⁤lifting a temporary halt that had been put in place due to an appeal by 144 former scouts who were against the ⁣agreement.\n\nThis decision overrules the one made ⁤by Justice Samuel Alito on Feb. ⁢16, ​which had put the settlement on hold to allow ‌the full court more time to review a Feb. 9 request by ⁣abuse claimants ⁣who were trying to⁤ halt the settlement while they pursued appeals.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America had filed for bankruptcy in⁢ 2020 following the enactment of laws⁤ in several U.S. states that allowed victims to sue over abuse allegations⁣ that dated back decades. The organization eventually reached a court-approved settlement in 2022, which would compensate abuse victims with amounts ranging from $3,500 to $2.7 million.\n\nThe settlement ⁤encompasses over 82,000 men who have claimed they were abused as children⁣ by troop⁤ leaders while participating ​in ​the Boy Scouts. A significant majority, over 86% of abuse survivors, voted in favor of the agreement ‍in bankruptcy court.\n\nThe 144 abuse claimants⁤ argue that the settlement unlawfully prevents them from ⁣filing lawsuits against non-bankrupt entities, such as churches that⁤ operated scouting programs, local Boy Scouts councils, and insurers ​that provided coverage to the Boy Scouts ​organization.\n\n‘A glimmer of hope’\n\nAdam Slater, an attorney representing claimants who⁣ backed the settlement, expressed relief that the Supreme Court did not further⁤ impede the Boy ‍Scouts ‍organization’s efforts to compensate abuse victims.\n\n“Given that more than 12,400 ‍survivors in this case are over the age of ⁤70 and more ⁢than ⁤2,200⁤ are over the age of 80, these courageous individuals deserve to receive compensation within their lifetimes,” Slater ⁤stated.\n\nGilion Dumas, an attorney representing 67 of the men who have​ appealed, noted that “the longer this (legal⁢ process) goes on, the⁣ harder⁣ it‍ becomes ‍to ⁢reverse” the settlement.\n\n“Securing a Supreme Court stay in a civil case was always a long shot,” Dumas admitted. ⁣”However, we‍ were determined to exhaust all possible avenues to preserve our appeal.”\n\nTheir appeal is scheduled⁢ to be heard ⁣by the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on ‌April 9.\n\n‘An ⁤emotional rollercoaster’\n\nThe men who have appealed the settlement have ⁤argued that the Boy Scouts case ⁣should remain​ on hold until the Supreme Court ​determines whether‍ U.S. bankruptcy courts have the authority to dismiss legal claims against non-bankrupt individuals and organizations. This issue‍ is currently being considered by the justices⁤ in a case involving the bankruptcy ⁢of ‌OxyContin manufacturer‌ Purdue Pharma.\n\nThe Supreme Court will decide whether the owners​ of ⁢Purdue Pharma, members of the affluent⁣ Sackler family, ⁤can be granted immunity in exchange for paying up to $6 billion ​to settle thousands of⁤ lawsuits⁣ over the company’s alleged deceptive marketing of its potent pain medication.\n\nRetired‍ bankruptcy judge ⁤Barbara Houser, the ‌trustee ‌responsible for administering the Boy Scouts settlement, announced following the Supreme Court’s decision that she has “resumed all‌ operations, ⁤including the evaluation and payment‍ of claims.” The settlement trust ⁤has already disbursed ​nearly $8 million to ‍more than 3,000 abuse claimants.\n\nThe⁢ Boy Scouts expressed⁣ their approval‌ of ⁣the Supreme Court’s decision.\n\n“This‍ decision allows the trustee to resume her crucial work ‍of compensating survivors, and it provides a path for the BSA to continue its mission of delivering scouting to more than a million young ‍men and women⁣ across the country,” the organization stated.\n\nDouglas Kennedy, an‌ abuse survivor who co-led ‌the official committee representing ‍abuse claimants in the bankruptcy, described ⁢the Supreme Court’s swift ‍decision as good news, but acknowledged that it still represented “another emotionally wrenching twist” in the survivors’ years-long⁤ pursuit ⁤of closure.\n\n“We remain on ​tenterhooks waiting to see what the final resolution will be in the Purdue⁣ case,” Kennedy ⁣said.",

        "content": "From SANTA FE, N.M. — The chief ‌armorer for the⁢ film “Rust,” Hannah Gutierrez, was held accountable ⁤by a New Mexico prosecutor on Thursday⁣ for the tragic shooting ​incident that took⁢ place on the set in 2021, leading to the death of ⁢the‍ film’s cinematographer. However, her attorney argued that she was being unfairly⁢ blamed for the unfortunate event.\n\nDuring the opening statements of⁣ her involuntary manslaughter trial, Gutierrez,​ aged 27, maintained a calm demeanor. ‌She‍ stands accused of⁢ introducing​ live ammunition on the ‍film set,⁢ a practice that has⁤ been strictly prohibited for almost a hundred years.\n\nDespite pleading not guilty, Gutierrez’s legal‌ team informed ‍the jury, ​consisting of five women and seven men,‌ that she was being held responsible for a disorganized, low-budget production. They​ argued that she was overworked, her requests for additional firearms training were disregarded, and actor Alec Baldwin violated fundamental gun safety ⁣protocols by aiming the revolver at a person and firing.\n\nThe⁢ fatal shooting of Hutchins​ occurred when Baldwin‍ was practicing with a replica Colt .45 “Peacemaker” revolver, loaded with ⁤a ⁢live round by Gutierrez, on the Santa ‌Fe film set. Director ‍Joel Souza, who‍ was ‌also injured in the incident, survived.\n\nCharges against ‌Baldwin were initially dropped​ in April, only to be reinstated on January 19. His legal team is pushing for a ‍trial in June. Baldwin, who also served as a producer on ⁣”Rust,”⁢ has denied ⁣any culpability, claiming that‌ the gun discharged without him pulling the trigger and ‌that weapons safety was ​not ⁣his responsibility.\n\nHowever, both an FBI‍ and ⁣an independent examination of⁤ the revolver concluded that it could not fire without the trigger being pulled.\n\n“They’re attempting to pin the entire blame on Hannah, who was only 24 at the time of the shooting, because​ she’s an easy target — she’s the ​least influential person on⁢ that set,” stated Gutierrez’s attorney,‌ Jason Bowles, during his opening statement.\n\n‘Negligent and Unprofessional’\n\nThe tragic incident marked the ⁤first on-set fatal shooting since actor Brandon Lee, the 28-year-old son‌ of the late martial artist and ‍actor Bruce Lee, was killed ​in 1993 during a film shoot.\n\nA state prosecutor from New Mexico labeled ‌Gutierrez’s work as “negligent and unprofessional,” ⁢alleging that she often neglected firearm safety checks.\n\n“We believe that the ⁢negligent actions and failures‌ of ​the defendant, Miss Gutierrez, led to Miss Hutchins’ death and the introduction of live rounds on the ‍set,” stated special prosecutor Jason Lewis, who was appointed nearly a year ago after two predecessors resigned due to a series of legal errors.\n\nGutierrez ‌has pleaded not guilty to the manslaughter charge and⁣ an additional charge of evidence tampering for allegedly passing a bag of cocaine to a crew ‌member on⁢ October 21, 2021, after the shooting to ‌prevent the police from discovering it. Each felony charge carries a potential prison sentence of up⁣ to 18 months.\n\nLewis presented photos of live rounds​ found‌ on the set as⁢ evidence, stating that they should have been easily identifiable due to their shiny nickel primers, or end caps, in contrast to​ the dull brass⁣ primers and⁣ aged appearance of the dummy ⁣rounds. He added that dummy ⁢rounds had holes in the side or ball ⁤bearings inside that ⁢would rattle when shaken.\n\nBowles refuted this, stating that many dummy rounds⁣ on the set also had nickel primers and some lacked ball bearings,‍ making them indistinguishable from live rounds.\n\nHe accused props supplier Seth Kenney of introducing ‍the live ⁤rounds to the set and props master Sarah Zachary, who was employed by⁣ Kenney, of tampering with the crime scene by discarding evidence ‍after the shooting.\n\nNeither Kenney ⁢nor Zachary have been charged,​ and prosecutors have stated ⁢that there is no evidence to suggest⁣ that Kenney supplied live rounds. Both are listed⁤ as potential witnesses⁣ by the prosecution and defense.\n\nNicholas LeFleur, a‌ Santa Fe police officer ​and one of the first law enforcement officials to ‍arrive⁤ at the scene after the shooting, ⁢testified in court about a ‍chaotic scene where securing evidence was challenging and⁣ a lawyer​ for the production company was conversing with witnesses.",

        "content": "HOUSTON — A lunar lander named Odysseus, constructed by Houston’s⁣ own Intuitive Machines, successfully entered the ⁣moon’s orbit on Wednesday. This marks a significant step towards ‌the first U.S. landing on our closest celestial body in over half a century, and the first ever by⁢ a privately-owned spacecraft.\n\nThe Nova-C lander, affectionately known as⁢ Odysseus, achieved a circular orbit ​57 miles above the moon’s surface. This was accomplished by firing its main rocket thruster for nearly seven⁤ minutes, as detailed in ⁢the company’s online statement.\n\nProvided everything proceeds as planned, the robotic spacecraft is set ⁤to gradually lower its orbit within the next 24 ⁤hours. It is scheduled to touch down ⁢at crater Malapert A, located near the‌ moon’s south pole, at 3:49 p.m. on​ Thursday. The⁣ lander carries a variety of NASA science instruments and⁢ technology demonstrations.\n\nAccording to Intuitive Machines, Odysseus is “in excellent health.” Throughout its lunar orbit, which is approximately 239,000 miles ⁤from Earth, mission controllers in Houston will keep ⁣a close eye on the spacecraft’s flight data and transmit images of the ​moon.\n\nOdysseus was launched on Feb. 15, just six days ago, ⁣aboard a Falcon ‌9 rocket. This‍ rocket was constructed and launched by SpaceX, Elon Musk’s California-based company, from NASA’s ⁣Kennedy ​Space Center in ⁢Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nShould the landing ‍be successful, the IM-1 mission will be the first controlled descent to the lunar⁢ surface by a U.S. spacecraft since Apollo 17. This‍ was NASA’s last crewed moon mission, which saw Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt⁢ land on the moon in 1972.\n\nThis would also be the first “soft landing” ⁣on the moon by a commercially⁣ manufactured and operated vehicle. It would also be the first ⁤under NASA’s Artemis lunar program, as ⁣the‌ U.S. competes to return astronauts to the moon before China lands its own crewed spacecraft ⁢there.\n\nThe IM-1 mission ⁤follows a setback experienced by‍ another company, Astrobotic Technology, whose lunar‌ lander ‌suffered a propulsion system leak ⁤en route ⁢to the‍ moon. This‌ occurred shortly after‍ being placed in orbit on Jan. 8 by a⁣ United‌ Launch Alliance Vulcan rocket on its maiden‍ flight.\n\nThe failure of Astrobotic’s Peregrine ⁣lander, which was also carrying NASA payloads to the moon, marked the third time a private company had failed to achieve a lunar touchdown. ⁣Previous unsuccessful attempts were made by⁤ companies from ‍Israel and Japan.\n\nThese incidents highlight the risks ⁣NASA faces as it increasingly relies on the ⁢commercial sector to achieve its ⁤spaceflight goals.\n\nDespite being⁢ an ⁢Intuitive Machines mission, the IM-1 flight is carrying‍ six NASA payloads. These instruments are designed to gather data about​ the lunar‍ environment in preparation for NASA’s‌ planned first crewed Artemis mission to⁣ the moon later this decade.\n\nIntuitive Machines was co-founded in‌ 2013 by Stephen ‌Altemus,‍ former deputy director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston and ⁣now the ​company’s president ​and CEO.\n\nNASA‌ announced last ‌month ‌that it was delaying​ its ⁣target date⁢ for a crewed Artemis moon landing from 2025 to late 2026, while‌ China has⁤ said it​ was‌ aiming for 2030.\n\nSmall landers like Nova-C are expected ⁣to reach the moon first, ‌carrying instruments to closely survey the lunar landscape, its resources, and potential hazards. Odysseus will focus on space weather interactions with the moon’s ‍surface, radio astronomy, precision landing technologies, and navigation.\n\nSo far, only spacecraft from five countries have‍ ever landed on the moon — the United⁣ States,‍ the former Soviet Union, China, ‌India, and, most ‌recently, ​Japan.\n\nrnrn",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — On Tuesday, the Supreme Court chose not to rule on the issue of excluding jurors based on their religious beliefs. This decision ​came in response to a Missouri agency’s attempt to overturn a victory by a lesbian employee in a workplace discrimination lawsuit.​ The case involved the exclusion of three potential jurors who,⁤ citing their Christian faith, expressed the⁢ belief that homosexuality is sinful.\n\nThe state ​officials ‍had sought a retrial after a lower court ​rejected their appeal.⁤ This followed a jury verdict⁢ in favor of ⁢the plaintiff, Jean Finney, in⁤ her lawsuit against the ​Missouri ⁤Department of Corrections. The state contended that the⁣ exclusion⁢ of the three individuals, who had voiced their religious opinions, contravened the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection under the law.\n\nFinney, a ⁤lesbian, filed a ‌lawsuit ​against the Department‍ of Corrections, her employer for many years. She alleged that she had been subjected​ to a pattern of ⁤workplace​ discrimination and retaliation after she ⁣started dating a male colleague’s ex-wife. Finney, who was seeking financial compensation, ⁣accused the agency of breaching Missouri’s human rights laws by fostering a hostile work environment‌ and discriminating against her based on her sex.\n\nIn‌ 2021, the ​jury ruled in Finney’s favor, awarding her a total of $275,000 for her ​claims of sexual discrimination and a hostile ‍work environment.\n\nDuring ⁣the jury‍ selection process, where potential⁢ jurors ⁢are questioned to uncover any potential bias, Finney’s attorney asked⁤ about their religious beliefs. This was ⁢done ‍in an attempt to “identify ⁣persons​ with strong feelings on the subject of homosexuality,” according to court documents submitted by Finney’s legal team.\n\nFinney’s lawyers requested‍ that Missouri state Judge Kate Schaefer dismiss the three jurors. They believed that the jurors’ responses to questions about whether homosexuality is a sin indicated a bias against gay individuals.\n\nJudge Schaefer stated that two of ​the ‌three jurors in question had been “very⁢ clear in ⁢that they could be absolutely fair and impartial in this case.”⁤ However, she agreed⁣ to exclude the ‌jurors to “err on ⁣the side of ‍caution.”\n\nThe judge approved the request despite⁢ an objection from Missouri officials.‍ Their attorneys expressed concerns about “getting into the⁣ bounds of religious discrimination” during the‌ jury selection ​process.\n\nFollowing the state’s ‍appeal, a‍ Missouri appellate⁤ court ⁢determined that the trial court had ​acted⁤ within the law. The court found that the​ dismissal of the potential jurors was based on their views on⁤ homosexuality⁣ — a “central issue in the case” — and not because they were Christians, ‌as ⁢Missouri officials had argued. After Missouri’s highest court rejected a ⁢subsequent appeal by state ⁤officials, they appealed to the Supreme ‌Court.\n\nMissouri officials argued to the justices that equal protection rights, which safeguard​ potential jurors from being dismissed based ⁣on sex or race, should also apply to religion. ⁣They ⁢added that the U.S. Constitution “ought not to tolerate exclusion on the basis‍ of religion, the very first ⁢freedom protected by the Bill ‍of Rights.”\n\nState officials admitted that⁣ potential jurors could be excluded ‍if specific religious beliefs, rather ⁣than simply the religion they follow, caused them to be biased.\n\nThe Supreme‍ Court, which has a 6-3 ​conservative majority, has recently adopted a⁢ broad interpretation of religious interests. This includes a decision last ⁢year that allowed an evangelical ‌Christian web design business owner to ⁤refuse‍ to ​provide ⁢services for ⁢same-sex‌ weddings.\n\nIn 2022, the court sided with a‌ public high school‌ football coach who was suspended for refusing to stop leading Christian prayers with players on the field after games.",

        "content": "SALT LAKE CITY — Parents of college-bound students are ⁤discovering​ that⁤ the ‌process of filling out financial aid applications can be a bit of a headache. The new Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which was‍ intended to simplify the process and expand access to college,‌ has proven to be more challenging than anticipated.\n\nMoreover, parents who will have multiple children in college during the 2024-25 academic year may be in for‌ a surprise when it comes to the​ cost.\n\nAs reported by CNN, “The FAFSA used to consist of as many as 108⁤ questions. However, with the new form, some applicants⁤ will only need to answer a minimum of 18 questions, which should take less than 10 minutes to complete, according to the ⁤Department of Education. Some data is now directly extracted from a filer’s tax return, eliminating the need for applicants to search for figures on old tax ⁣returns.”\n\nIt is projected that an additional ⁢1.5 million students will be eligible for the maximum Pell grant award, which ‍currently stands ⁢at $7,395 per annum.\n\nWhat’s new with ⁣FAFSA\n\nThe revised form now uses a student aid index, which can be⁢ either beneficial or detrimental for families, depending on ‍their income. As CNBC noted, “The new system will allow more low- and moderate-income students to access​ federal grants, but it will also reduce eligibility for some wealthier families.”\n\nFamilies with more than one⁤ student in college in 2024-2025 may experience additional financial pressure. The so-called “sibling discount,” which previously provided relief for families with two or ‍more children in college simultaneously, has been discontinued.\n\nInstead of dividing the expected ​family contribution to ‌college costs by the number of children in college, each child applying will receive an individual expected ⁤family contribution. This means that financial aid award letters ‌may not meet the expectations of some parents and students.\n\nHowever, Menaka Hampole, assistant professor of finance at Yale School of Management, told CNBC that this ​creates a “strong case” for appealing the award. She and other⁣ experts suggest that schools are often open to providing more aid on appeal, but families are frequently unaware ‌of‍ this.\n\nThe first step is ⁣to contact a school’s financial aid office and inquire about how to appeal a decision. Additionally,​ if another school has made a more attractive offer, a school may be willing to adjust its aid offer.\n\nRollout complications\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education has reported that only 4 million students had submitted ⁢their form by the end ‌of January, a small fraction of⁣ the 17 million typically submitted‍ in ‌a⁤ normal year. Most​ applications are usually completed by this time in a typical year.\n\nOn Monday, Feb. 12, the Los Angeles Times reported that “high school seniors and their‌ counselors are describing the situation as chaotic, disastrous, and frightening.”\n\nThe article mentioned that “sometimes parents and students would complete the form, but the system would not allow them to create an account, citing an error without ⁤specifying what​ it was. Those who didn’t complete the form on the first attempt or needed to correct ⁢a mistake were locked out.”\n\nParents without a Social Security number have often been unable ​to submit a form for their children, even if their children have Social Security numbers.⁤ And if someone filling out a form made any⁣ mistake — even⁤ a simple typo — they have to wait to correct it, further delaying their application.⁤ The FAFSA portal will not open for corrections​ until mid-March.\n\nMultiple news outlets have reported on students who have been trying unsuccessfully for weeks, and in some cases a month, to submit their federal financial aid form. Those who attempted to call the U.S. Department of Education’s help line often couldn’t get through or faced extremely long wait times to speak to a representative.\n\nDemands for action\n\nThe problematic process has caught the ‍attention of over 100 Democratic ​lawmakers, who have⁢ written to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, urging him to address the issues and ⁤streamline the process, as reported ​by The Washington Post⁢ and other media outlets. “Lawmakers are seeking clarity on how the ⁣department⁢ plans to communicate any further delays in processing the FAFSA and minimize the potential impact on students.”\n\nRepublican lawmakers are calling for the Government Accountability Office to investigate. The Post‌ quoted Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., chairwoman of the House Education Committee: “The reason students, parents, and⁢ schools ⁤are scrambling to deal with financial aid uncertainty is because of gross mismanagement by the department.”\n\nDue to the government’s delays in the financial aid process,⁣ schools ⁣like the University of California‍ and California State University have extended their deadlines for first-year students to accept their admission offers for the fall.\n\nAdjusting deadlines, reducing requirements\n\nIn a call with reporters, Cardona stated⁤ that his department is⁢ reducing some⁣ of the verification burden it places on colleges and universities so they can concentrate on processing and delivering student aid. The schools have traditionally had to verify income and⁤ other information on a percentage of applications as well as vet their own⁢ processes. ⁣That burden will be lighter for the time being.\n\n“Here’s the ‍bottom line: Fewer requirements for colleges and universities this spring means more time and resources freed up to deliver financial aid for‍ students to make the most of the improved FAFSA,” Cardona said.\n\nThe⁢ department made the new FAFSA available three months later than planned. And it now doesn’t plan to send students’ application information to the schools until March, which puts those ⁢schools behind in assigning​ financial ⁤aid and getting students to commit.\n\nInside Higher⁣ Education reported that “college⁢ officials were underwhelmed by the department’s initial support plan, which includes deploying teams of ⁣federal experts to under-resourced institutions.”‌ It reported that starting ⁢last week, the department selected institutions⁢ for‍ the additional help, using a number of criteria such as the percentage of ​students​ eligible⁢ for Pell grants.",

        "image": "https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3775-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg",
        "content": "Deep⁣ in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains​ in Hendersonville, N.C., a rust-hued stingray ‌named Charlotte, as large‌ as a dinner plate, has⁤ spent the majority of her life gracefully‌ navigating ⁣the waters of a ​local aquarium. Despite being ⁢a staggering 2,300 miles away from her natural home⁢ in the southern Californian ​waves, and having not encountered a male of her species for at least eight years, Charlotte is‌ miraculously⁣ pregnant.\n\n“Our beloved Charlotte is sending us a Valentine’s Day ⁣surprise by preparing to welcome some pups!” exclaimed Brenda Ramer, the executive director⁣ of the Aquarium and‌ Shark Lab⁢ located on Main Street in downtown Hendersonville.\n\nContrary to some media reports, Charlotte’s pregnancy is not the result of an unlikely interspecies romance with one of ⁤the five small sharks she shares her tank with. This was a playful suggestion made​ by‍ Ramer, but ​experts have⁣ confirmed that such a scenario ⁤would be impossible.\n\nThe aquarium, managed by Ramer’s ⁣educational nonprofit, Team ECCO, aims to⁣ inspire local schoolchildren and the wider⁤ community ⁤to develop ⁤a passion for science. Currently, the most significant lesson being taught is about parthenogenesis, a form of asexual reproduction where offspring develop from unfertilized eggs, eliminating the need for a male’s ⁢genetic contribution.\n\nThis rare phenomenon has been observed in certain insects, fish, amphibians, birds, ⁢and reptiles, but never in mammals. Documented instances include California condors, Komodo dragons, and yellow-bellied water snakes.\n\nKady Lyons, ⁢a research scientist at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, who is not affiliated with ⁢the North Carolina aquarium, stated that Charlotte’s pregnancy is the only known case of parthenogenesis in ‌round stingrays. However, ‌she is not surprised, as other types of sharks, skates, ⁣and rays have experienced similar pregnancies in ​captivity.\n\n“Nature has a way of making this happen,” Lyons said. “These animals are not cloning themselves. Instead, a female’s ‍egg fuses with another cell,⁢ triggering cell division and ⁤leading to‍ the creation of ⁣an embryo.”\n\nThe cell that fuses⁣ with the egg is known as a polar body. They are produced when a female ⁤is creating an egg but usually aren’t used. “We don’t know why it happens,”⁢ Lyons said. “Just that⁤ it’s kind ⁤of ‍this really neat phenomenon that they seem to be able to do.”\n\nInitially, Ramer and her team thought Charlotte had a tumor when they noticed a⁤ lump on her back that was “blowing up‌ like a biscuit.” However, an ultrasound revealed her pregnancy. “We were⁣ all ‌like, ‘Shut the back door. There’s no way,” Ramer said. “We thought we were overfeeding her. But we were overfeeding‍ her because she has more mouths to feed.”\n\nCharlotte currently resides in a tank that holds ‌about 2,200 gallons, roughly the size of ​a construction dumpster. Ramer hopes to acquire a tank⁢ nearly twice that size to accommodate Charlotte’s offspring. They ​also plan to install live cameras for people to ⁢observe them.\n\n“It is very‌ rare to happen,” Ramer said. “But it’s happening in the middle of the Blue Ridge‍ Mountains in rural North Carolina, hundreds of miles from the ocean.”\n\nAs for the suggestion that Charlotte could have been impregnated by a shark, Lyons said that’s impossible.⁢ Besides being different ​sizes, the animals wouldn’t match up anatomically. ⁣Neither would their DNA.\n\n“We should ‌set the record straight that there aren’t some shark-ray shenanigans happening here,” said Lyons, whose graduate work focused ⁤on the species.\n\nRound stingrays like Charlotte are abundant on the Pacific coasts of southern California and Mexico, often resting on⁢ the ocean’s ⁢sandy bottom near the shoreline. They ⁣are typically the size of⁢ a​ small ‌dinner plate, and their name comes from their circular shape. They come in‍ all shades of ⁣brown. They eat small worms, crabs, and mollusks, and ​they ⁢are preyed upon by⁢ certain types of sharks, seals, and giant sea bass.\n\nThey’re well ‌known to humans because of their painful sting, often resulting from a beachgoer’s foot ⁢stepping on them. Southern California lifeguards ‌encourage people to do ​the so-called stingray shuffle as they wade through the water, in large⁢ part⁣ because of round‍ stingrays.\n\nLyons finds the species fascinating. For example, embryos ⁣in the ‍womb are bathed in⁤ uterine milk that provides⁤ nutrients to help them develop.\n\n“I’m⁢ glad the round stingray is getting ⁣the media attention‍ that it deserves,” Lyons said. “It’s not necessarily as sexy​ as a white shark, but they do a lot ​of really neat stuff.”",

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal ⁢Apprehension is currently investigating the incident, with Superintendent Drew ⁢Evans confirming that there ‌was an exchange of gunfire.\n\nThe firefighter and paramedic who lost his life was attending to an injured officer when he was fatally shot. Superintendent Evans revealed during a press conference that the paramedic was part of a SWAT team that had been dispatched to handle a domestic situation.\n\nThe‌ incident ⁢began when officers responded to a call about an armed man who had barricaded himself inside a home with his family, including seven children. Thankfully,⁣ the family was able to escape the home​ unharmed.\n\nThe exact circumstances surrounding the suspect’s death have not yet been disclosed. The suburban neighborhood​ where⁣ the incident took place was cordoned off with police cars, keeping the media and⁤ public at a‌ safe⁤ distance.\n\nCity⁣ officials released a statement explaining that the⁣ incident began as ‍a domestic situation report.

        "content": "MOSCOW, Russia — The spokesperson⁣ for⁣ Alexei ⁢Navalny, a ​prominent figure in the Russian opposition, confirmed on Saturday that Navalny had tragically passed away ‌at a remote Arctic penal colony. The spokesperson went on to⁤ claim that Navalny was ⁣”murdered,” but the‍ location of his body remains unknown as his loved ones desperately seek ​answers.\n\nAt the age of​ 47, Navalny’s untimely death has left a gaping hole in the Russian​ opposition, just weeks before an election that is expected⁢ to extend ​President Vladimir Putin’s​ reign for another six‍ years.\n\nDespite the fact that neither Navalny, a staunch anti-corruption‌ advocate, nor other critics of ⁤the Kremlin were in a position to challenge Putin for the presidency, Navalny’s death is a devastating blow​ to those Russians who ⁤had placed their hopes for a brighter future on this⁤ seemingly⁢ tireless adversary of Putin. His‌ sudden death has ⁢also sparked questions about the cause. Russian officials informed Navalny’s team on Saturday that the cause of his death was still under investigation, with the results expected⁣ to be released next week, according to Navalny’s spokesperson,⁤ Kira‌ Yarmysh. Navalny’s mother was⁣ informed that the ​body would​ not be released ‍until the investigations were concluded, leading to speculation ‍that the ​Russian ⁢authorities may be ​attempting to conceal any evidence​ of foul⁤ play. “They’re leading us on​ a wild goose chase and covering their tracks,”​ Yarmysh stated.\n\nYarmysh revealed‌ that a note handed to ⁢Navalny’s mother⁣ stated that he died at 2:17 p.m.‍ on Friday. Prison⁢ officials informed his mother upon her arrival at ⁣the penal colony on Saturday that her son had succumbed to “sudden death syndrome,” according to Ivan Zhdanov, ⁢the director of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, who posted ⁣the information on X, formerly⁣ known as Twitter.\n\nYarmysh also stated that a prison colony employee informed them that the body ‌had been transported to the nearby city of Salekhard for ⁢a post-mortem investigation. However, when Navalny’s mother and one of his lawyers visited the morgue‌ in Salekhard, they⁤ found it closed, according​ to a post⁣ on Navalny’s team’s Telegram channel. The ⁤lawyer called the morgue and was told‌ that the body⁢ was not there.\n\nAnother of Navalny’s lawyers visited Salekhard’s Investigative Committee and was ⁢told that the cause of Navalny’s death was still ⁢under investigation, with the results expected to be released next ⁣week. The Investigative Committee also informed Navalny’s team ⁢that‌ the body‌ would not‍ be released to his family ​until the ​investigations were concluded.\n\n“It’s clear that they are lying and ‍doing everything in their power to avoid releasing the body,” Yarmysh posted on X,⁤ adding that his team demanded that Navalny’s body “be immediately released to ​his family.”\n\nThe Federal Penitentiary Service in Russia reported⁤ that ⁢Navalny fell ill ⁣after a walk on Friday and lost ​consciousness ⁢at⁣ the penal colony in the town of Kharp, in the Yamalo-Nenets region, approximately 1,200 miles⁤ northeast of Moscow. An ambulance was called, but they were unable to revive him. The service added that the‍ cause of death is still “being established.”\n\nMaria⁣ Pevchikh, the head⁢ of the board of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, stated that the opposition leader would ​”live on forever in ⁢millions of‌ hearts.”\n\n“Navalny was murdered. We still don’t know how we’ll continue living, but together, we’ll figure‍ something out,” she ​posted on X.\n\nMeanwhile, arrests continued on Saturday as Russians gathered to lay flowers in memory of Navalny at memorials dedicated to the ⁣victims of Soviet-era‍ purges. OVD-Info, a group that⁢ monitors political⁤ repression in Russia, reported on Saturday that more than 273 people had been detained at memorial events since Navalny’s death.\n\nMemorial items laid on Friday were⁣ removed overnight, but​ people continued⁣ to arrive with flowers on Saturday. In Moscow, a large crowd chanted ⁣”shame” as police forcibly removed a woman from the crowd, as seen​ in ‌a ⁤video shared on social ⁤media.\n\nMore than​ 10 people were detained⁤ at⁢ a memorial in St. Petersburg, including a priest⁣ who had come to conduct ‍a service ​for Navalny.\n\nIn other cities across the country, police cordoned off some of the ​memorials and officers were seen taking photographs of those who ‌came and recording their personal data in an apparent⁢ attempt at intimidation.\n\n“After the murder of Alexei Navalny, it’s⁢ absurd to perceive Putin as the supposedly legitimate head of the Russian state,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ⁢stated at the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Saturday. “He ‌is a thug who maintains power through corruption and violence.”\n\nU.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron stated‍ on Saturday that Britain “will be taking action” against the Russians responsible for Navalny’s​ death.\n\nSpeaking⁣ to broadcasters in Munich, Cameron stated that “there⁢ should be consequences” for “appalling human rights outrages like this.” He said Britain would “look at whether there are individual ⁢people that are responsible and whether there​ are individual measures and actions we can take.” Cameron did not ​specify whether the response would involve ⁢financial sanctions or other measures.\n\nPresident Joe Biden stated on Friday that ⁣Washington doesn’t know exactly what happened,‌ “but‌ there is no doubt that the death of Navalny was⁢ a consequence of something Putin and his thugs did.”\n\nThe Kremlin ⁣reacted angrily on Friday to the outpouring of anger from world leaders, with Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry ⁣Peskov, describing the statements — issued before‍ medics ⁢have released the ⁣cause of Navalny’s death —‍ as “unacceptable” and “outrageous.”\n\nNavalny had been imprisoned since January 2021, when he returned to Moscow after recovering in Germany from ⁤nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin.⁣ He was later convicted three times, claiming each case was politically⁤ motivated, and received a ⁢sentence of 19 years for extremism.\n\nAfter the last verdict, Navalny⁢ stated that he understood ‍he was “serving a life sentence, which is measured by the length ‍of my​ life or the‍ length of‍ life of this regime.”\n\nNigel Gould-Davies, a former British ambassador to Belarus and senior fellow for Russia & Eurasia ⁢at the⁢ International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, stated that the loss of‌ Navalny shows that “the sentence in Russia now⁢ for ​opposition is not merely imprisonment, ⁤but death.”\n\nHours after the news of Navalny’s death was reported, his wife, Yulia Navalnaya, made ⁣a dramatic appearance at ⁣the Munich conference.\n\nShe stated that‌ she was unsure if she could believe​ the news from official Russian‌ sources, “but if this ‍is ​true, I want Putin and everyone ‍around ​Putin, Putin’s friends, his government to ​know that they ⁤will bear responsibility for what they did to our country, to⁣ my family and to my ⁢husband.”",

This verdict, which ‍also prohibits Trump from serving on the ⁣board of any New York company, follows a three-month-long civil fraud trial ⁣over allegations of exaggerated⁣ and fraudulent financial statements from his company.\n\nTrump has⁣ been indicted four times ​and faces other criminal charges related to hush-money payments, withholding classified documents‍ after leaving office, and attempting ‌to overturn the 2020 election result.\n\n“The ‍legal challenges that former President Trump faces will be resolved in⁣ the courts,” Romney ⁤said, adding, ⁤”I’m sure⁢ he will appeal extensively.”\n\nRomney reaffirmed his stance: “Some might consider me old-fashioned, but I draw‌ the line at sexual assault when considering​ who ‍I⁣ want as president of the United States,” he said, referring to a civil case against Trump brought by writer ‌E. Jean Carroll, in which⁢ a jury found ​Trump liable for defamation and sexual abuse.\n\nRelated:\nRomney ‘not going to run for president,’ dismisses Manchin rumors\n\nHe further stated that ⁤while he does not support​ Trump, he agrees with ⁤many of his policies.\n\n“I frequently voted‍ with⁢ him ⁤when he was president and I ‌was serving ⁤in the Senate, actually more often than ‌many others,” Romney said. “But when it comes to character,‍ in my view, he is not the kind of individual ‌you want representing the greatest nation on Earth.”\n\nRomney confessed that he was unsure about his vote in this year’s presidential election. In the past, he voted for his wife, Ann, ⁤primarily because they resided⁣ in Utah, a ​staunchly‍ red ⁢state. ⁣”If we⁤ were ​in Georgia or Michigan or somewhere else, I’m not sure what⁢ I would do.”\n\nRomney’s Reaction to the Death of Alexei Navalny\n\nDuring the press ⁣conference, Romney was asked about his⁤ reaction ⁤to the death of Russian opposition‌ leader ⁣Alexei Navalny,​ who passed away in prison on Friday.\n\nNavalny⁢ was‍ a vocal critic⁢ of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n“This ​is yet another day that⁢ highlights the fact that Vladimir‌ Putin is not a good person, but⁣ an evil⁢ one,” Romney declared. “Not only did ⁢he brutally invade a sovereign nation, Ukraine, and attempt⁢ to seize ⁤its⁣ capital and take over the country, but ⁤he also ruthlessly murders people within his own⁢ country.”\n\nRomney commented⁣ on the premature deaths of many of Putin’s opponents, including Navalny.\n\n“It’s appalling that the world does not recognize that Vladimir Putin ​is a‍ very​ bad person. And I’m proud to be part of a ​nation where we have‌ disagreements, but where we respect one another, respect the rule of law,​ and do not tolerate the kind of brutality that you’re seeing at the hands of Vladimir Putin.”",

        "image": "https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3733-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg",
        "content": "From the heart ‌of SALT LAKE CITY, a​ recent report reveals ‌that adults residing alone are more prone to feelings ‌of⁢ depression compared to ​those sharing their‌ living space. However, the percentage is relatively small, as ⁢per ⁣the data from a National Health ‍Statistics Report ⁤published this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe study discovered that the highest levels of depression were reported by individuals ​who felt they lacked sufficient social​ and emotional support. ⁢This data was gathered from a nationally representative survey conducted in​ 2021 as part of the⁣ annual National Health ⁤Interview Survey.\n\nAccording to ‌the findings, for every 16 individuals living alone, one reported feelings of‍ depression.‌ This rate‍ is higher than the 1 in 25 individuals living ⁢with others who‍ reported feeling ⁤depressed.\n\n“The most⁤ intriguing aspect of this study is the emphasis ​on the importance of feeling supported,” ⁢said social scientist⁢ Kasley Killam, who was not involved in the study. “This aligns⁤ with other evidence​ that suggests social and emotional support play a ‍crucial role ‌in overall health and⁢ well-being.”\n\nInterestingly, a significant⁤ portion of households ​in‌ the U.S. are single-person, with nearly⁤ 38 million people living ⁢alone. A Census‍ report from June 2023 indicates that 27.6% ⁣of all U.S. occupied households were single-person in 2020, a significant increase from just 7.7% in 1940.\n\nThe recent report, ⁢however, presents a lower figure, stating that in ​2021, 16% of all adults lived ‌alone. It also highlighted that those living ⁣alone were generally ‌older, with ‌nearly⁤ 40% aged 65 and ⁢above, compared to​ just 19% of those living with‍ others.\n\nWho Prefers Solitude?\n\nThe report indicates that counties ‌with the highest percentage of single-person⁢ households were primarily in‍ the​ Midwest, ‍Alabama, and Mississippi.​ Conversely, most counties​ in Alaska and Utah had low ‍percentages of single-person households. Older​ adults living ​alone was⁢ more common in rural counties than in urban ones.\n\nWhen respondents were asked about ⁤the levels of social⁤ and‌ emotional support in ⁤their lives, those living alone and receiving little or no social and emotional support⁤ were the most likely to report feelings of​ depression.\n\nInterestingly, the study ‌found no⁤ difference in depression levels between those living alone and those living with others, provided they felt they had adequate social and emotional ⁤support.\n\nLaryssa Mykyta, the study author, found ⁢this to be the “most compelling ⁤and most interesting”‌ finding, as it underscores the importance of ⁢social and emotional⁤ support for ⁢overall well-being and ​mood.\n\nA Persistent Trend\n\nLoneliness and social isolation have long been recognized as ‌significant social and⁣ emotional issues that can lead to anxiety and depression. In 2018, Deseret‍ News highlighted ⁣the rise in anxiety and depression among American teens in a ‍series titled ⁣”Generation Vexed.”\n\nA decade ago, Deseret News explored loneliness​ among refugee women, older Americans, and ⁢parents of children with severe disabilities in a series ⁢called “Living‍ Lonely.”\n\nMore recently, Deseret News reported on Surgeon General Vivek Murthy’s advisory on loneliness and social isolation as a‌ public health crisis, particularly affecting youths. Murthy’s urgent public health advisory highlighted the​ pandemic’s exacerbation of these issues.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that living‍ alone does not ⁢necessarily equate ⁢to loneliness or⁢ depression. The report emphasizes that some individuals⁤ may choose to live alone without ⁢experiencing ‌negative effects on their physical and mental health. Furthermore, those living alone may be actively engaged in their work or communities and may ‌have‌ access to social networks and social and‍ emotional support that can ⁣protect their mental health.\n\nOffering and Receiving Support\n\nIt’s crucial to be‍ aware‍ of ⁣those living alone ‌in your ⁤vicinity. ​If someone ⁢appears‌ to need more social and emotional⁢ support, there⁤ are simple ways to ⁢help. VeryWell Mind identifies‌ four ‌types of social support: emotional, esteem, informational, and tangible.\n\nHere⁣ are some ways to support those who may be alone and at risk of depression:\n\nOffer⁣ physical ⁤contact,⁣ such as hugs, ⁢and spend time together.\nShow that you⁣ care by ‌checking in‌ regularly.\nValidate their emotions and offer comfort and reassurance when ⁤needed.\nBoost their self-esteem with compliments and reassurances.\nRemind them of ‌their strengths.\nProvide relevant information, such as details about nearby activities.\nOffer tangible support, like⁢ help with⁤ chores or transportation to medical appointments.\nAssist with errands.\n\nFor⁣ those who ⁣need more support,⁢ the article advises asking ⁢for help and being specific about ⁤your needs. It also suggests⁣ expanding your social circle if‌ you’re not getting the robust ⁤interactions you‌ need.",

        "content": "SEASIDE, Ore. — The cause of death of ⁢an endangered fin whale that washed ashore in Oregon remains a mystery. However, the decomposing marine giant offers a unique spectacle for beachgoers and a valuable learning opportunity.\n\n“While it’s‍ a​ tragic event, it also provides a rare educational experience,” said Tiffany Boothe, the assistant manager of the Seaside Aquarium, on Thursday. She noted ​that this is only ‍the second time in approximately 30 years that a deceased fin whale‍ has been found⁢ in Oregon.\n\nBoothe cautioned the⁢ public against⁢ touching⁢ the whale, as it could potentially carry diseases that can be transmitted to humans and pets. “And let’s not forget‌ the‌ smell,” she added. ⁤”It’s hard to put into words, but it smells exactly like what it is – a dead whale.”\n\nThe 46-foot male whale ‌was discovered on Monday morning at Sunset Beach ⁤State ‍Park, south of Warrenton, entangled​ in a rope.\n\nBefore officials could investigate the ​rope and the type of ​fishing ‌gear ⁤it was associated with, someone removed ‍it. “The person ⁣likely had good intentions, as⁢ the whale was⁣ still in the surf and appeared to ⁣be alive,” Boothe explained. “They probably thought they were helping to free a live animal.”\n\nDespite the severe entanglement, the whale ‍wasn’t ⁤trapped‍ for long, ⁣and the rope didn’t cause its ⁢death. The exact cause of death, which left the whale emaciated, will be determined in a few weeks following a necropsy conducted⁤ on Tuesday, according to Boothe.\n\nThe whale’s decomposition will naturally enrich the ‍local environment.​ “It’s a ⁤massive nutrient boost, feeding scavengers from eagles and ravens⁤ to tiny amphipods,” Boothe said.\n\nAllowing ⁢the ​whale to decompose naturally reflects a ​more informed approach ‌compared to ‍1970 when officials⁣ decided to use dynamite to ​dispose of a ⁣dead whale that washed ashore⁤ in ⁤southern Oregon. “Such⁤ an incident wouldn’t happen‍ now,” Boothe said, recalling how the explosion ⁣sent large pieces of whale carcass flying into the ‍sky and⁣ even damaged a car.",

        "content": "From the heart of KANSAS ⁢CITY, Mo. — A tragic incident unfolded amidst ⁤the sea of‍ people gathered to celebrate the Kansas City Chiefs’⁣ Super Bowl victory. A mass shooting resulted in the death of one individual and left nearly two dozen injured. The authorities, on ⁣Thursday, suggested that the incident was likely the result of a dispute among a few individuals.\n\nStacey⁢ Graves, the Kansas ⁢City Police Chief, revealed⁢ that the victims of Wednesday’s unfortunate event ranged​ from 8 to 47 years old, with half of them ⁣being under 16. A mother ‌of two was among the deceased.\n\nThe police managed⁤ to detain three individuals in connection with⁤ the shooting. However, one of ⁢them⁤ was released after being found uninvolved, leaving two juveniles in⁤ custody. No charges have been filed yet.⁣ The police are actively seeking other potential suspects and have urged witnesses, individuals with cellphone footage, and victims to come ‍forward and contact a dedicated hotline.\n\n“We are working tirelessly to determine the involvement of others. ​It’s worth mentioning that we⁢ have recovered several firearms. ​This incident is still under active investigation,” stated ⁣Graves during a press conference.\n\nThe shooting took place outside Union Station, despite⁢ the presence of over 800 police⁣ officers in the vicinity, including atop nearby structures. ‍Mayor Quinton​ Lucas, who was present at the scene with his wife and mother, had to run for safety when the shots were fired. However, he does ⁤not anticipate cancelling the upcoming St. Patrick’s ​Day parade.\n\n“We host​ parades regularly. I don’t foresee them ending. We are well aware of the public safety challenges and issues ‌associated with them,” Lucas commented.\n\nWednesday’s celebration was the third parade in four years, with the previous ones being peaceful.\n\nThe parade route was packed with fans, some even climbing trees and street poles for a‍ better​ view. The players were welcomed with DJs‍ and drummers as they rolled through on double-decker buses.\n\nGraves estimated that around 1 million people attended ‍the parade in a city with a population of about 470,000 and a metropolitan area of about⁣ 2 million. He emphasized that the violence was the act of a few individuals.\n\n“The response from law enforcement was commendable. The attendees also responded appropriately,” added Graves.\n\nTrey Filter, a 40-year-old man, was⁣ among those who responded. He was leaving the event with ⁤his family when he ⁣heard shouts of “get ‍him.”⁢ He saw a man running away ​and, along with another bystander, attempted to tackle him. Filter managed to jump on top ⁤of the⁣ man.\n\n“I don’t know what came over me,”​ recalled⁣ Filter, the owner of an asphalt and concrete company. “We were like, ‘We got him.’ I’ll always remember‍ that. And then⁣ they started screaming, ‘There’s a gun!'”\n\nThe men searched for the gun,‍ which had been knocked loose during the scuffle. The⁣ gun had⁢ fallen near Filter’s wife, Casey Filter, who‌ picked it up. At that point, ⁢the man who had fled was under a pile⁢ of people about 10 ‌feet away.\n\nAnd we all train for this, we’re all prepared to take care of these children. But it doesn’t negate the fact that it’s⁢ still not normal⁤ for people⁢ to see ⁤many, many ‍people wounded by gunshots.\n\n–Dr. Stephanie Burrus\n\nTrey Filter, ⁣who resides outside Wichita, was‍ still ‌processing the chaotic‌ event​ on‌ Thursday. But he was relieved that the situation wasn’t worse.\n\n“I’m sure there were a thousand other men there that ⁢would have ⁤done the same,” ‍he said.\n\nThe police have not identified Filter ⁢as the man who intervened‌ or ‍confirmed whether ⁣the man he tackled was ⁤a suspect.\n\nMeanwhile, the police are still urging witnesses to come forward with ‍information. Many described a wave of confusion that swept through the crowd.\n\nThe rally had just ended ⁣and music was still playing when the shots were fired. Many initially mistook the gunshots for fireworks. But then panic ensued. Some in ⁢the crowd hit the‍ ground while others jumped over barriers ‍and ran, some carrying children in their arms.\n\nThe crowd was so⁤ large‍ that normalcy returned quickly, with some fans unsure of what ‌had transpired. But then ambulances arrived and officers rushed in with guns drawn. Some of the⁢ less seriously injured were driven away on golf carts.\n\nThe shocked crowd — some in tears — slowly gathered their belongings, trying⁣ to figure out how to⁤ get home. Strangers comforted each other as police put up crime scene tape in an area where moments earlier there had been a joyous celebration.\n\nHank Hunter, a sophomore ⁢at a Kansas high school, said ⁢he heard shots in the distance while watching the rally ​with a friend. Initially, they didn’t know⁣ what it was, ⁢but then “like a chain reaction,” people ​started hitting the ⁤ground.\n\nThey ran to jump over‌ a barricade and his friend ⁢slammed his head into the‌ concrete, Hunter said. A security guard ushered his​ friend into Union Station, which was closed to the general public,⁢ as the players and coaches prepared ⁣to leave on⁤ buses. There, coach Andy Reid consoled⁤ his friend and ⁤”just ⁤tried ⁢to comfort him⁣ and‍ calm him down.”\n\nSocial media users ‌posted shocking videos of police running through Wednesday’s crowded scene. One video showed ⁣someone apparently performing chest compressions on a victim as another person,‍ seemingly writhing in pain, lay on the⁤ ground nearby. People screamed in the background.\n\nThe woman killed⁢ in the shooting was identified​ by radio station KKFI-FM as Lisa Lopez-Galvan,⁢ host of “Taste of Tejano.”\n\nLopez-Galvan,​ whose DJ name was ‌”Lisa G,”‍ was⁤ an ⁣extrovert⁢ and ‌devoted mother from a prominent Latino family ⁢in the area, said Rosa Izurieta ⁢and Martha Ramirez, ‌two childhood friends who worked with her at a staffing company.\n\n“She’s the type of person who ​would jump in front of a bullet for anybody⁤ — that would be Lisa,” Izurieta said.\n\nKansas City has long struggled with gun⁢ violence, and in 2020 it⁤ was among nine​ cities targeted by the ⁣U.S. Justice ‌Department in an effort to ‍crack down on violent⁤ crime. In 2023, the city matched a record ‌with 182 homicides, most of which involved guns.\n\nLucas‌ has joined⁤ with mayors across the country in calling for new laws to reduce gun violence, including mandating universal background checks.\n\nMeanwhile, University⁣ Health ‌Truman Medical Center reported that three ‌people with‌ gunshot wounds were⁣ still being treated there Thursday, including two in critical condition. One‌ is a man who survived only because ⁣staff got him to the operating ⁢room within five ⁤minutes of ⁤arrival, Dr. Dustin Neel said.\n\nSt. ‍Luke’s Hospital spokesperson⁤ Emily Hohenberg said one gunshot victim ​remains in critical condition there.\n\nChildren’s Mercy Kansas City said ⁣three children remain ⁣there. It had received 11 children between the ages of 6 and 15, nine of whom suffered gunshot wounds. All were ‍expected‍ to recover.\n\nStephanie Meyer, the ⁢hospital’s chief nursing officer, said at a Thursday news conference that the‍ kids are scared and will need mental health support. The hospital’s staff members‍ are also struggling.\n\n“They’re struggling just like you and I are, and​ unbelievably heartbroken that this has happened in our backyard,” said‍ Dr. Stephanie Burrus, the hospital’s chief​ wellbeing officer. “And we all train for this, we’re ​all prepared to take care of these children. But it doesn’t negate the‌ fact that it’s still not ‌normal⁣ for people to see many, many people wounded by gunshots.”",

One video ⁣showed a person performing chest compressions on ​a victim, while another person writhed in pain nearby. Another video showed two individuals chasing and tackling a suspect, holding them down until police arrived.\n\nRadio station KKFI mourned the loss ⁢of Lisa Lopez-Galvan, host of “Taste of Tejano,” who was killed in the shooting.⁢ “This senseless act has ​taken a beautiful person from her family and this KC Community,” KKFI stated.\n\nLopez-Galvan, known as “Lisa G,” was a vibrant personality and a⁢ devoted mother from a ‍well-known ‍Latino family in the area.

But 10 minutes later, ambulances started showing up.\n\n“It’s unfortunate that someone had to ruin the celebration, but we are in a big city,” Sanders ‌said.\n\nUniversity Health spokeswoman Nancy Lewis said the hospital was treating eight gunshot victims.

Mike Parson and first lady Teresa Parson were at the parade during the gunfire but were unhurt.‌ “Thanks to the professionalism of our security officers and⁤ first responders, Teresa and I and our staff are safe‍ and secure,”​ Parson said in​ a ​statement.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said the shooting “cuts deep in the American soul” and called on people to press Congress ‍to ban assault weapons, to limit high-capacity gun magazines and for other gun⁤ measures that have been rejected by Republicans.\n\n“Today’s events should move us, shock us, shame us into acting. What are we waiting for?”‌ he said.\n\nBiden noted that Wednesday was the anniversary of the 2018​ high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that killed⁣ 17 people and said there​ have​ been more mass shootings in 2024 “than there have been days in the year.”\n\nAreas that had been filled with crowds were empty after ⁣the shooting,⁤ with police and firefighters standing ⁤and talking behind an area restricted by yellow tape.\n\nThrongs had lined the route earlier, with fans climbing trees and ⁤street poles or standing on rooftops for a better view.

The background was filled with the terrified screams of ​the crowd.\n\nAnother video showed two brave individuals chasing and subduing a person, holding them down until the police arrived.\n\nKansas City has a long history of grappling with gun violence. ‍In 2020, ‌it was one of nine cities targeted by the U.S. ‌Justice Department in an effort to curb violent crime. In 2023, the⁢ city tied‌ its record with 182 ‌homicides, the majority​ of which involved firearms.\n\nMayor Quinton Lucas, along with other mayors across the country, has been advocating for new laws to reduce gun violence, including the implementation of universal background checks.\n\nLucas, who was present at the celebration with his wife and mother, expressed his heartbreak and anger over the incident. “This is an absolute tragedy, one that ⁣we never anticipated in Kansas City and one⁤ that will be remembered for a long time,” Lucas stated.\n\nLisa Money, a resident of Kansas⁤ City,‍ Kansas,⁤ was collecting confetti near the end ‌of the parade ​when‍ she heard someone shout, “Down, down,⁣ everybody down!” Initially, she⁤ thought it‌ was a joke until she saw the SWAT team jumping over the fence.\n\n“I can’t believe this actually happened. Who in their right⁢ mind would do something like this? This was supposed to⁢ be a day of celebration for everyone in the city and the ‍surrounding area.⁤ And then some⁤ idiot decides to do something like this,” she lamented.\n\nKevin Sanders, 53, of Lenexa, Kansas, heard what he initially thought ⁤were ⁤firecrackers, followed by the sound of people running. After a brief period of calm, ambulances began to arrive. “It’s unfortunate ⁢that someone had to ruin the celebration, but we are in ⁢a big city,” Sanders remarked.\n\nUniversity Health spokeswoman Nancy Lewis reported that the⁤ hospital was treating eight gunshot victims, two ⁢of whom were in critical condition. The hospital was‍ also treating four individuals for injuries sustained in the ensuing chaos.\n\nLisa Augustine, a spokesperson for Children’s Mercy Kansas City, ⁤stated that the hospital was treating 12 patients from the rally, including 11 children, some of whom ⁤had suffered gunshot wounds.\n\nSt. Luke’s Hospital of Kansas City received ⁢one gunshot patient in critical condition and three walk-in patients with non-life-threatening injuries,‍ according to spokesperson Laurel Gifford.​ “When ⁢you have this many casualties, it’s going to get spread out among a lot of hospitals so that you don’t overwhelm any single ER,” she explained.\n\nChiefs trainer Rick Burkholder ‌was with coach Andy Reid and other team members at the time of the shooting. The team was on buses and returning ⁢to Arrowhead Stadium. “Praying ⁢for Kansas City,” tweeted Chiefs quarterback and Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes, along⁤ with three prayer hand emojis.\n\nMissouri’s Republican Gov. Mike Parson and first lady Teresa ⁤Parson were at the parade during the gunfire but were unharmed. ⁤”Thanks to the professionalism of our​ security officers and first ​responders, Teresa and I and our staff are safe and ⁤secure,” Parson ​stated.\n\nA White House spokesperson confirmed that President Joe Biden has been briefed on the shooting⁣ in⁣ Kansas City and will continue to receive updates. Federal law enforcement is on the scene supporting local law enforcement, and White House officials have ⁣been in touch with state and local leaders.\n\nFollowing the shooting, areas that had been bustling with crowds were left deserted, with police and firefighters standing behind an area cordoned off with yellow‌ tape.\n\nDespite the tragedy, the city and the team each contributed around $1 ​million‍ for‍ the event, commemorating Travis Kelce, Mahomes, and the Chiefs’ historic achievement of being the first team since Tom Brady and the New England‌ Patriots two decades ago to defend their title.\n\nAfter ‍decades without a championship, the city is gaining experience with victory parades. Five seasons ago, the Chiefs defeated the 49ers for the team’s first​ Super Bowl championship in 50 years. That followed the⁤ Kansas City Royals winning the World⁣ Series in 2015, the city’s first baseball ‌championship in 30 years. That year,⁤ fans ⁢abandoned⁣ their⁣ cars on the side of the highway so they could walk to⁤ the celebration.\n\nThen, last year, the Chiefs defeated⁣ the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35 and⁤ prophetically vowed they would be back for more.",

        "content": "SALEM, Ore. — A case of bubonic plague has⁢ been reported⁢ in central Oregon this week, with ‌the infected individual believed to ​have contracted the disease from their ill pet cat.\n\nPublic health officials have promptly provided medication to the ‌infected‌ individual and their close contacts. The community is not​ considered to be⁣ at risk. Despite ‍receiving treatment, the ⁢cat did not‌ survive.\n\nWhile not common, the plague is not entirely rare in ⁢the‌ western United States, with a few cases reported⁢ annually. This disease is distinct from Alaskapox, a rare ⁣disease that recently claimed‍ a life in Alaska.\n\nUnderstanding the Bubonic⁤ Plague\n\nThe⁣ plague is an infectious disease that can affect mammals. It is caused by the⁤ bacterium​ Yersinia ‍pestis, which is typically carried by‍ rodents and⁢ fleas. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease ‌Control‍ and Prevention, sunlight and drying can kill ​the‍ plague⁢ bacteria on surfaces. Humans and pets suspected of having the plague are usually treated with⁢ antibiotics, and occasionally with other medical interventions.\n\nThe symptoms of the plague can‍ vary.⁢ Bubonic plague, the type contracted by the Oregon resident, occurs when the ⁤plague bacteria infects the lymph nodes. This can result in fever, headache,‍ weakness, and painful,⁤ swollen lymph nodes. It is usually​ contracted through the bite of an infected​ flea, ‍as per the CDC.\n\nSepticemic plague occurs if‍ the⁤ bacteria enters the bloodstream. ⁢It can develop initially or after bubonic plague goes untreated. This form of ⁤the plague can cause fever, chills, weakness, ​abdominal pain, shock, and sometimes other symptoms like bleeding into the skin and blackened‌ fingers, toes, or the nose.⁢ The ⁢CDC states that this form can be contracted from⁣ flea bites or from handling an infected⁢ animal.\n\nPneumonic plague is the most severe form of the disease, occurring when the bacteria infects the lungs.⁣ This form of the plague can ‌cause rapidly developing pneumonia. It is the only form of the⁣ plague that ⁣can be spread from person to person through the inhalation of infectious droplets.\n\nAll forms of ⁣the plague can ‍be treated with common antibiotics. ⁢Early treatment significantly improves the chances of ⁤a full recovery, according to the CDC.\n\nAssessing the Risk of⁤ Infection\n\nIn the U.S., the CDC reports an average of seven human plague⁢ cases each year, with about 80% of ⁢these being the⁤ bubonic form of⁢ the disease. Most ⁤of these cases​ occur in the rural western⁣ and ⁢southwestern U.S.\n\nIn ‌2012, a welder in central Oregon contracted the disease after removing a rodent from his choking cat’s‌ mouth. He survived ‍but lost his fingertips and toes to the disease. A Colorado teen contracted a fatal case while⁤ hunting ​in 2015, and Colorado⁣ officials confirmed at least ⁣two cases last ⁢year — one of ‍them fatal.\n\nPeople⁣ can reduce the risk of plague by making their homes and ⁣outdoor living areas less attractive ⁤to rodents. This can be achieved ‍by‍ clearing brush and junk⁣ piles and keeping pet food inaccessible. Ground squirrels, chipmunks, and wood rats, along with other rodents, can carry the plague. Therefore, individuals‍ with bird and squirrel feeders should consider the risks if ⁢they live in areas with a plague outbreak.\n\nThe CDC recommends‌ using‍ repellent with DEET to ‌protect against rodent fleas when⁢ camping or working outdoors. Flea control ‌products‌ can ‌help ⁣prevent household pets‍ from becoming⁢ infected. If ⁢a pet falls ill, it should be‌ taken to⁤ a vet as soon as possible, as per ​the CDC’s ‌advice.\n\nThe Black Death in the 14th‌ century was perhaps the ‍most infamous plague epidemic, ‌killing up to half of the population as it spread through Europe, the Middle East, and northern ‌Africa. It began devastating ‍communities ‍in the Middle East‌ and Europe between 1347 and​ 1351, and significant outbreaks continued for roughly the ​next 400 years.\n\nWhile the⁢ plague remains a serious illness,⁢ antibiotics and supportive therapy are effective for even the most dangerous pneumonic form when patients are‌ treated in time, according ‍to ​the World Health Organization.",

This will be attempted in⁣ a special election scheduled for Tuesday⁢ in New York, which aims to fill ‌the void left ⁣by the removal of Republican George Santos from⁣ the ‍chamber.\n\nThe contenders for the seat, which represents a small section ⁤of New York City and some of its eastern suburbs,‍ are Mazi Melesa Pilip and Tom Suozzi. Pilip, an Ethiopian-born Republican county ⁣legislator ‍with a background​ in ​the Israeli military, is up against Suozzi, a seasoned Democrat who has previously served as a congressman, county executive, and mayor.\n\nThe Republicans currently hold a slim and ​somewhat chaotic 219-212 majority in the House, a situation that ‌has proven challenging to manage.‌ This‌ was⁣ evident last‍ week​ when ⁣the chamber failed to pass a measure to impeach President Joe Biden’s top border official, Alejandro Mayorkas, falling short ‍by a single vote. The House‌ is set to vote on this​ measure⁢ again, hoping that the​ return of Steve Scalise, the No. 2 Republican, from cancer treatment will tip⁤ the scales in their favor.\n\nSantos⁤ was ousted from the House following a‌ historic vote after serving for nearly 11 months. His colleagues voted him out ⁣due ‍to criminal corruption charges ‍and allegations of misusing⁣ campaign funds.\n\nEarly voting for this race ​kicked off on Feb. 3. Despite the district’s support for Biden in the 2020 election, Republicans in the New ⁤York ⁤area are known for their strong‍ turnout operation and have previously won several congressional seats ​in ‌the region.\n\nHowever, a major ⁤winter storm forecasted ⁣for the region⁣ could potentially impact voter turnout on Tuesday.\n\nImmigration ‍has⁤ emerged as a key issue in this election, mirroring the national sentiment ahead of ⁢the ‍anticipated rematch between Biden and former ‌President Donald Trump ‍in November.\n\nPilip ‍has consistently criticized ‍Suozzi and‍ the Democratic Party for ​their handling ​of ‍the southern border with Mexico. She has received endorsement‌ from a labor union⁣ representing Border Patrol officers.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Pilip stated, “I kept migrants‍ from being sent to Nassau and will secure⁢ the border when I get to ⁢Congress,” referring to Nassau ‌County.\n\nOn ‍the other hand, Suozzi ​has dismissed Pilip’s attacks as misleading and criticized ⁢her for lacking specific plans to address border security.⁢ He has highlighted his own bipartisan immigration compromise ​and condemned Republicans for rejecting a ⁣bipartisan border security deal negotiated in the Senate, which fell apart after Trump urged Republicans to reject ⁣it.\n\nDuring the election’s only debate, Suozzi said, “Ms. Pilip‍ points out there’s ‍a ⁢problem,​ there’s a problem, there’s a ‌problem.⁤ She has no solutions.”\n\nNeither of the candidates’ campaigns responded to requests for comment.\n\nLawrence Levy, ⁢the executive dean⁤ at Hofstra University’s ​National Center for Suburban Studies, ​believes that the special election could significantly influence both parties’ strategies in ⁣the suburbs in the‌ run-up to the November elections.\n\n“This race could be a⁣ bellwether for swing suburban districts around the⁣ country that are going to decide who controls the gavels of Congress,”⁣ he said.",

        "content": "In a recent development, a‌ federal judge​ in Columbus, Ohio, has halted the enforcement of a new law that mandates social media giants like Meta Platform’s Instagram and ByteDance’s TikTok to secure⁢ parental approval before permitting children ⁤under 16 to ⁣use their services.\n\nChief U.S. District‍ Judge Algenon Marbley, based in Columbia, sided with NetChoice, a tech industry trade association, asserting ​that the law infringes on the ‌free speech rights of minors as protected by‍ the First ​Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThis ruling is the latest in a series of court decisions that have⁤ obstructed state laws aimed at safeguarding‍ young internet users. These decisions come at a time when federal and⁢ state legislators⁢ are exploring ways ​to ⁣mitigate the ‍potential harm social⁢ media can inflict on the mental well-being of children.\n\nDave Yost, Ohio’s Republican attorney general, had defended the state’s Social Media Parental Notification Act, passed in July, as a legitimate effort‍ to shield minors from mental health ‍risks and sexual‍ predators.\n\nHowever, Judge Marbley concurred‌ with NetChoice, whose‌ membership includes TikTok, Elon Musk’s⁤ X, Alphabet’s YouTube, and Meta’s Facebook and Instagram.‌ He​ stated that the law was “not narrowly tailored‌ to those ends.”\n\nHe further commented, “Barring minors under ⁣16 from accessing all content on websites that the act aims to regulate, without explicit parental consent, is an excessively broad approach to mitigating the harm social media can cause to children.”\n\nThe ruling on Monday has indefinitely suspended Ohio’s law while the lawsuit⁤ proceeds.

        "content": "RAFAH, Gaza ⁢Strip — Early Monday morning, Rafah, a ⁤city located on the southernmost tip​ of the Gaza⁣ Strip, ‍was subjected to a series of Israeli strikes. This city has ⁤become a‌ refuge for approximately 1.4 million Palestinians who​ have⁣ fled from⁢ the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas ​that ⁢has been raging​ for four months.\n\nIsrael has been hinting that⁤ its ​ground offensive⁤ in⁢ Gaza may soon shift its focus to Rafah, a densely populated city situated on the Egyptian border. On Sunday, the White House announced that President Joe Biden had ‌cautioned ​Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against launching a‍ military ‌operation ⁢against Hamas in Rafah without a solid and feasible⁤ plan to safeguard ‍civilians.\n\nThe strikes targeted the vicinity of Kuwait Hospital early Monday morning,‌ according to an Associated Press journalist stationed in Rafah. Some of the‍ injured from the strikes were transported‍ to the ‌hospital for treatment.\n\nThe Israeli ‍military confirmed that it had targeted “terror ⁢sites in the Shaboura area” — a ⁢district in Rafah. The military statement did not provide further details about the targets or the potential damage or casualties, only stating that the‌ series‌ of strikes had concluded.\n\nPalestinian ⁤health officials have yet‌ to provide any information ‍regarding‍ casualties.\n\nBiden’s comments represent his strongest stance⁢ yet on the potential operation. Last week, Biden criticized Israel’s military response in⁣ Gaza as ⁣”excessive,” and called for “immediate⁤ and specific” measures⁢ to bolster ‌humanitarian ⁢aid. According to Israel’s‌ Channel 13 ⁢television, the conversation between Biden and Netanyahu lasted for 45 minutes.\n\nA senior U.S. administration official revealed ⁢that much of the call was spent discussing the potential ⁤for a cease-fire agreement. After weeks of diplomatic efforts, a “framework” is now “largely” in place for⁣ a deal that ‍could‍ result in the release of remaining​ hostages held by Hamas in exchange⁤ for a cessation of ‍hostilities.\n\nThe official, ‍who‌ requested anonymity to discuss the‍ negotiations, admitted that “gaps remain,” but declined to provide further details. The official also noted that recent military ‍pressure on Hamas in ‌the southern city of Khan Younis has brought ⁤the group closer to accepting a deal.\n\nNetanyahu’s office did not comment on the ​call. Earlier, Hamas’ ​Al-Aqsa television station quoted ‌an unnamed Hamas official who warned that any invasion of Rafah would “derail” the talks mediated by the ‌United States, ​Egypt,‌ and Qatar.\n\nBiden and⁢ Netanyahu’s conversation occurred after two Egyptian officials ‍and ‍a Western diplomat revealed that Egypt had ⁤threatened to suspend⁤ its peace treaty with Israel​ if troops were deployed in Rafah. Egypt is concerned that‌ fighting​ could force Palestinians into⁢ the Sinai ⁢Peninsula and necessitate the closure of Gaza’s primary aid supply ⁤route.\n\nThe threat to suspend the Camp David Accords, a key pillar of regional stability for nearly ⁣half a century, came after​ Netanyahu stated that deploying troops into Rafah was necessary to​ win the four-month ⁣war against Hamas. He claimed ⁤that Hamas has four‌ battalions stationed there.\n\nMore than half of Gaza’s population‌ of 2.3 million have sought refuge in Rafah to‌ escape fighting in other ​areas. They are crammed into tent camps and shelters run ⁣by the U.N. Egypt is worried ​about a potential mass influx ‍of Palestinian refugees who may never be allowed to return.\n\nNetanyahu​ told “Fox News Sunday”‌ that there’s⁣ “ample space north of Rafah for them to relocate to” after Israel’s offensive elsewhere in ⁢Gaza. He added that Israel would guide ‍evacuees with “leaflets, mobile ⁣phones, and⁢ safe corridors among other things.”‍ However, the offensive has ⁤caused widespread⁣ destruction, leaving little capacity to accommodate people.\n\nThe standoff between Israel and ‍Egypt, ⁢two ​close U.S. allies, has emerged ‍as aid groups warn that an ⁤offensive in ⁢Rafah would exacerbate the already dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. Approximately​ 80% of residents have fled their homes, and the U.N. reports that a​ quarter⁢ of the population is at risk of starvation.\n\nA ground operation in Rafah could sever one of the only‍ routes for delivering food⁣ and medical supplies. Wael Abu⁣ Omar,​ a spokesman for the Palestinian‍ Crossings ‌Authority, reported that forty-four trucks of aid entered Gaza on Sunday. ⁢This is a significant decrease‌ from the approximately 500 trucks that‌ entered daily before the war.\n\nOfficials, who​ requested anonymity due to the sensitive⁣ nature of the negotiations, revealed that‌ Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and other countries have also warned of severe consequences if Israel invades Rafah.\n\n“An Israeli offensive on Rafah would ⁢result in an unimaginable humanitarian disaster and serious tensions with Egypt,” wrote European Union​ foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on X. Human Rights Watch stated that⁤ forced displacement constitutes a war crime.\n\nIsrael and Egypt have fought five wars before signing the Camp David Accords, brokered by ‍the U.S., in the late 1970s. The agreement includes provisions governing the deployment of forces on both sides of the heavily fortified border.\n\nEgyptian​ officials are concerned that if the border is breached, the military would be unable to prevent a flood of people fleeing into the Sinai Peninsula.\n\nThe United ⁣Nations reports that Rafah, which normally has a population of fewer than 300,000,⁣ is now ⁤hosting an ‌additional 1.4 million people and is “severely overcrowded.”\n\nInside Rafah, some displaced ⁣people ⁢are on the move again. Rafat and Fedaa Abu⁤ Haloub, who fled from Beit Lahia in the north earlier in the ‍war, loaded their belongings​ onto a truck. “We don’t know where we can safely take him,” Fedaa said of their baby. “Every month we have to move.”\n\nOm Mohammad Al-Ghemry, displaced from Nuseirat, expressed her‌ hope that Egypt would not allow Israel to‌ force Palestinians to flee into the Sinai “because we​ do not want ⁣to leave.”\n\nHeavy fighting continues in central ⁤Gaza and Khan Younis.\n\nOn Sunday, Gaza’s Health‌ Ministry‍ reported that the bodies⁤ of 112 people killed across the territory had been brought ⁢to hospitals in the past 24 hours. The death toll since the ​start of the war stands ⁤at 28,176. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and fighters but states that the majority of those killed were ​women and children.\n\nThe ​war ‍began ⁢with a Hamas attack into southern Israel on Oct. 7, during which Palestinian⁣ militants killed approximately ‍1,200 people and abducted around 250. Over 100 hostages ⁢were released during ⁣a cease-fire in November.\n\nHamas has stated that it will not release⁤ more hostages⁢ unless Israel ends its offensive and withdraws ⁤from Gaza. Netanyahu has rejected both demands.",

The aircraft‌ had⁤ been scheduled to fly back to Fort Lauderdale on Friday afternoon.\n\nHop-a-Jet announced ⁣on‌ Friday night ⁢that⁣ it had “received confirmed reports⁢ of an accident ⁤involving one of our leased aircraft near Naples” and would dispatch ⁤a team ​to the crash ‌site,‍ as reported ⁣by the Naples Daily News.\n\n“Our immediate concern is for the‍ well-being of our passengers, ‍crew members, and their families,” the statement⁤ read. It didn’t provide further ⁢details of the crash.\n\nA spokesperson for Ohio State University⁢ clarified that the aircraft ‌is not affiliated with the university, ​and they had no‍ additional information⁣ about it.\n\nFederal authorities have stated that⁢ a preliminary report about the⁢ cause of the crash ⁤can be expected in 30 days.",

        "content": "From the heart of FORT WORTH, Texas —⁤ Last year, Trenace Dorsey-Hollins’ daughter,⁣ who is⁤ just​ 5 years old, was frequently unwell. Adhering to the school’s ⁢guidelines, Dorsey-Hollins ⁢ensured her daughter stayed home whenever she had a cough, a sore throat, or any other illness, until she was ​fully‍ recovered.\n\nAs the school year was‌ drawing to a close,‍ the school authorities‌ in Fort Worth, Texas, summoned her to discuss the high number of absences her daughter⁤ had accumulated.\n\nDuring the ⁢height of the pandemic, ⁢schools ⁤were adamant that parents and⁤ children should stay​ home at the slightest sign of illness. However, even though the emergency situation has subsided, Dorsey-Hollins claims that no one has clarified whether these rules have been revised.\n\n“The situation ⁤is incredibly​ perplexing,” she expressed.\n\n“In the past, ⁢if the child didn’t have a fever over 100, then it was deemed acceptable to send them to school,” ⁣said the mother of a 5-‍ and 13-year-old. “But now⁤ it seems like ​if they have a cough or they’re sneezing, you ⁢might ⁢want to keep them home. So, which is ⁤the ‌correct approach?”\n\nThe inconsistency in guidance on when to keep⁣ children home has only exacerbated ‌the confusion, which many believe is contributing to the nationwide epidemic⁢ of chronic‌ school ⁢absences.⁣ Some advocates, school systems, and even the state of California ‍are now⁣ encouraging children to attend‌ school even if ⁢they have minor illnesses ​like a cold, lice, or pinkeye.\n\nHedy Chang, the executive director of Attendance Works, a national nonprofit aimed at improving school attendance, believes that families need to understand that they no longer need to keep their⁢ children home at the slightest sign of⁣ illness.​ The organization‍ has issued its own guidance, urging parents to send ‍their children to school if they are capable of participating in ⁤daily activities.\n\n‘Navigating the Challenge’\n\n“We now have to re-engage children‌ and families and ⁢alter their perception about this,” Chang⁣ stated.\n\nThe American Academy of ‍Pediatrics advises that​ children⁣ should stay home ⁣if they ‌have a fever, vomiting or ​diarrhea, or ⁤if ‌they “are not‍ well enough to participate​ in⁢ class.”\n\nStriking the right balance is a​ challenge, and it’s understandable⁣ that different places⁤ would have different approaches, said ⁤Claire McCarthy, a⁣ pediatrician at Boston Children’s‌ Hospital and professor at Harvard ​Medical School.\n\n“Each school or school district has a different tolerance for illness,” McCarthy noted.\n\nThis leaves many parents ‍feeling ‍bewildered.\n\n“It’s a struggle,” ⁣admitted Malika ‍Elwin, a mother ⁤of a second grader on New York’s Long Island.\n\nShe doesn’t want to risk exposing other children or overburden the teacher with her daughter’s runny nose, so⁢ she’s ⁣kept her daughter ‌home‍ longer even though she’s feeling better because she still has cold symptoms. “Then ⁣I regret that because she just runs around here all day perfectly fine,” she confessed.\n\nFor those‍ who test positive for⁤ COVID-19, the CDC still recommends staying home and isolating for​ at⁣ least five days. However,‍ guidance from states and individual‍ schools varies widely. In some school ⁣systems, ⁤guidance allows ​for ​students‍ who test positive​ to go to school as ‍long as they are asymptomatic.\n\n‘A Shift in Perspective’\n\nSome ​authorities have reassessed their tolerance for illness. During‌ the 2021-2022 ⁢school year, more than a quarter‍ of students missed ‌at least 10% of the school year, up from 15%⁣ before the‍ pandemic.\n\nMissing‍ that much⁤ school puts students at risk of not learning ‌to read or graduate. Absent‍ students also miss out on meals, social interaction with peers and caring adults, ‍physical ‍exercise,​ and ‍access to mental health counseling ⁢and⁢ health care.​ In other words, missing school has its own health effects.\n\nAnd when a class sees high levels of chronic absenteeism, ⁤it affects the students who are present because‍ a teacher has to spend time reorienting the students who have been away.\n\nNoha Aboelata, who leads the Roots ‍Community Health Center in Oakland, California, said that the shift in guidance could disproportionately impact low-income communities and people of color. People in these communities⁣ might be more⁤ likely to live in multigenerational homes, take crowded public transportation or have poor ventilation in their ⁣homes. When ​people are out and about while sick,⁤ vulnerable loved ones could be put at risk.\n\nShe had hoped that the lessons ‍learned during the pandemic about staying home when contagious and taking care of ‍oneself and one’s family when sick would persist beyond the public health emergency. Instead, she said, “it feels‌ like the pendulum is swinging fiercely back in‌ the other direction.”\n\nBut changing the culture‍ around school ‍absences⁢ goes beyond⁣ just issuing guidance.\n\nSome schools in ⁣San Diego ‌County ⁢seem unaware of California’s new guidance allowing kids to ‌attend school ‌while mildly sick, said Tracy‍ Schmidt, who oversees attendance for the county ⁢Office ⁣of Education.\n\nHowever, others have adopted it and have begun discussing symptoms with parents who call to report their children are⁤ sick,​ urging‍ them to bring them in and see how‍ it goes. It ‍gives her hope that as more schools and parents learn about this‍ guidance, students will miss less school.\n\n“The most important place for⁢ our kids to be is⁤ school,” she emphasized. “We need to abandon this mindset that we had ‌to adopt during the pandemic because we were ⁢in a public safety emergency.”\n\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

        "content": "From the heart of ⁤JASPER, Ala. — A colossal ​radio tower, once the lifeblood of a quaint Alabama town and its neighboring ⁢county, has been stolen, leaving the community voiceless, according to ⁢the radio station’s general manager.\n\nIn a shocking⁣ turn of events, an unidentified thief or group of thieves managed to dismantle and steal the towering 200-foot ​structure, ⁢effectively‍ silencing WJLX radio in Jasper, Alabama. The investigation is ongoing, with no arrests made as of yet.\n\n“Our station has always been known as ⁣the sound of Walker County, and with our station currently off-air, it feels as though⁣ our community has been robbed of its voice,” lamented WJLX General Manager Brett Elmore in a conversation with the Associated Press.​ “This is a painful blow, not⁣ just for us, ⁤but for our entire community.”\n\nThe theft was ⁤discovered on Feb. 2, when a maintenance crew arrived at the secluded, wooded ‍location ‌where the tower once proudly stood, only to find it missing. To add ​insult to injury, ‍every piece of broadcasting equipment stored in a nearby building had also vanished.\n\n“To invade my building, steal all my equipment, and the tower?” Elmore questioned. ⁣”Why‍ not leave the tower — it’s the most costly item⁢ to replace.”\n\nElmore theorizes that the tower’s guy-wire was severed first, causing the structure to collapse. He suspects it was then cut into manageable ⁤pieces and carted away. “With some basic tools from Home Depot, this could be dismantled‌ in no time,” he added.\n\nUnfortunately, the station had no insurance on the tower or the ​equipment. Elmore estimates that it will cost between $60,000 to $100,000 to rebuild. “We’re a​ small market, we simply don’t have that kind of money,” ⁢he admitted.\n\nDespite the setback, Elmore has received messages of support from across the country, and a GoFundMe page has been set up to raise donations. Initially hesitant to start ⁣the fundraiser, a friend convinced him to put his pride aside if ⁤people are willing to help. By early Friday afternoon, over $1,100 had been raised.\n\nThe AM station, ​a staple⁢ in the community since the mid-1950s, is more than just a job for Elmore. His quarter-century in the radio business continues the legacy his father started at ⁣the station.\n\n“This is more than just a job or a radio ⁤station,” he expressed. “This ‌is a part of my identity.”\n\nJasper police are currently investigating the incident, Elmore confirmed. A representative from the police department was not⁣ immediately ⁣available for comment on Friday.\n\nDespite the challenges, Elmore remains ⁣hopeful about getting back on the ‍air.\n\n“We’re going to make‌ it,” he affirmed. “I have to keep the faith that we’re going to make it.”",

        "content": "From the heart of MOSCOW — In a recent interview, ‍Russian President Vladimir Putin made ⁤it clear that while⁢ Russia is prepared to defend its interests “to‌ the⁢ end”, it has no intention of extending its conflict⁣ in Ukraine to other nations such as Poland‌ and Latvia.\n\nThis marked Putin’s first interaction ​with⁤ an American journalist since the onset of Russia’s invasion of​ Ukraine nearly two ‌years ago. During the interview, Putin expressed his belief that Western leaders have come ‌to ‌understand the futility of⁢ attempting to strategically defeat Russia, leaving them pondering their next move.\n\n“We are prepared for this dialogue,” Putin stated⁤ confidently.\n\nFurthermore, Putin expressed optimism about the possibility of reaching⁢ an agreement to⁢ release U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich from the Wall​ Street Journal, who has been held in Russia for almost a year ⁣on charges of espionage.\n\nThe‍ Russian President’s comments were part of a comprehensive interview that lasted over​ two hours with conservative talk-show ⁣host Tucker Carlson. ⁣The interview took place in ​Moscow on Tuesday and was broadcasted on tuckercarlson.com.\n\nWhen questioned about the possibility of deploying Russian troops⁣ to ​Poland, a NATO member, Putin responded:\n\n“Only in one case, if⁤ Poland attacks Russia. ​Why? Because we​ have no‍ interest in​ Poland, Latvia or anywhere else. Why would we do that? We simply don’t have any interest.”\n\nPutin, speaking in Russian⁣ with his⁣ comments translated into ⁢English, began with extensive remarks ⁣about Russia’s relations with⁣ Ukraine, Poland, and other countries.\n\nPutin spent a significant portion of the interview expressing‌ his frustration that Ukraine had been close ‌to agreeing‍ to a deal to end hostilities⁢ at talks in Istanbul​ in April 2022, but backed ⁢out once Russian troops ⁣withdrew from near Kyiv.\n\n“Well now let them think how to reverse the situation,” he said. “We’re not against it. It would ‌be funny⁢ if it were not so sad that. This endless ⁣mobilization in Ukraine, the hysteria, the domestic problems, sooner or later, it will ‍result in an agreement.”\n\nThe ‍Russian‌ leader⁤ also pointed out that​ the U.S. has its own pressing domestic issues to address. “Wouldn’t it be better to negotiate with Russia? Make an agreement. Already understanding the situation that is developing today, realizing that Russia​ will fight for its interests to⁢ the end,” Putin suggested.\n\nThis endless mobilization in‍ Ukraine, the hysteria, the domestic problems, sooner or later ⁢it will result in an agreement.\n\n–Russian President Vladimir Putin\n\nDespite Washington’s clear stance of not wanting to negotiate on Putin’s terms, it has provided Ukraine with more than $110 billion in aid ‍since Russia’s invasion in February 2022.\n\nPutin’s last​ formal interview with a U.S. media outlet was in ⁣October 2021, with CNBC’s Hadley Gamble.\n\nThe Carlson interview comes at a ⁣time when​ U.S. lawmakers are debating whether to provide more funding for Ukraine’s war effort. The interview was aired⁤ on‌ the same day ⁢Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy replaced the popular army chief with his ground forces commander.\n\nA procedural vote in the U.S. ⁤Senate has advanced a bill that⁣ includes $61 billion in ⁤new funds for Ukraine, but its future is ⁢uncertain in the⁢ Republican-dominated House of Representatives. Several members, ​particularly those closely allied⁢ with former president ⁣Donald⁣ Trump, have voted against Ukraine ⁣aid.\n\nProgress in journalist’s case\n\nPutin revealed that Russian and American special services are discussing ⁢the Gershkovich ‍case‍ and ⁢have made some progress.\n\nPutin hinted that in return, Moscow wants Germany to release Vadim Krasikov, who was convicted of the 2019 murder ⁣of a Chechen dissident in Berlin, although he did not mention Krasikov by name.\n\n“There have been many successful examples of these talks crowned with success,” Putin said. “Probably this is going to be crowned with⁢ success as well but we have to come ⁣to an‍ agreement.”\n\nRussia ​and the United States have agreed to high-profile prisoner swaps in ​the ⁣past — most recently in December 2022 when Moscow traded Brittney Griner, a U.S. basketball star convicted of a drugs offense in Russia — for Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout.\n\nThe Kremlin stated that Putin agreed to‌ the Carlson interview because the former Fox News host’s approach differed from ⁢the “one-sided”⁤ reporting of the⁤ Ukraine conflict by many Western news outlets.\n\nCarlson is known to have close connections to Trump, ⁤who is expected to be the Republican Party candidate in the upcoming U.S. presidential election in November.\n\nBoth ⁣Trump and Carlson have criticized the billions of dollars in aid sent to Kyiv so far, calling for de-escalation of the war in Ukraine. The ⁢Biden‌ administration, on the other hand, has strongly backed the Zelenskyy government.\n\nCarlson​ has also expressed his belief that much of the Western media coverage of ‍the war⁢ is biased in Kyiv’s favor.",

        "content": "SIERRA VISTA, Arizona —⁢ U.S. Representative John Curtis, hailing from Utah, a state far removed from the U.S.-Mexico border, recently sought to understand the impact⁣ of the border​ situation on his constituents. He posed ⁢this question to Art Del Cueto, a leader of the National Border Patrol ‍Council, during a field ⁤hearing ⁣in Sierra Vista, Arizona.\n\n“Can you shed light ‍on how this⁤ situation affects Utahns and ⁢the‍ extent of its impact?” Curtis⁤ inquired during the Thursday ⁤hearing.\n\nDel Cueto responded, “The drug cartels ‌aren’t confined to this area. They ⁢don’t just profit from sales on our southern border or in ⁤border states. Their revenue comes from sales across​ the entire ⁤country,” including Utah. Del ⁤Cueto, a ⁤key figure in ​the National Border Patrol Council, a labor organization representing border patrol‌ agents, testified at the‌ hearing.\n\nReflecting on his visit, Curtis​ later shared ​with KSL.com that the most significant revelation was the lack of U.S. government control over ⁣the southern border, which allows for ‍the ‍entry of fentanyl and other drugs. Curtis, along ⁢with other ​Republicans, holds the Biden administration responsible for this ‍situation.\n\n“I arrived today with a clear objective — to understand the control dynamics of the border. ‌What I ⁤discovered ‌is that the border is controlled — ‍not by the U.S. government,‍ but‌ by the (drug) cartels. They dictate who enters, when they enter, and where they enter the United ⁢States,” Curtis, who represents Utah’s 3rd District, stated.\n\nAs the issue of inadequate security ⁣and a ⁢surge​ in illegal entries ‍from‍ Mexico continues to heat up, and U.S. lawmakers grapple with solutions, Curtis made a trip‌ to the border for a firsthand experience. Accompanied by 12 other Republican U.S. House members, this marked ⁢his third visit to the ​border.\n\nAccording to Curtis, the influx of ​drugs across the border is perhaps the most significant challenge Utah faces ‍due to insufficient security. “We have witnessed this in Utah.⁤ The (Utah) Highway⁤ Patrol has some alarming statistics ‍about the increase in fentanyl and fentanyl-related deaths,” ‌he‍ noted.\n\nRecent statistics from⁤ the U.S. ‍Drug ⁣Enforcement Administration highlight the ​severity of the fentanyl ⁤issue. Last year, fentanyl seizures in Utah,‌ Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming totaled approximately 3.4 million pills, with 664,200 seized in Utah alone. This marks ⁣a significant increase from​ 1.9 million pills in 2022 across the four states and​ 565,200 ​in 2021. The majority of the‍ fentanyl originates from⁤ two Mexican drug groups, the Sinaloa and Jalisco ⁢cartels. The ⁢DEA report⁣ stated that fentanyl is now the ⁤leading cause of death⁤ for Americans aged 18-45.\n\n“These criminal cartels, these‍ organized transnational organizations, are tearing our country apart one pill at ⁣a⁢ time, one entry at ⁢a time,” Mark Dannels, the Cochise County, Arizona, ⁣sheriff and another witness​ at⁣ Thursday’s field⁤ hearing, stated.\n\nU.S. Representative Tom Tiffany, R-Wisconsin, who led ⁤the hearing,⁢ stated that fentanyl claims⁣ the lives of ‍70,000 people in the United States ⁢annually.\n\n“It’s not difficult to comprehend how ‍fentanyl is flooding our​ country when the border checkpoints ‍are unmanned because⁤ they’re occupied with⁣ other tasks,” he said. He accused the Biden administration of letting the situation spiral out of control.\n\nOn Wednesday, ‍the U.S. Senate rejected a Republican-proposed plan ‌to ‌strengthen border security. Curtis acknowledged​ that devising​ a plan to address the issue could be challenging, given the ⁤severity of⁢ the problem.\n\n“That’s a tough question,” he‍ said, contemplating the likelihood of a bill that could garner sufficient Democratic and​ Republican support to⁢ pass. “I’m an optimistic person. While the odds ‌may ‌be against us, it won’t deter me from trying.”\n\nCurtis believes that HR2, a ​border ⁣security measure ‌passed by the U.S. House last⁤ May, could serve as a starting point. The measure,‍ which is yet to be considered in the‍ U.S. Senate, proposes limits on asylum eligibility ‍and advocates for renewed efforts to⁢ construct ‌a wall along ​the U.S.-Mexico border. More broadly, Curtis advocates ​for a return to the “remain in Mexico” policy ​implemented⁣ under former President Donald Trump, which required asylum seekers to stay in Mexico while their ⁣requests were processed.\n\n“I suspect that many in the Senate,⁢ particularly Senate ⁤Republicans, would support HR2,” Curtis said. “It’s ⁣the only thing that’s passed one of⁢ the bodies,⁤ so it’s a great starting point.”\n\nLast Sunday, Governor Spencer Cox ‌visited the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas with 13 other Republican governors, expressing ⁣concern over the state of border security. U.S.​ Representatives Celeste Maloy and Burgess ⁣Owens, who represent Utah’s 2nd and 4th Congressional Districts, respectively, visited the border at Eagle‍ Pass, Texas, on January‌ 3.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — The⁣ ongoing debate about ⁣border security has​ been fueled ⁤by the ⁣latest data from U.S. Customs ⁢and Border ⁢Protection, which reveals a⁤ significant increase in apprehensions and other activities at the U.S.-Mexico⁤ border.\n\nRecent ​figures, released‍ at the end of January, show that U.S. border officials recorded 302,034 encounters along the Southwest border in December. This number, which includes undocumented immigrants apprehended, those deemed inadmissible, and those processed for expulsion, ‍is the highest monthly total since the current tracking system was introduced in March 2020. Back then, the total number ⁤of encounters was 34,460.\n\nThese figures, indicative ‌of​ the⁢ volume of immigrants attempting to cross illegally into the United States, have drawn intense scrutiny ⁤from lawmakers in Utah‍ and Washington, D.C., who are focused ​on strengthening border security.\n\nDespite efforts by U.S. Senate ​Republicans to introduce a bill to ⁢enhance border security,‌ it was defeated on ‍Wednesday with 50 ​votes against ‍and 49 in favor. ​In addition to this, U.S. ​Rep.

The lowest monthly figure since the implementation of the new‍ tracking system was in April 2020, with 17,106 ‍encounters.\n\nMoreover, the total encounters for October, November, and ⁢December last year amounted ⁢to​ 785,422, surpassing the 719,017 encounters for the same three-month period in 2022; 518,935 in 2021; and 218,036 in 2020.\n\nInterestingly, the most recent data shows a rise in encounters involving individuals from countries outside of ‍Mexico and Central America, which are traditionally‌ the main⁤ sources of undocumented immigrants to the United ​States.\n\nIn December, Mexicans accounted for the highest number of encounters from a single country, with 69,042.

However, ‍encounters ⁤involving‌ individuals ⁣from other countries totaled 170,283, representing 56.4% of all encounters for the month​ and exceeding⁣ the combined total ⁢from Mexico and the three Central American countries.\n\nBy contrast, in December 2020, Mexicans accounted for 39,370 of the 73,994 encounters that month,‍ followed by Guatemalans with 12,454; Hondurans ​with 10,358; and Salvadorans with 3,921.

        "content": "WASHINGTON —⁤ Sen. Bernie Sanders is once⁣ again challenging⁤ the pharmaceutical​ industry, ⁣releasing ⁣a report⁤ on Tuesday that underscores the exorbitant cost of three top-selling drugs in the U.S. compared to other countries.\n\nThe price disparities are indeed eye-opening. For ⁣instance,⁤ the ​annual ⁤list price of‌ Eliquis, a stroke-preventing blood thinner from Bristol Myers⁣ Squibb,‍ is ⁣a ​staggering $7,100 in the U.S. However, in Japan, it’s only $940; in ⁤Canada, it’s $900;‍ and in ⁣France, it’s a mere $650.\n\nSimilarly, Johnson ‍& Johnson’s arthritis ‍medication, ​Stelara, has an annual list⁢ price of $79,000 in the U.S. In​ contrast, it’s priced at​ $30,000 in Germany, $20,000 in Canada,‍ and ⁣$12,000 in France.\n\nMoreover, the annual list price of Merck’s cancer ​treatment, Keytruda,⁤ is ​$191,000 in the U.S., ⁣while in the UK, it’s $115,000; in ⁢Canada, it’s $112,000; and in Japan, it’s just ⁢$44,000.\n\nSen. Sanders, an independent from Vermont, released the report ⁤in anticipation of a hearing on⁣ Thursday with⁤ the CEOs of the three pharmaceutical companies before ​the Senate Committee on ⁤Health, Education, Labor and⁤ Pensions,⁤ which he chairs. The ⁤hearing has already sparked controversy,⁤ with Sanders⁣ threatening ​to issue the committee’s first subpoenas in over four decades to force the heads of‍ Johnson & Johnson and Merck to ‍testify. They eventually agreed to appear voluntarily late last month.\n\nMedicare Begins Drug Price Negotiations\n\nMedications are typically far ⁢less expensive in other ⁢countries, largely because their governments often regulate the cost. However, this price gap could start to narrow‍ for certain drugs in ‍the near future.\n\nMedicare‌ has initiated its first-ever negotiations with pharmaceutical companies over the cost of 10 high-priced drugs, including‌ Eliquis ⁤and ⁢Stelara. While the⁢ prices​ charged⁣ in other​ countries are not‍ considered in the negotiation process, the Biden administration,⁣ Sanders, ⁣and others have consistently highlighted this price ​differential as a significant ⁣issue⁣ with the ⁣U.S. drug pricing system.\n\nDuring his tenure, former President Donald Trump proposed a measure that would have made Medicare pay the same price for certain costly prescription drugs⁣ as‍ other⁣ developed nations, a concept known as a ⁣”most-favored-nation price.” This would have enabled the U.S. to benefit from discounts negotiated by other ‌countries.\n\nAlthough the price patients pay for drugs usually depends‍ on their insurance coverage, list prices do⁣ influence both their premiums‍ and out-of-pocket expenses. Those who have not ⁤yet ⁣met ‍their deductible and the​ uninsured may have to pay⁤ the full list price.\n\nMassive Profits\n\nSanders’ report also highlighted the billions of dollars in profits these three companies ‍earn and the tens of millions their CEOs receive ⁤in compensation. The drugmakers have made more ‍money ‍from their sales of these three⁤ drugs ⁤in the US than in the rest of the world combined.\n\nThe report also pointed out⁢ that Johnson & Johnson and Bristol Myers Squibb spent $17.8 billion and⁢ $12.7 billion respectively on stock ‌buybacks, dividends,⁣ and executive compensation, compared to $14.6 billion and $9.5‍ billion⁤ on ​research​ and development in 2022. However, ​Merck‌ spent almost double on⁣ research and development than it did on dividends and‌ executive compensation.\n\nPharmaceutical ⁣companies have contended that Medicare’s price ⁣negotiations could stifle their research and development,⁤ potentially‌ leading to fewer new medications entering the market.",

        "content": "From the heart of DENVER — A group⁣ of young Black girls found ⁤themselves lying face‌ down on a parking lot, their cries of “no” and “mommy” echoing in the⁤ air. A police officer, who had previously pointed her gun at them, was‍ now handcuffing‌ two⁢ of them. The youngest among them, wearing a pink tiara, clung ​to her teenage cousin’s hand in⁤ fear.\n\nBrittney Gilliam, the mother of six-year-old ‌Lovely, watched helplessly as​ she was⁤ handcuffed and escorted ⁤to a patrol car. The police ​had mistakenly identified her car as stolen,​ leading to this unfortunate incident.\n\nFast forward three years,⁣ Gilliam has accepted a $1.9⁣ million settlement from the city officials of ‍Aurora, a suburb in Denver. This settlement was in response to a lawsuit that accused the police ‍officers of ⁤”profound and systematic” racism. The family’s lawyer, David Lane, made this announcement‍ on Monday.\n\nLane stated that the settlement spared the girls the distress of reliving the traumatic incident during a ‌trial. The settlement amount will be equally divided among the group, with the girls’ shares being invested in annuities. This will‍ allow‌ the money to grow by the ⁤time they turn 18 and can access‌ it.\n\n“All‌ parties are very ‌satisfied with this settlement,” Lane commented.\n\nHowever, a spokesperson ‍for the city of Aurora did ‍not immediately comment on the settlement.\n\nThe incident, which ​occurred on a summer day in 2020, was supposed to be a fun girls’ day out. Instead, it turned into⁣ a traumatic experience for Gilliam, her daughter, her sister, and two nieces.\n\nProsecutors found no evidence of the officers committing any crimes, as they ⁣were following ⁣their training for conducting a high-risk stop of a suspected stolen vehicle. However, they acknowledged that the incident was “unacceptable and preventable” and urged the ⁢police to⁢ review ‍their policies to prevent⁤ such incidents in the future.\n\nDarian Dasko, one of the officers‌ involved in the incident, ​was suspended for 160 hours. He and the other officer, Madisen Moen, continue to work for ​the department.\n\nThe video footage ⁤of​ the young girls lying face‌ down and being handcuffed sparked ⁤outrage, especially in the wake of protests ⁤over racial injustice triggered by the killing of ⁢George Floyd.\n\nThis settlement is not the first ⁤time Aurora has​ had to pay for ⁣police misconduct. ‌In 2021, the city settled ⁤for $15 ‌million with the parents of‌ Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man who was killed in 2019 after being stopped, placed in a‌ neck hold, and injected with a sedative. One police officer was convicted in his death, ‌while two others were acquitted.⁣ Two paramedics‍ were also convicted.\n\n‘You have to use common sense’\n\nA state civil rights investigation,⁤ launched in response to the ⁣outrage⁢ over McClain’s death, found a ⁣deeply ingrained culture of racially biased policing in the department.\n\nLane expressed ⁣hope that the ⁣settlement ⁣would send a​ message to law enforcement agencies ⁤across the country about the need for discretion in their responses.\n\n“You can’t be robocop and be​ an effective cop. You have to use common sense,” he stated.\n\nThe day that turned into⁢ a nightmare for Gilliam’s girls​ had started with⁤ a trip to a nail ⁢salon. However, they found it ‌closed. As Gilliam ‌was searching for another salon on her phone, officers approached their car with guns drawn and ordered her and a passenger ⁣to roll down their windows and put their hands out.\n\nThe officers were ⁤unable to see who else was inside the car due to the tinted windows. ‍Eventually, everyone was ordered out​ and made to lie on the ground.\n\nGilliam protested, “You don’t have to do all that. You don’t have to do all that,” as captured by the body camera⁢ footage.\n\n“OK. OK, we’ll deal with that,” Dasko responded.\n\n“Don’t tell me it’s OK!” Gilliam retorted.\n\nAbout a dozen bystanders gathered to watch the incident, with some recording it on their phones.\n\n‘It’s for our safety’\n\nThe⁢ video footage showed the police appearing​ confused about how to handle the situation when ‌they realized​ children were inside the SUV. Moen, who had just graduated from the police academy two days prior, was unsure about what to do after⁢ the​ girls were made‍ to lie on the ‍ground. She asked other officers‌ who arrived later if‌ she should handcuff all of them. Another officer advised her to handcuff some of them.\n\nSoon after, another officer seen in the footage decided it was time​ to de-escalate the situation. He ​reassured one of the handcuffed girls, “You’re going ‌to be with ‌your momma. You’re going to be okay. All right? All right? We’ll get you out in a second, sweetheart. It’s for our safety.” The⁣ body⁤ camera footage then shows Gilliam being led to a patrol car, her hands cuffed ‍behind her back.\n\nThe police soon realized their mistake amidst the shouting and crying. While the department’s system had notified them​ that Gilliam’s⁢ Dodge with Colorado license plates was stolen, the actual stolen vehicle was a motorcycle with the same license plate​ number in Montana.\n\nOfficers kept⁤ their guns drawn for about three-and-a-half minutes, and they ⁣removed the girls’⁤ handcuffs after about eight-and-a-half minutes, once they realized the car wasn’t stolen, according to ​prosecutors.\n\nFor the first ⁢year after the incident, ⁤Gilliam was filled with rage, angry that she couldn’t ⁤do anything to help the girls.\n\n“Mentally, it destroyed me because I felt⁢ like not only‌ am ⁣I not safe, these kids aren’t safe,”⁢ she said in⁣ an interview before ⁢the settlement​ was announced, recalling how⁢ it felt to be held​ on the ground in handcuffs.\n\nHer daughter, who was ​previously a “joyous” child, began acting out and became withdrawn. Lovely wouldn’t ⁢talk about what had happened. ‍Gilliam eventually realized her daughter‍ was afraid of upsetting ‍her further.\n\nHowever, exactly a year later, almost to the minute, Gilliam gave birth to another ⁤daughter. She felt that God was trying to wake​ her up and that she needed to ‌let go ‍of her anger.\n\n“I felt like I wanted justice, ‍but at the same point, I couldn’t be angry,” she said.⁢ “All I wanted to do was heal.”",

        "image": "https://whnynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3361-responsive_story_lg-1068x600.jpg",
        "content": "From the heart​ of SALT LAKE CITY, a growing concern is emerging‌ about the dietary‍ habits of Americans. It appears that the average American is consuming more protein than necessary, while their fiber ⁢intake is falling ⁤short. This imbalance⁣ in diet could potentially lead⁣ to serious health‌ issues.\n\nAs⁣ reported by Vox, ⁢Americans seem ​to have developed an “unusual fixation ​with protein,”​ consuming⁤ double the recommended dietary allowance. Astonishingly, “60% of U.S. ​adults are striving to incorporate even more protein into their ⁤diets.” This protein obsession could potentially heighten the risk of diseases such as cancer ⁢and heart disease.\n\nGoodRX Health highlights the importance of ⁢protein in our diets, stating, “Protein deficiency can ​pose a serious health risk‍ and is a common cause of malnutrition in other parts of the world. ‌As a ⁤macronutrient, protein is essential in large quantities for proper growth, development, and overall health.”\n\nHowever, the article also ⁣warns about ‌the dangers ⁢of overconsumption. “An excess of​ protein in your diet can disrupt your macronutrient balance. Consuming high amounts of protein usually involves eating a lot of meat and dairy⁢ products, which are often high in⁤ saturated⁢ fat and low in fiber.”\n\nThe ⁢consequences of this can⁣ be​ an increase in bad cholesterol, leading to a higher risk of‍ heart disease and‌ cancer. On the flip side, “plant-based proteins (e.g., beans, grains, soy, nuts, and seeds) are lower in saturated fat, high in fiber, ⁤and rich in micronutrients like vitamin K⁣ and potassium (which Americans tend to lack),” according⁤ to the article.\n\nThe federal government’s Dietary Guidelines‌ for Americans, 2020-2025, suggest healthy protein foods ​include “lean meats, poultry ⁢and eggs; seafood,⁣ beans, peas, and lentils; and nuts, seeds, and soy products.”\n\nThe New York Times ​in 2016 explained, “People ⁤need sufficient protein in the diet because it‌ supplies indispensable amino acids that⁢ our bodies cannot synthesize on their own. These amino acids are the essential building blocks used to make and maintain muscle, bone, skin, and other tissues, as well as a variety of ⁣vital hormones and⁤ enzymes.”\n\nHowever,⁢ the Times article also points out that Americans are likely​ consuming too much protein. It’s relatively‌ easy to meet the​ recommended daily protein intake — 56 grams⁢ for⁤ men and 46 grams for‍ women — without resorting to​ protein⁢ drinks or powders, which many people⁤ do. The Times noted that a cup of chopped chicken ​has about 44 grams of protein, while a cup of tofu ​or a serving of Greek yogurt has 20 grams. Three ​eggs provide 18 grams.\n\nAdding a protein bar ​or shake ⁣to this ‍can easily lead to overconsumption unless you’re mindful of your intake.\n\nThe Dangers of Protein Overconsumption\n\nAbout a decade ago,‍ the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that men consume nearly twice the amount of protein they need, ‍averaging⁤ about 100 grams⁢ per ⁤day. The revised Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggested that⁢ men and teenage boys, in particular, should “reduce ⁢overall intake of protein foods” and⁢ eat more vegetables. While ⁢teenage​ girls and older adults may not get enough protein, most American adults are getting too much.\n\nThe Times‌ article raised concerns that protein-rich foods don’t preserve muscle mass ⁢over time and a high-protein diet ​can lead⁤ to ​kidney disease for some. Some studies ⁣have suggested that too much protein can increase the risk of ⁣heart disease, cancer, and other⁤ problems.\n\n“One study led by Valter Longo, the director of the⁣ Longevity Institute​ at the University of Southern California⁤ in Los Angeles, followed‍ a nationally representative⁤ sample of 6,381 adults. It found that ​those who ate ⁣a high-protein diet between the ages of ⁣50 and 65 were four times more likely to die of ​cancer than those who consumed less protein,” according to the Times.\n\nHowever, ‍others argue that there’s not enough⁤ evidence to​ support this claim.\n\nScientific American highlighted⁢ another issue with excessive protein consumption in 2022. It reported that “protein-packed diets add ⁣excess nitrogen to the environment through ‍urine, rivaling pollution from agricultural⁤ fertilizers.”\n\nEven if it’s not harmful to human health, the article stated, ⁢”This excess does pose a problem for the country’s⁢ waterways. The nation’s wastewater​ is laden ⁣with the leftovers from protein digestion: nitrogen compounds that can feed toxic‌ algal blooms and pollute the‌ air and drinking water. This source of nitrogen pollution even rivals that ‌from fertilizers washed off of ‍fields​ growing food crops, new research ⁢suggests.”\n\nThe Importance of Fiber\n\nEating Well emphasizes that‍ fiber, although not a popular food topic, is crucial to our‌ health. Fiber is found​ in fruits,⁤ vegetables, ⁤whole grains, beans, legumes, nuts, and seeds, in ⁤two forms — soluble and insoluble. Both are⁢ vital to our ⁢health.\n\nThe article stated ‍that those who consume a lot of fiber have a lower risk of heart disease, cancer, Type 2 diabetes, ⁣and obesity. However, only 5% of Americans meet the recommendations‌ for fiber intake.\n\nInadequate fiber intake can ⁤lead to chronic inflammation, which is‌ linked to the aforementioned health issues. It can weaken the ⁤immune system, make weight management more difficult, and lead to ⁢constipation​ or diarrhea, hemorrhoids, an increased risk of colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease,‌ and other ailments.\n\nOne way to balance both​ protein and fiber intake is to opt for plant-based​ proteins more often and reduce consumption of⁤ meat⁣ and dairy.\n\nHealth.com listed the following ⁣as symptoms ⁣of protein deficiency:\n\nSwelling;\nChanges to​ hair and skin, including ⁤hair loss and graying or dry, thin, or peeling skin;\nFrequent illness;\nMuscle loss and weakness;\nDecreased bone density;\nStunted growth;\nWeight loss or gain;\nAnemia;\nAnother Dietary Concern\n\nProtein and fiber aren’t the only dietary concerns‍ for Americans.\n\nHarvard researchers⁤ recently highlighted that Americans are also harming their health ⁢due to the consumption of ultra-processed foods. According to a recent post on Scienceblog.com, these foods make‍ up the “bulk of the American diet” — and largely explain the obesity epidemic in America, ⁣with more than⁢ 40% of ⁣the ⁣population being obese,‍ as per the Centers ​for​ Disease ⁢Control and Prevention.\n\nIn‍ the Harvard research, participants were randomly assigned to an ultra-processed or unprocessed diet for two weeks. Despite the two groups being matched for⁤ nutrients, the ultra-processed group consumed about 500 calories ⁣more per day than the other⁤ group, leading⁣ to weight and ‌body fat gain. Those who consumed minimally processed foods “spontaneously lost weight and lost​ body fat.”",

        "content": "From the heart of SALT LAKE CITY — The dream of⁣ retiring comfortably is ​becoming increasingly elusive⁤ for many Americans. The ⁣estimated‍ savings required for a comfortable retirement continues to climb each year,⁤ with the latest figure pegged⁤ at ‌a staggering $1.8 million, as per a survey conducted by Charles Schwab.\n\nAccording to the survey, “While the required amount hasn’t seen a drastic ​increase, only 37% of workers are confident that they’ll be able to meet this target,​ a decrease of 10% from last​ year when the ‌figure was‍ $1.7 million.”\n\nThe retirement system in the U.S. heavily relies on individual ​responsibility for retirement savings. The sufficiency of retirement income is largely dependent on personal savings⁤ habits, investment decisions, and the availability of retirement plans through⁢ employment.\n\nRecent data from the Economic ⁤Innovation Group revealed that in 2021, ⁤”A staggering 69 million —⁢ or 55.5% — of workers did⁤ not have any form of employer-provided ​retirement plan, a‍ group that is predominantly composed of low-income⁢ earners.”\n\nThe data also ‌highlighted​ the disparity ‌among‌ states in terms of access to employer-provided retirement plans.\n\nIdaho emerged as the top‌ state, with 47% of its low-income workforce having access⁣ to an employer-provided retirement plan. In contrast, Florida lagged behind with only 23% of its low-income workforce having access to ⁤such plans.\n\nIn Utah, 30% of low-income‌ workers had access to an employer-provided retirement plan, but only 16% participated, leaving 260,134 low-income workers ⁤without any access.\n\nSen.⁤ Thom Tillis, R-N.C., stated ⁢in a press release, “Approximately 40 million ⁤Americans do not have ‍access to an ‌employer-sponsored​ retirement plan,⁤ posing a‍ significant hurdle to​ achieving⁢ financial‍ security for their retirement.”\n\nSenators Tillis and John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., ​along with Reps, Lloyd Smucker, R-Pa., and ⁤Terri Sewell,⁤ D-Ala., reintroduced⁤ the Retirement Savings​ for ‌Americans Act to Congress last ​year after its ⁤initial introduction to the Senate in 2022.\n\nUnderstanding the RSAA\n\nThe‍ Retirement Savings for Americans Act is a bipartisan bill aimed⁢ at enhancing⁢ retirement security and financial well-being ⁤for low- and middle-income American workers.\n\nThe act includes ⁣several key‍ provisions:\n\nEligibility and auto enrollment: ⁣The act targets full- and part-time⁤ workers who do not ⁢have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. These⁤ workers would be ⁣eligible for an account and automatically ⁢enrolled, with contributions‌ set at 3% of their income. They have the option to adjust this contribution rate or opt out entirely. Independent workers,‌ such as gig workers, are also included in this eligibility.\nFederal contribution: To support low- ⁢and moderate-income workers, the act proposes ⁣a ⁣1% automatic contribution ⁤and up‌ to a 4% matching contribution via ⁢a refundable federal tax ⁢credit. ‌This benefit starts to decrease at median income levels.\nPortability: One ⁢of the key benefits⁢ of the program is the portability‍ of the accounts. They remain with ​the workers throughout their careers, allowing them to stop and start contributions as needed.\nPrivate assets: The accounts are the property of the worker, and the assets​ can be passed down to future generations, aiding in wealth and financial security⁣ building.\nInvestment options: The ⁣act provides a range of investment options similar to those ​in the current Thrift ⁤Savings Plan. These include low-fee‍ investment choices like lifecycle funds, which are aligned with the worker’s estimated retirement‍ date, and index funds composed of stocks ‍and‌ bonds.\n\n“Americans who work hard their entire lives ‌deserve‌ to retire with dignity,” Hickenlooper said, as quoted by 401K Specialist. “This bill helps low-income ⁢workers enjoy a secure retirement and fulfill their American dream.”\n\nRSAA ‍Gains Widespread Support\n\nThe act ⁢has received endorsements from various ‍sectors‌ and organizations, reflecting a bipartisan interest in improving the⁤ U.S. retirement savings⁣ system.\n\nIn October, ⁢Charles Schwab, ⁣the American multinational financial services company, expressed its strong support for the act.\n\n“Creating‍ this⁢ kind of program meets an‍ obligation we all share to help every working American build financial security and ​well-being in retirement. I also know it will offset future support ‌we surely would have to ⁢provide if we don’t help more people begin to build that⁢ security today,” founder ‌and co-chairman Charles⁣ Schwab said ⁢in his support letter.\n\n“And in ⁤true American spirit, ⁤it⁢ isn’t a giveaway, ‌but an⁤ incentive for working ‍individuals‍ to begin helping themselves and their families,” he added.\n\nThe American Association of Retired Persons, a prominent nonprofit and nonpartisan organization, is the latest to fully endorse⁢ the Retirement Savings for ‍Americans Act.\n\n“Nearly ‌1 out ⁢of​ 4 ⁢Americans ⁣has no retirement savings, and more than half of all Americans report they are concerned they will not‌ achieve financial security in retirement. We​ know that Americans are much more likely⁤ to save when ⁣they have access to retirement savings options at work. Today, nearly half of all private-sector employees do⁢ not have access to⁤ an​ employer-sponsored ‍retirement⁤ savings program,” Bill Sweeney, senior vice president ​of government affairs⁤ at AARP, said in ‍the RSAA endorsement letter.",

        "content": "From the heart of COLUMBIA, S.C., we bring⁢ you the news that President Joe Biden has once again demonstrated his ⁢political prowess by securing a resounding victory in South ​Carolina’s Democratic primary for the 2024 elections. This ⁣triumph echoes his ‌success in the same state four years ago, which‍ served as a springboard‍ for his journey⁣ to the Oval ⁢Office.\n\nOn this victorious ​Saturday, ‌Biden ‌outshone other Democratic contenders on the South Carolina ballot, including ⁢Minnesota’s⁣ Representative Dean Phillips⁣ and renowned author Marianne Williamson.\n\nThe⁣ president’s campaign team had put in a significant amount of effort to boost voter turnout‌ for Biden. Their ‌strategy was to ⁤test ⁣the waters for mobilizing Black voters, a crucial demographic⁤ in South Carolina’s‌ Democratic ‍vote and⁢ a cornerstone of Biden’s‌ blueprint for​ victory in the upcoming November elections.\n\nThe choice of South Carolina as the kickoff for the party’s 2024 primary calendar was a strategic one, endorsed by Biden and​ other party leaders. They ​highlighted ​the state’s racially diverse population, a stark contrast to the predominantly white demographics ⁤of traditional early-voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nDespite the Democratic National Committee’s stance, New Hampshire went ahead ‍with a leadoff⁢ primary last ⁤month. However, ⁢without the backing​ of the president or the national ‍party, and with no official delegates at ⁢stake, the contest​ was nonbinding. Nevertheless,‌ Biden emerged victorious in New ⁣Hampshire, ⁤thanks to a successful write-in campaign by his supporters.\n\nSouth​ Carolina,​ a state where Biden has nurtured deep relationships with supporters and donors over the years, played a crucial role in his 2020 campaign. A significant victory ⁢here breathed ⁤new⁤ life into his campaign in other early-voting ⁣states,⁢ catapulting him towards‍ the nomination.\n\nRep. Jim ⁢Clyburn has been instrumental in Biden’s⁤ South ‌Carolina campaign. Clyburn’s endorsement in 2020 served as a beacon for the state’s Black voters, signaling that Biden was the candidate ⁤who would champion ‍their interests.\n\nBoth Biden‌ and Vice⁣ President Kamala Harris, the first Black woman and Asian American to serve in this role, have consistently expressed their gratitude to the state’s Democrats for their unwavering support. At ‍a‌ state party fundraiser a week⁤ ago, Biden acknowledged the role of the state’s Democrats in his presidency, stating, “you’re​ the reason I am president.” He also rallied the party faithful, declaring that they were “the reason Donald Trump​ is a loser. ⁣And ⁤you’re the ⁣reason we’re going to win ⁣and beat him again,” thereby⁣ setting the stage for a likely general election face-off‍ with the GOP’s current front-runner.\n\nThe Biden reelection campaign has used ‍the state’s primary to fine-tune strategies and messages that resonate with Black voters and motivate‌ them⁢ to vote in​ the November general election. Despite⁣ South‍ Carolina’s strong Republican leanings,‍ its diverse primary voters reflect the Democratic coalition that Biden needs to secure ‌for another term​ in‍ office.\n\nWith South Carolina’s primary concluded, the Democratic nominating calendar now moves to Nevada, which holds its primary on ‍Tuesday, followed by Michigan on Feb. 27.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON ⁣— In a second wave of attacks aimed at crippling ‍Iran-backed ​groups, the United ⁤States and Britain targeted 36 Houthi locations in Yemen on Saturday.⁢ These groups have been persistently launching attacks on American and international interests following ⁢the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nThe most‌ recent offensive against⁤ the Houthis was ⁢carried out by warships and fighter jets. This follows an⁤ air assault in Iraq and Syria on Friday,​ which ⁣targeted other Iranian-backed militias and the Iranian Revolutionary ⁤Guard in response to a drone strike that resulted in‌ the death of three U.S. troops in Jordan the previous weekend.\n\nThe Houthi ⁤targets, spread across 13 different locations, were hit by U.S. F/A-18 fighter jets from ⁤the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier and by the USS Gravely and the USS Carney ‌Navy destroyers, which⁢ launched Tomahawk missiles from the Red Sea. This information was provided⁤ by U.S.​ officials⁣ to the Associated Press under the condition ‍of ​anonymity,⁤ as they were not ⁤authorized to publicly discuss the military operation.\n\nThe ⁣U.S. made it clear that its response to the soldiers’​ deaths at the⁤ Tower 22 base in Jordan last Sunday would not be ‍confined to a single night, ‌target, or ‍group. However, the‌ Houthis have been launching almost daily missile or drone attacks against commercial and military‌ ships in⁣ the⁢ Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, and ⁢they have shown no signs of reducing their campaign. The impact of the allied assaults on their activities remains uncertain.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin stated that the military action, supported by Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, the ⁣Netherlands, and New Zealand, “sends a clear message to the Houthis that they will continue to face further⁣ consequences if they do not cease their ⁢illegal ⁣attacks on international shipping and naval vessels.”\n\nHe further added, “We will not hesitate to defend⁢ lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world’s most critical waterways.”\n\nThe Defense Department revealed that the strikes targeted sites associated ⁤with the Houthis’ deeply buried weapons storage facilities, ​missile systems and launchers, ‍air defense systems, and radars.\n\nSaturday’s strikes marked the third time the U.S. ⁢and Britain had conducted a large‍ joint operation to strike‌ Houthi weapon launchers, radar sites, and drones. The strikes in Yemen are intended to emphasize the broader ​message to Iran that ⁤Washington holds Tehran accountable for arming, funding, and⁤ training the array of militias behind attacks across the Mideast against U.S. and⁤ international interests over the past‌ several months, ​including‍ in Iraq and Syria by the rebels in Yemen.\n\nVideo footage shared online by residents of Sanaa, Yemen’s capital, included the sound of explosions and at least one blast​ lighting up the night sky. The blasts were reported to ⁤have occurred around buildings associated ⁤with the Yemeni presidential compound. The Houthi-controlled state-run news agency, SABA, reported strikes in al-Bayda, Dhamar, Hajjah, Hodeida, Taiz, and Sanaa provinces.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. destroyer Laboon and F/A-18s from the Eisenhower shot down​ seven drones fired from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen into the⁣ Red Sea. The ⁣destroyer Carney shot down a drone fired in the Gulf of Aden, and U.S. forces took out four more ​drones that were prepared to ⁣launch.\n\nHours before the latest joint operation, the U.S. conducted another self-defense strike on a site in Yemen, destroying six anti-ship cruise⁤ missiles, as it has done repeatedly when ⁤it has ⁣detected a missile or drone ready‍ to launch.\n\nThe Houthi attacks have forced shipping companies to reroute their vessels ‍from⁤ the Red Sea, sending them around Africa through the Cape‌ of Good⁣ Hope ⁢— a much⁤ longer, costlier, and less efficient passage. The threats have also ‌led the U.S. and its allies to establish a joint mission⁢ where warships from⁢ participating ⁤nations provide a protective umbrella of air defense for ships as they travel⁣ the critical waterway that ‌runs from the Suez Canal down ⁢to the Bab el-Mandeb Strait.\n\nDuring normal operations, about 400 commercial vessels‍ transit the southern Red Sea at any given time.\n\nThe U.S. has attributed the Jordan attack to the Islamic Resistance ⁣in Iraq, a coalition ⁢of Iranian-backed militias.​ Iran has attempted to distance itself from the drone strike, claiming⁢ that the militias act independently of its direction.\n\nHussein al-Mosawi, spokesperson for Harakat al-Nujaba, one of the main Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, condemned the earlier U.S. strike in ⁣Iraq and warned Washington that “every action elicits a reaction.” However, in an AP interview in ‍Baghdad, he also struck a⁤ more conciliatory tone, stating, ​”We do not ⁤wish to escalate or widen regional tensions.”\n\nMosawi revealed that⁤ the ⁣targeted sites in Iraq were mainly‍ “devoid ​of fighters and military personnel at the time of the attack.”\n\nRami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported that 23 people, all rank-and-file fighters, were‌ killed. ⁢Iraqi government spokesperson Bassim al-Awadi stated that 16 people, including civilians, were killed and there was “significant damage” to homes and private properties.\n\nThe U.S. confirmed that it had informed ‍Iraq about the operation before it commenced.\n\nA U.S. official revealed ​that an initial battle ‌damage assessment showed the U.S.​ had struck ​each of its planned targets in addition‍ to a few ⁢”dynamic targets” that​ emerged as the mission unfolded, including a surface-to-air missile site‌ and drone ‍launch sites. The official, ⁢who‍ spoke on the condition of ⁢anonymity to provide details that were not ⁣yet⁤ public,⁣ did not have a casualty assessment.\n\nThe Iraqi government has been ⁣in a delicate position ‍since⁢ a group of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias calling itself Islamic Resistance⁢ in Iraq began launching attacks on U.S. bases ⁣in Iraq and Syria on Oct. 18. The group described the strikes as retaliation⁣ for Washington’s support‍ for Israel in ​the war in Gaza.\n\nBehind the scenes,​ Iraqi officials have attempted to rein ⁤in the ​militias, while also condemning U.S. retaliatory strikes as a violation of Iraqi sovereignty and calling for an exit of the⁣ 2,500 U.S. troops who are in the country as part‌ of ⁢an international coalition to fight IS. Last month, Iraqi and U.S. military officials launched formal talks to wind ⁣down the coalition’s presence, a process that will likely take years.",

        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — President Joe Biden on Sunday told Morehouse College graduates during his commencement speech that he heard their voices of protest over the Israel-Hamas war, and that scenes from the conflict in Gaza have been heartbreaking.\n\n“I support peaceful nonviolent protest,” he told students at the all-male, historically Black college, some who wore keffiyeh scarves around their shoulders on top of their black graduation robes. “Your voices should be heard, and I promise you I hear them.”\n\nThe president said there was a “humanitarian crisis in Gaza, that’s why I’ve called for an immediate cease-fire to stop the fighting” and bring home the hostages taken when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7. The comments, toward the end of his address that also reflected on American democracy and his role in safeguarding it, were the most direct recognition to U.S. students about the campus protests that have swept across the country.\n\n“It’s one of the hardest, most complicated problems in the world,” Biden told the graduates. “There’s nothing easy about it. I know it angers and frustrates many of you, including my family. But most of all I know it breaks your heart. It breaks mine as well.”\n\nPresident Biden travels to Atlanta this weekend to deliver a commencement address at Morehouse College. (CNN, KEYE, WSB, WJLA)\n\nThe speech — one planned later Sunday in Detroit — is part of a burst of outreach to Black constituents by the president, who has watched his support among these voters soften since their strong backing helped put him in the Oval Office in 2020.\n\nBiden spent much of his address focused on the problems at home. He condemned Donald Trump’s rhetoric on immigrants and noting that the class of 2024 started college in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and George Floyd’s murder. Biden said it was natural for them, and others, to wonder whether the democracy “you hear about actually works for you.”\n\n“If Black men are being killed in the street. What is democracy?” he asked. “The trail of broken promises that still leave Black communities behind. What is democracy? If you have to be 10 times better than anyone else to get a fair shot.”\n\nProtests over the war have roiled America’s campuses. Columbia University canceled its main commencement ceremony. At Morehouse, the announcement that Biden would be the commencement speaker drew some backlash among the faculty and those who oppose the president’s handling of the war. Some Morehouse alumni circulated an online letter condemning administrators for inviting Biden and they solicited signatures to pressure Morehouse President David Thomas to rescind it.\n\nThe letter claimed that Biden’s approach to Israel amounted to support of genocide in Gaza and was out of step with the pacifism expressed by Martin Luther King Jr., Morehouse’s most famous graduate.\n\nThe Hamas attack on southern Israel killed 1,200 people. Israel’s offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to health officials in the territory.\n\nBut in the end, there were no major disruptions at the event. At least seven graduates and a faculty member sat with their backs turned during Biden’s address, and another student draped himself in a Palestinian flag.\n\nOn the stage behind the president as he spoke, academics unfurled a Congolese flag. The African country has been mired in a civil war, and many racial justice advocates have called for greater attention to the conflict as well as American help in ending the violence.\n\nThe class valedictorian, DeAngelo Jeremiah Fletcher, said at the close of his speech that it was his duty to speak on the war in Gaza and that it was important to recognize that both Palestinians and Israelis have suffered.\n\n“From the comfort of our homes, we watch an unprecedented number of civilians mourn the loss of men, women and children, while calling for the release of all hostages he said. “It is my stance as a Morehouse man, nay as a human being, to call for an immediate and permanent cease-fire in the Gaza Strip.”\n\nBiden stook and shook his hand after Fletcher finished. The college also awarded Biden an honorary degree.\n\nAfter he accepted the honor, Biden joked: “I’m not going home,” as chants of “four more years” broke out in the audience before he left the stage. He was heading to Detroit to speak at an NAACP dinner.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, second from left, waits before speaking to graduating students at the Morehouse College commencement Sunday, May 19, 2024, in Atlanta.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nGeorgia and Michigan are among a handful of states that will help decide November’s expected rematch between Biden and Trump. Biden narrowly won Georgia and Michigan in 2020 and needs to repeat — with a boost from strong Black voter turnout in both cities.\n\nBiden spent the back end of the past week reaching out to Black constituents. He met with plaintiffs and relatives of those involved in Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision that outlawed racial segregation in public schools. He also met with members of the “Divine Nine” Black fraternities and sororities and spoke with members of the Little Rock Nine, who helped integrate a public school in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1957.\n\nIn Detroit, Biden planned to visit a Black-owned small business before giving the keynote address at the NAACP’s Freedom Fund dinner, which traditionally draws thousands of attendees. The speech gives Biden a chance to reach thousands of people in Wayne County, an area that has historically voted overwhelmingly Democratic but has shown signs of resistance to his reelection bid.\n\nWayne County also holds one of the largest Arab American populations in the nation, predominantly in the city of Dearborn. Leaders there were at the forefront of an “uncommitted” effort that received over 100,000 votes in the state’s Democratic primary and spread across the country.\n\nA protest rally and march against Biden’s visit were planned in Dearborn. Another protest rally was expected the dinner venue.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Joey Cappelletti in Lansing, Michigan and Colleen Long and Mark Sherman in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that the first name of Rev.

On May 8, several students from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) gathered at Morehouse, a nationally acclaimed HBCU, to protest his speech.\n\nThe protesters said they disagree with Biden’s support of Israel in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.\n\nSome Morehouse alumni circulated an online letter condemning school administrators for inviting Biden and soliciting signatures to pressure Morehouse President David Thomas to rescind it.\n\nThe letter claimed that Biden’s approach to Israel amounted to support of genocide in Gaza and was out of step with the pacifism expressed by Martin Luther King Jr., Morehouse’s most famous graduate.\n\nBefore the commencement, Thomas said that silent, non-disruptive protests would be tolerated, but repeated a pledge to halt the ceremony if disruptions mount.\n\nThe White House had hinted that Biden would reference the concerns of students and faculty at the male-only, historically Black college over his approach to the war. Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, “stay tuned,” when asked if the Democratic president would address the worries that sparked weeks of student protests on college campuses nationwide.\n\nNearly all the streets around the campus were shut down for the event. As the packed crowd gathered just before graduates began filing into the quad, Associate Provost Mel Foster warned: “Although we respect everyone’s right to free speech, Morehouse College has issued guidelines to ensure we are in line with the law.”\n\nSome members of the graduating class showed support for Palestinians in Gaza by tying keffiyeh scarves around their shoulders on top of their black graduation robes. One student draped himself in a Palestinian flag.\n\nThis weekend marks the president’s first visit back to the Peach State after a March campaign rally.\n\nBiden arrived at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport on Saturday.\n\nSeveral politicians, including Senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, Mayor Andre Dickens, Rep. Nikema Williams, Fulton County Commission Chairman Robb Pitts and more, greeted Biden on the tarmac Saturday before he left in a motorcade.\n\nHe later stopped at Mary Mac’s Tea Room, a Black-owned restaurant that opened nearly 80 years ago, to briefly address about 50 supporters. A 2024 Morehouse graduate introduced him.\n\nThe president joked about being surrounded by “Morehouse Men.”\n\nRELATED: President Biden arrives in Atlanta ahead of campaign event, Morehouse commencement speech\n\nThe president is set to depart from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport at 11:30 a.m. Sunday. He’s traveling to Detroit to address an NAACP dinner.\n\nAtlanta News First will stream the entire Morehouse College commencement, including President Biden’s remarks. Watch live at 9 a.m. by downloading the ANF+ app on Roku, AppleTV, FireTV or YouTube. Just search “Atlanta News First” anywhere you stream!\n\nLast month, Morehouse announced it had invited Biden to deliver the address, but almost immediately after the announcement, students, faculty and alumni began expressing concern over Biden’s visit to the campus.\n\nMorehouse faculty voted to give Biden an honorary degree before his commencement speech. Several people who met him on the tarmac, including Warnock, are Morehouse alumni.\n\nThe speech at Morehouse, and the separate one Biden is giving later Sunday in the Midwest, is part of a burst of outreach to Black constituents by the president, who has watched his support among these voters soften since their strong backing helped put him in the Oval Office in 2020.\n\nGeorgia and Michigan are among a handful of states that will help decide November’s expected rematch between Biden and Republican former President Donald Trump. Biden narrowly won Georgia and Michigan in 2020 and needs to repeat — with a boost from strong Black voter turnout in both cities.\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has been looking forward to the Morehouse speech, as he does all of his commencement addresses. He has been writing the remarks himself, along with senior advisers, she said.\n\n“When it comes to this difficult moment in time that we’re in as we speak about the protests, he understands that there’s a lot of pain,” Jean-Pierre said. “He understands that people have a lot of opinions and he respects that folks have a lot of opinions.”\n\nBiden and former President Donald Trump will also be in Atlanta on June 27, 2024, for a historic presidential debate hosted at CNN’s Atlanta’s studios.\n\nThe debate will air live on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Español, CNN Max and CNN.com, at 9 p.m.\n\nBoth Biden and Trump are the respective, presumptive Democratic and GOP nominees for president, setting the stage for a historic rematch of their 2020 campaigns. They have been polling well within the margins of error for every poll thus far in the election season, making Georgia a virtual toss-up.\n\nAtlanta News First and Atlanta News First+ provide you with the latest news, headlines and insights as Georgia continues its role at the forefront of the nation’s political scene.

        "content": "(AP) - Georgia Republicans on Saturday elected to the Republican National Committee a conservative activist who helped organize the Jan. 6, 2021, pro-Trump rally that led to a mob storming the U.S. Capitol.\n\nDelegates at the convention in Columbus rendered a split decision, choosing Amy Kremer for one of the two RNC seats, but retaining incumbent Committeeman Jason Thompson.\n\nKremer and other challengers argued that Thompson and Ginger Howard, the other incumbent, hadn’t done enough to support Donald Trump. They pointed out the continued desire of party activists for confrontation with internal and external enemies, even as many in leadership tried to preach unity and ease divisions that have left Republican Gov. Brian Kemp estranged from the party organization.\n\n“We need somebody willing to stand up and fight,” Kremer told delegates. “If you want the grassroots to have a voice, then you need to vote for change.”\n\nKremer, who got her political start in the Tea Party movement, wasn’t part of the mob that stormed the Capitol as Congress met to certify Democrat Joe Biden’s election win. But it was her group that secured the permit for the “Save America” rally where Trump told the crowd to \" fight like hell.” She spoke at the event and was among the most active fundraisers in the “Stop the Steal” movement advancing the lie that Biden’s victory was stolen.\n\nLeaders of the party had recommended against electing Kremer, noting among other issues that she and an affiliated group have unpaid Federal Election Commission fines.\n\nDelegates reelected Thompson despite attacks saying his wife and daughter worked for Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, the Republican chief election official who defended the 2020 election result in Georgia that saw Biden capture the state’s 16 electoral votes. Raffensperger was repeatedly likened to the devil during the weekend convention.\n\nThompson fell short of a majority in an initial three-candidate race but won in a runoff.\n\n“Together we will fight the forces that seek to destroy America,” Thompson told delegates. “Together we will win the state of Georgia for President Trump.”\n\nMost speakers called on Republicans to put their internal divisions behind them, including U.S. Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene, an unlikely messenger of GOP unity.\n\nGreene, who earned rebukes from other Republicans during her failed attempt to oust U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, told attendees at a party breakfast Saturday that “there’s nothing wrong with a little bit of arguing in the Republican Party” but those divisions should stop now.\n\n“If we’re too fractured, we can’t work together to hit that home run in November,” Greene said. “And that’s going to be a problem. If we’re too off in different directions, and not working together, we cannot hit that home run in November.”\n\nGreene, though, was speaking at a convention that was once again skipped by Gov. Brian Kemp, who created a rival fundraising and political operation after Trump attacked him for backing the 2020 election results. The fracture deepened when some party leaders supported former U.S. Sen. David Perdue’s unsuccessful, Trump-backed challenge to Kemp in 2022.\n\nThere were some signs of unity. Two Kemp allies, Insurance Commissioner John King and state Rep. Tim Fleming, Kemp’s 2018 campaign manager, both spoke to the convention. So did a larger number of state lawmakers than last year. Party Chairman Josh McKoon, a former state senator, said that was part of his attempt fuse the party back together.\n\n“That’s another thing we’ve been working on, is our relationship with elected officials and kind of bringing everybody back to the table,” McKoon said.\n\nRepublicans repeatedly said they believe inflation and immigration are the issues that will allow them to win over people who didn’t vote in 2020 or who voted for Biden. Georgia Labor Commissioner Bruce Thompson brandished his wallet during a Friday speech to tell delegates how to reach undecided voters.\n\n“Don’t pound them over abortion, don’t pound over things that maybe aren’t relevant,” Thompson said. “Pound them over what really matters, which is right here. This is relevant to every single American. It’s their pocketbook.”\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.",

        "content": "(AP) - Amy Kremer stood near the White House on Jan. 6, 2021, and told thousands of Donald Trump’s supporters that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent.\n\n“Hello, deplorables,” she said, embracing a label Hillary Clinton once lobbed against Trump’s followers.\n\nKremer, a conservative activist from suburban Atlanta, wasn’t part of the mob that hours later stormed the Capitol as Congress met to certify Democrat Joe Biden as Trump’s successor. But it was Kremer’s group that secured the permit for the “Save America” rally where Trump told the crowd to “fight like hell,” and she was among the most active fundraisers in the “Stop the Steal” movement advancing the lie that Biden’s victory was stolen.\n\nAs Trump seeks a return to the White House, Kremer is trying to win one of two Georgia seats on the Republican National Committee. The votes at a state party convention Saturday are expected to show how consumed by the 2020 election the GOP remains in Georgia and everywhere else.\n\nKremer argues the RNC hasn’t done enough to fight for Trump or protect others who fought for him, like the 16 Georgia Republicans who falsely claimed to be valid Trump electors in a state Joe Biden won.\n\n“It’s not enough to just espouse conservatism anymore,” Kremer told a party group on April 24. “We have to stand up and fight. And the RNC has not done it.”\n\nBut like many other state parties, Georgia’s GOP has splintered. Gov. Brian Kemp created a rival fundraising and political operation after Trump attacked him for backing the 2020 election results. The fracture deepened when some party leaders supported former U.S. Sen. David Perdue’s unsuccessful, Trump-backed challenge to Kemp in 2022. Neither Kemp nor his allies will attend the convention.\n\nSome Kemp supporters disdain the state party as irrelevant, saying Republican elected officials better reflect the views of all Georgia Republicans. But the party remains a training ground for future candidates, Kemp will only be governor until January 2027 and Georgia’s majority-Republican legislature continues to translate activist demands into law.\n\n“You can’t dismiss it,” said Jason Shepherd, a former GOP chairman in suburban Atlanta’s Cobb County who has exited state party affairs because of his disagreements with Trump supporters.\n\nState convention delegates will choose one man and one woman to the national party’s governing body on Saturday in Columbus. It’s not as if the incumbents seeking reelection are Trump critics. Jason Thompson and Ginger Howard trumpet their allegiances. Thompson, an attorney, was among the lawyers who helped Trump ask courts for recounts and favorable treatment after Election Day in 2020.\n\nThompson and Howard are both calling for the national party to repay the state party more than $1.5 million it has spent defending the 16 fake Trump electors. Three have been indicted by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, while others reached immunity deals to testify for prosecutors.\n\nREAD OUR FULL COVERAGE OF THE TRUMP INDICTMENT\n\nBut they also warn that Georgia Republicans need experienced leaders who can obtain resources to win the November election in a battleground where wins by Biden and two Democratic U.S. senators have shaken a generation of Republican control.\n\n“There’s more to the RNC than just the election integrity part,” Thompson said April 24. “Obviously, I think that’s the most important part, especially right now. But you also have to have somebody that can raise money.”\n\nHoward is under fire, basically, for being insufficiently confrontational.\n\n“Don’t mistake my sweetness for weakness. I’m a fighter,” Howard said.\n\nJosh McKoon, a former lawmaker elected last year as chair, has tried to dampen some conflicts. He explicitly endorsed Howard at the April 24 meeting, saying she’s doing an “excellent job.”\n\nThompson is being attacked by opponents for work done by his wife and daughter for Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who is despised by Trump and party activists for his defense of Georgia’s 2020 results.\n\n“It’s the appearance of being associated with the devil himself and that’s Brad Raffensperger,” one activist told Thompson last month.\n\nThompson says neither his wife nor daughter have anything to do with how Raffensperger runs elections, calling it “ridiculousness” to imply his family benefits from Georgia’s use of Dominion Voting Systems ballot-marking devices. Many Republicans demand Georgia use ballots marked and counted by hand, citing distrust of machines fanned by conservatives.\n\nThompson’s challengers include party Second Vice-Chairman David Cross and Jason Frazier, who was denied a Republican place on Fulton County’s election board because Frazier has challenged the eligibility of thousands of voters.\n\nCross is among a group of anti-establishment officers elected last year. Cross supported retaining First Vice-Chairman Brian K. Pritchard, who was removed on May 10 by the state Republican Committee after a judge found Pritchard voted illegally nine times. Many Republicans viewed the findings as undercutting their arguments that the state must prevent fraudulent voting.\n\nCross argues the current leaders aren’t representing what Republicans want, saying pro-Trump forces need to complete their takeover.\n\n“One of the major issues that we need to be dealing right now is grassroots engagement,” Cross told party members Monday in Forsyth County, a Republican stronghold north of Atlanta. “There are a lot of people out there who are severely demoralized.”\n\nFrazier argues his experience scrutinizing voter rolls is an asset the RNC needs. Even as the party has been slow to invest in voter outreach, it has pledged a 100,000-person election-integrity program. Thompson claims partial credit, promising there will be lawyers “everywhere” to challenge Democrats, but Frazier says it’s not enough.\n\n“Election integrity needs to be one of the top, if not the top, issue if we’re going to win in future elections,” Frazier said April 24. “It has not been a top priority in the past.

The wife of David Cross said Monday that her lack of experience is a strength.\n\n“It takes more people to stand up and not just vote. Voting is not enough,” Shawn Cross said. “The system is rigged, we all know it’s rigged.”\n\nIt’s that sense of grievance and desire for confrontation that all the challengers are counting on.\n\n“We never went to the Capitol,” Kremer said on April 24. “We didn’t tell people to go to the Capitol. But the thing was, the people wanted to do something. So people marched to the Capitol. And we all know what’s happened since then. The federal government has been weaponized against us.”\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.",

        "content": "ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - At Morehouse College on Friday, graduating seniors strolled around campus in their caps and gowns, posing for pictures and taking in their final hours as college students.\n\nBut looming over what appeared to be a typical scene just two days before the historically Black college’s commencement ceremony was a sense of tension.\n\nFor weeks, some students and faculty members at the storied school have been urging administration to reconsider their choice to have President Joe Biden speak as their keynote commencement presenter. Because of his administration’s staunch support of Israel in their ongoing conflict against Hamas — and the ensuing humanitarian crisis involving the Palestinian people — they don’t want the president on campus.\n\n“I feel a sense of betrayal,” said Morehouse sophomore Anwar Karim, his head draped in a keffiyeh, a traditional Middle Eastern headscarf. “It just feels like there’s a blatant and intentional aversion and ignorance of us as students and, that hurts.”\n\nKarim was one of a handful of students who protested Friday ahead of Biden’s arrival at the school. His planned Sunday commencement address has drawn similar demonstrations at the school known for activist alumnae including Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Julian Bond.\n\n“This is a moment where our moral fortitude comes into play,” said Karim. “You really have to think about where you stand as a person regardless of where you come from or what you believe in.”\n\nOthers were looking forward to having Biden on campus.\n\n“Having a president, a standing president deliver your commencement address is obviously historical,” said graduating senior Dawson Cox.\n\nDr. David Thomas, president of Morehouse College, said he would respect peaceful and silent protests during Biden’s address Sunday, but would also be prepared to stop commencement ceremonies on the spot if things get disruptive.\n\nRELATED: Morehouse faculty approves honorary degree on President Biden ahead of visit\n\n“I had students ask me about it, what if we, you know, turned our backs on the president or turned our chairs? And I said to them, I’ll be embarrassed, but that’s not your problem,” said Thomas. “Long as you don’t conduct yourself in a way that deprives others from being able to participate, consume, and celebrate this moment for their graduates.”\n\nAhead of his trip to Morehouse on Sunday morning, Biden will hold an event in Atlanta on Saturday with Black voters.\n\nGeorgia is a key battleground state.\n\nAccording to Team Biden-Harris, they have 10 campaign offices opening across the state by the end of May.\n\nTo that point, the president’s visit to Morehouse may have its political benefits too. The Black voting bloc in metro Atlanta delivered him a historic victory in Georgia in the 2020 election, and he’ll need the same support if he hopes to win the state again in 2024.\n\nBut some Morehouse students say he’ll have to do more than a speech.\n\n“All of our HBCUs are in predominately Black communities,” said Noah Collier, a Morehouse College senior. “So us as students, we are engaged with these communities, they’re engaged with us. Our politicians need to be doing the same thing.”\n\nAt an event to commemorate the anniversary of the landmark education decision Brown v. Board of Education, Biden touted his connections to Morehouse without mentioning the controversy over his visit this weekend, calling the school “one of our nation’s most important institutions.”\n\n“I got more Morehouse men in my administration than Morehouse,” Biden joked. “The founders of Morehouse understood something fundamental: education is linked to freedom. Because to be free means to have something that no one can ever take away from you.”\n\nPresident Biden was last in the Peach State back in March. He is scheduled to visit again along with former President Donald Trump on June 27 for a debate.\n\nCopyright 2024 WANF. All rights reserved.",

The Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) is spending billions to try and change that.\n\n“Because of the congestion we see in that corridor, so moving forward with that GA-400 express lanes project that will in the long run connect with 285 express lanes on the east side and on the west side,” said Natalie Dale, GDOT’s spokesperson.\n\nThose express lanes will operate similarly to existing ones on I-75 northbound and southbound and on I-85, where drivers will use a Peach Pass to access them.\n\n“Because of the congestion we see in that corridor, so moving forward with that GA-400 express lanes project that will in the long run connect with 285 express lanes on the east side and on the west side,” said Dale.\n\n“I’ve been doing Lyft for a while, I’ve been driving for a while, that could definitely help me out a lot,” said Anderson.\n\nHow much would it cost to use the express lanes?\n\n“That pricing is market driven based on how many people want to use it,” said Dale.\n\n“Well, the rich will be over there. The regular people will be on the right side,” said David Glasco. “That sounds like a money grab.”\n\nEven if drivers opt out using the express lanes, Dale says they’ll benefit.\n\n“We saw time saving across the board. So you, you certainly have that reliable trip when you choose to use the express lane system. However, you also get a residual benefit from the managed lane system because we’re sort of moving vehicles out of that when they choose to take it,” said Dale.\n\nConstruction should start by fall of next year.\n\nCopyright 2024 WANF.

The instrument is popular in the Arabic world but seldom seen in America.\n\n“It’s not an easy instrument to play, but it’s a beautiful instrument,” Abdelhamid said.\n\nThe Atlanta International Night Market isn’t going to price people out with $20 funnel cake, either. Vendors must have multiple items for $5 or less to promote inclusivity and get more people to participate.\n\n“Lecturing will only go so far,” Abdelhamid said. “Talking to somebody will only go so far.

(Atlanta News First) - A metro Atlanta daycare is staying open after an Atlanta News First Investigates story resulted in $60,000 in back payments coming its way from a state-operated tuition assistance program.\n\n“Without your involvement, I wasn’t getting any answers,” said Chrystalyne Rivera, owner of A Step Above Preparatory Academy, whose two locations are in in southwest Atlanta near College Park and another in Conyers.\n\nBecause of a change in how Georgia operates its tuition assistance program, Rivera had to lay off her janitorial staff because she ran out of money and was facing an overall closure of her business.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE FROM BETTER CALL HARRY\nMetro daycare may close if Georgia doesn’t reimburse missed tuition payments\n\nNinety-five percent of the children enrolled at A Step Above Preparatory Academy receive tuition assistance from Georgia’s CAPS program, which provides nearly $63 million annually to about 50,000 low-income Georgia families. Each week, daycares around the state receive CAPS reimbursement payments through the Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning (DECAL).\n\nHowever, this past November, DECAL decided to streamline the CAPS program, which is also managed by its outside payment vendor, Maximus.\n\n“We simply brought the provider management function in-house with a new system called GACAPS,” said DECAL spokesperson Reg Griffin. “This is providing streamlined services and increasing personal service for providers.”\n\n“For more than 20 years, Maximus has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the well-being of children, families, and childcare providers in Georgia,” a company spokesperson said. “We stand ready to support the Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning.”\n\nBut when DECAL transitioned to its new system, it created chaos for many daycares, which were used to receiving weekly payments.\n\nMany complained in a private Facebook Group called Quality Rated Providers of Georgia. A DECAL spokesperson said the new system doesn’t work perfectly even now - six months after the launch.\n\n“We understand the importance of timely compensation for the valuable services provided by our CAPS childcare providers and are doing everything possible to resolve any payment issues going forward,” Griffin said.\n\nRivera said at least five payments totaling more than $100,000 still need to be included, three in April and two from last year.\n\nAfter Atlanta News First Investigates contacted DECAL’s spokesperson for help, Rivera received a call from an account specialist who researched her account and confirmed A Step Above Daycare should receive at least two payments soon, enough to keep Rivera’s doors open.\n\nThose payments totaling $60,000 have been received, with the rest of the back payments promised to be on the way.\n\nIf there’s something you would like Atlanta News First′s Consumer Investigator Better Call Harry to look into, fill out this submission form.\n\nCopyright 2024 WANF.

(Atlanta News First) - Management of Elleven45 Lounge in Buckhead, where two people were killed in Sunday’s shooting, also operated the Encore Hookah Bar & Bistro, a downtown Atlanta nightclub that shut down in 2022.\n\nAtlanta News First found business records connecting the two establishments, both operated and managed by Djibril Dafe.\n\nDafe is listed as a party in a 2022 lawsuit filed by the City of Atlanta against the Encore Hookah Bar.\n\nRELATED: 2 killed, 4 injured in Buckhead nightclub shooting, police say\n\nThe city cited safety concerns for urging a judge to close the establishment.\n\nAccording to the city, the Atlanta Police Department was called more than 171 times to Encore between February 2020 and April 2022.\n\nA hearing for the lawsuit was held on April 20, 2022, and as a result of the hearing, Encore agreed to cease doing business and vacate the property.\n\nEarlier this week, two city sources confirmed with Atlanta News First that the city has launched an investigation into Elleven45 Lounge following Sunday’s shooting.\n\nOne potential outcome of the investigation is permanently closing the club.\n\nIn a zoning permit application, acquired by Atlanta News First and dated September 7, 2023, Dafe is also listed as the primary applicant for Elleven45 Lounge, located at 2110 Peachtree Street NW.\n\nIn a phone call on Friday, property owner Lee Nicholson confirmed Dafe managed Elleven45 Lounge.\n\nNicholson was critical of how the city and the media have addressed the nightclub following Sunday’s shooting, saying the attention is racially motivated.\n\n“When a shooting happens in any establishment frequented by white people in this city, the focus is on the shooter, not the location,” Nicholson said in a text message to Atlanta News First. “The only reason the media is focusing on the location and not catching the mass shooter who is at large in our city is because the victims and the club owner and the clientele are predominantly Black. This is systemic racism at its absolute worst. Black Lives Matter to me. I wish also they mattered to the media.”\n\nIn a phone call, Nicholson defended the property’s safety in recent years.\n\nRELATED: ‘I miss her so much’: Shooting victim’s sister wants city to shut down ‘not safe’ Buckhead nightclub\n\nAtlanta News First acquired a list of 911 calls to the property, dating back to June 2020 to today.\n\nOutside of Sunday’s shooting, Atlanta police were called for two other shootings, 35 fights, and 38 noise concerns.\n\nOn Friday, the family of two of the victims announced they plan to take legal action against Elleven45 Lounge.\n\nMichael Sterling Sr., the attorney representing the families, said the club was negligent in ensuring basic safety for those entering the club.\n\nRELATED: City of Atlanta investigation could shut down Buckhead nightclub after deadly shooting\n\n“Someone got in there with a gun because someone failed to find that gun and they were negligent in their basic responsibility,” said Sterling.\n\nSterling is representing the family of Mari Creighton, who died in the shooting. He is also representing the family of Taylor Holmes, the niece of Creighton who was also shot on Sunday.\n\nHolmes was released from the hospital on Thursday and is expected to be okay.\n\nSterling said security at the door took Creighton’s mace. The families want to know how someone with a gun was able to get inside.\n\nRELATED: City of Atlanta to take ‘any necessary action’ following deadly shooting at Buckhead nightclub\n\nOn Friday, the Atlanta mayor’s office released a statement confirming their investigation into the nightclub.\n\n“First and foremost, the mayor’s thoughts are with the families of those affected by this tragic and senseless act of gun violence,” said a spokesperson for the mayor’s office. “Following the incident and at the mayor’s direction, we are looking into a number of matters involving the property and working with the appropriate departments and agencies to take any necessary action. There are several tools at the mayor’s disposal, and he will not hesitate to leverage any of them to keep our communities safe and thriving. These are ongoing investigations, and the city will provide further updates when possible.”\n\nCopyright 2024 WANF. All rights reserved.",

Then I have to go to another hotel, I have another deposit,” she said.\n\nAccording to the Southern Poverty Law Center more than 25,000 lower-income people in metro Atlanta are mostly families using motels as permanent housing.\n\n“A lot of times, they might find themselves in motels because of credit barriers, their credit may not qualify them for an apartment, or it could be how they show their proof of income,” said Mary Grace King, Frontline Housing Inc. executive director.\n\nKing said each participant is required to take a six month course on financial literacy.\n\n“We really try to incorporate a saving program with our housing program so that families stay stable once they are placed in housing,” King said.\n\nWashington and her family moved into a five-bedroom house in DeKalb County last November.\n\nWashington said the program has offered her family a new beginning.\n\n“I just feel like for me they were a blessing,” she said.\n\nFor more information on the Motel to Home Alliance program, click here.\n\nCopyright 2024 WANF.

So, this is probably about 10 times better than Georgia code.”\n\nAndrew Goings is a custom home builder with Home and Made Custom Home Builders who’s been leading his team on the project.\n\nOver the last two years, he’s been working hard to ensure the house is uniquely insulated and air-sealed.\n\nLooking ahead, Goings’ goal is to build better homes in Georgia for the future.\n\n“We’re trying to convey to future homeowners how much the energy savings and cost-benefit could really help them out in the long run,” he said.\n\nAccording to Goings, PHIUS passive-certified houses provide energy savings between 40-60% compared to other homes.\n\nWith only one other PHIUS-certified house in the entire southeast United States, Georgia is now the second state to adopt the future of green, zero-carbon building.\n\n“That’s a huge accomplishment for us and for the PHIUS organization as a whole,” Goings said. “We’re really starting to ramp up in the Southeast.”\n\nA couple has already secured the home, buying it for a total price of $1.3 million.\n\nHome and Made Custom Home Builders already has plans to build two more passive homes in the area.\n\nCopyright 2024 WANF.

Renovations on the building are expected to start in the next few weeks.\n\n“At the end of the day, it is about making ourselves available to the veterans in the area,” said Mableton Mayor Michael Owens.\n\nTunnel to Towers has created housing for veterans in need across 10 other states.\n\nCopyright 2024 WANF.

        "content": "ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - Right now, Zoo Atlanta is the only place you can see giant pandas in the United States — but that privilege won’t last for much longer.\n\n“It would be nice if we could keep them on loan for a while longer for all the kids to see,” A Zoo Atlanta visitor said.\n\nThe four bears will return to China in the fourth quarter of 2024, the zoo confirmed on Friday. Zoo officials have applied for international travel permits for Lun Lun, Yang Yang, Ya Lun and Xi Lun.\n\nLun Lun and Yang Yang were loaned to Atlanta in 1999, but the zoo’s contract with Chinese officials has expired.\n\nYa Lun and Xi Lun are twins and two of the pair’s seven children. The others have already been sent to China’s Chengdu Research Center of Giant Panda Breeding.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: Atlanta is the last place to see giant pandas in the U.S. — but maybe not for long\n\nThe zoo said it will give “significant advance notice” of when the giant pandas are leaving so guests can see the bears one last time.\n\n“While Zoo Atlanta remains committed to the stewardship and long-term conservation of the species, no discussions have yet taken place with partners in China as to the future of the Zoo’s giant panda program following the expiration of Zoo Atlanta’s current agreement,” the zoo said in a statement.\n\nThis year marks the 25th anniversary of the zoo’s giant panda program. The zoo plans to celebrate with a “Summer of Celebration,” kicking off on June 1 with cultural performances and educational activities from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. The event is included in a regular ticket purchase.\n\nSince the program began, the zoo has contributed more than $17 million to giant panda conservation. That includes donations to nature reserves, reforestation plans, genetic diversity studies and more, the zoo said.\n\nGiant pandas are listed as a vulnerable species, with fewer than 1,900 remaining in the wild. Most exist on nature reserves, according to the zoo.\n\nZoo Atlanta became the last remaining U.S. zoo with giant pandas when the Smithsonian’s National Zoo returned its three giant pandas to China in November 2023.\n\n“It’s a great attraction and everybody loves pandas. They’re big fluffy animals. I mean who doesn’t want to see a panda eat some bamboo and roll around you know,” Zoo Atlanta visitor Jaylin Jackson said.\n\nBut the United States won’t be bear-less. The China Wildlife Conservation Association announced that the San Diego Zoo will receive two bears in the summer of 2024. The association is also in talks with a zoo in Washington, D.C.\n\n“We look forward to further expanding the research outcomes on the conservation of endangered species such as giant pandas, and promoting mutual understanding and friendship among peoples through the new round of international cooperation,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.\n\nCopyright 2024 WANF.

        "content": "(AP) - A media personality who co-founded a conservative political action committee has been appointed to a seat on the Georgia State Election Board, which is responsible for developing election rules, investigating allegations of fraud and making recommendations to state lawmakers.\n\nGeorgia House Speaker Jon Burns, a Republican, on Friday announced the appointment of Janelle King to the board, effective immediately. She replaces Ed Lindsey, a former Republican state lawmaker, who resigned his seat after having served on the board since 2022.\n\n“Janelle will be a tremendous asset as an independent thinker and impartial arbiter who will put principle above politics and ensure transparency and accountability in our elections, and I look forward to her work on behalf of the people of Georgia,” Burns said in a news release announcing King’s appointment.\n\nKing is the third new member appointed this year to the board, which has four Republican members and one Democrat. In January, Gov. Brian Kemp appointed Waffle House executive John Fervier to chair the board, and the state Senate approved the nomination of former state Sen. Rick Jeffares. Janice Johnston is the Republican Party appointee to the board, and Sara Tindall Ghazal is the Democratic Party appointee.\n\nKing and her husband, Kelvin King, co-chair Let’s Win For America Action, a conservative political action committee. Kelvin King ran for U.S. Senate in 2022 but lost in the Republican primary.\n\nJanelle King has previously served as deputy state director of the Georgia Republican Party, as chair of the Georgia Black Republican Council and as a board member of the Georgia Young Republicans. She appears on Fox 5 Atlanta’s “The Georgia Gang,” has a podcast called “The Janelle King Show” and has been a contributor on the Fox News Channel.\n\nDespite her history as a Republican operative, King said she plans to use facts and data to make the right decisions while serving on the board.\n\n“While my conservative values are still the same personally, when it comes to serving, I believe that I have to do my job,” she said in a phone interview Friday. “So I think I’m going to show people over time that I am fair, I am balanced and that I’m able to put my personal feelings to the side when necessary if that’s what it takes to make the best decision.”\n\nThe State Election Board has had an elevated profile since the 2020 election cycle resulted in an increased polarization of the rhetoric around elections. Its meetings often attract a boisterous crowd with strong opinions on how the state’s elections should be run and the board members sometimes face criticism and heckling.\n\nKing said that wouldn’t faze her: “Look, I’m a Black conservative. Criticism is nothing for me. I am not worried about that at all.”\n\nRecent meetings have drawn scores of public comments from Republican activists who assert that former President Donald Trump was the rightful winner of the 2020 election. They are calling for major changes in Georgia’s elections, including replacing the state’s touchscreen electronic voting machines with paper ballots marked and counted by hand.\n\nKing declined to comment Friday on her feelings about the state’s voting machines, but in a February episode of her podcast she said she has seen “no proof of cheating on the machines” and that she wasn’t in favor of an exclusively paper ballot system.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The lawsuit also states that Propst filed a formal complaint against Shropshire.\n\nPropst was fired on Jan. 30 by Municipal Court Judge Rashida Oliver — one day after the city council voted to remove Propst as a department head and report directly to Oliver, the lawsuit states. The lawsuit also says Oliver was given a $40,000 raise during that Jan. 29 meeting.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that the two violated East Point ordinances prohibiting city councilors from using their positions to retaliate against city employees and using coercion to give benefits to family members.\n\n“The law does not permit public officials to weaponize the full weight of their trusted offices to destroy the lives of employees who submit good faith complaints about wrongdoing.

(Atlanta News First/AP) - Friday, May 17 is the last day for early voting in Georgia’s general primary.\n\nNext week’s election will set the ballot for Georgia’s battleground Nov. 5, 2024, election. Voters will choose nominees for the U.S. House and the state legislature, as well as decide whether one of Trump’s prosecutors will keep her job.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who is leading the prosecution of Trump in a 2020 election interference case, faces challenger Christian Wise Smith in the Democratic primary. Smith is an attorney and author who ran against Willis four years ago.\n\nThe judge in the case is also up for reelection. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee faces Robert Patillo, an attorney and radio host, in the nonpartisan race. McAfee is a former prosecutor who was appointed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in 2022.\n\nGeorgia has neither a governor’s race nor a Senate race on the ballot in 2024, so the state’s 14 congressional districts are the only federal races with primaries on Tuesday. The only open seat is in the solidly Republican 3rd Congressional District, held by retiring incumbent Drew Ferguson.\n\nOf the remaining 13 incumbents, 10 are running uncontested in their primaries. The other three are Democrats Lucy McBath and David Scott and Republican Barry Loudermilk. McBath is seeking the Democratic nomination in the 6th Congressional District, a west Atlanta district that was redrawn in redistricting. She represents the 7th Congressional District.\n\nScott has represented the 13th District for more than two decades, though his district, like McBath’s, changed significantly in redistricting. His primary has attracted the largest field. Loudermilk, who represents the 11th District, has two challengers in the Republican primary.\n\nGeorgia’s state primary election will be held Tuesday, May 21. Polls close at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nGeorgia's new congressional districts\n\nHere’s what you need to know about early voting from the Georgia Secretary of State website:\n\nAm I registered to vote?\n\nYou must first be registered to vote in the state of Georgia. Visit the Georgia Secretary of State’s website to verify that you are listed as active. If you’re not registered to vote, learn how to register now.\n\nWhere do I vote early?\nUnlike Election Day, you do not have to vote at an assigned polling location during early voting. You may vote at any early voting location within your county. Find available early voting locations by visiting the Secretary of State’s website and selecting your county of residence from the list. You can also find available locations by logging into your My Voter Page and looking at your polling place information.\nWhen you arrive at your early voting location, you’ll need to bring a valid photo ID such as a driver’s license, passport, or voter identification card.\n\nAtlanta News First and Atlanta News First+ provide you with the latest news, headlines and insights as Georgia continues its role at the forefront of the nation’s political scene.

(Atlanta News First) - Businesses on Lake Lanier are preparing for peak season.\n\n“It picks up a lot as we’re coming into Memorial Day,” said Heidi Moore with Skier’s Marine and MasterCraft Boats.\n\nShe has spent 25 years working the lake and knows boating isn’t as easy as it seems.\n\n“You know, you don’t just get out and drive zigzags across it,” she said.\n\nLake Lanier has a reputation as a “cursed lake.” Moore scoffs at the idea.\n\n“Lake Lanier is definitely not haunted,” she said.\n\nBut you could forgive someone for thinking it so. From 1994-2022, more than 200 people died on Lake Lanier, most of those from drowning.\n\nMoore says it doesn’t need to be that way.\n\n“If you’re 12 and under, you need to be wearing a life jacket,” Moore said.\n\nThe rules of boating aren’t that different from driving. There’s right-of-way, rules of the road, and licenses.\n\n“You can’t drive a boat until you’re 16 and have taken a boater safety course,” Moore said.\n\nIf you were born after 1997, you’re required to take that course.\n\nYou also need one Coast Guard-approved life jacket per person.\n\nThe biggest red flag, by far, is one most people associate with boating: alcohol.\n\nResearch has shown that up to 70% of drowning victims have alcohol in their blood. The Coast Guard estimates that one-third of all boating fatalities are alcohol-related.\n\n“One of the other things people forget to do is check the weather before they go,” Moore added.\n\nThat might sound basic, but choppy water can wreak havoc on boats and boaters.\n\nFor more on boating safety, click here.\n\nCopyright 2024 WANF.

His coach, Thomas Ballester, said he was doing Lyft to raise more money for his wrestling career.\n\n“A lot of little kids looked up to him,” Ballester said. “He was a role model.”\n\nBallester showed Atlanta News First a video of Folks dancing in the ring with a group of kids who came to watch him.\n\n“I just wish I would’ve told him I was proud of him more,” he said.\n\nUnion City Police said Folks picked Minor up through Lyft to bring him home the morning of May 15. Minor had been on administrative leave with Atlanta Police since being arrested on an unrelated charge in Milton in December 2023.\n\nAccording to the arrest warrants obtained by Atlanta News First, Minor believed his driver “is in a gay fraternity and was trying to recruit Minor into it and believed he was getting kidnapped by Folks.”\n\nIt goes on to say, “He heard what he thought was another voice in his ear talking to him, but did not say what the voice said.”\n\nMinor told police he thought Folks was speaking an “unknown language” and told him he wanted to get out of the car. When Folks reached the intersection of Stonewall Tell Road and South Fulton Parkway, Minor attempted to unlock the car. When he could not, he told police he shot Folks in the head.\n\nFriends of Folks, like fellow wrestler Christian Turner, said they could not believe this happened to him.\n\n“The last time I saw him was Monday. He was very hyped. He was showing everyone his brand new shirt, because he had made his first professional wrestling shirt,” Turner said.\n\nEven though he went by the wrestling name “Reggie Rage,” he was described as always happy.\n\n“A good soul. Life of the party,” Turner said. “He had a smile on his face every day.”\n\n“We will just keep going, because that’s what he would want,” he said.\n\nBallester said they would be arranging a wrestling tournament in memory of Folks.\n\nLyft released a statement saying they would be assisting law enforcement with whatever they needed during the course of the investigation.\n\nMinor is being held in the Fulton County Jail, charged with murder and aggravated assault.\n\nCopyright 2024 WANF.

(Atlanta News First) - The family of Senior Airman Roger Fortson, who was fatally shot by a Florida deputy, spoke out Thursday.\n\nFortson, a 23-year-old active-duty airman from DeKalb County, died at his off-base residence, the U.S. Air Force said.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: Airman from DeKalb County shot, killed by deputy in Florida, military says\n\nBody camera video released by the Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office shows the interaction between the deputy and Fortson.\n\nThe family and lawyer for 23-year-old Airman Roger Fortson are demanding transparency, while the Okaloosa County Sheriff says they're being transparent.\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Fortson’s family, believes law enforcement burst into the wrong unit while responding to the call and “used excessive force to execute him.”\n\nThe sheriff’s office claims the deputy “reacted in self-defense after he encountered a 23-year-old man armed with a gun.”\n\n“As long as they [the sheriff’s office] continue to say that they went to the right apartment, they are staining his reputation because Roger did not have any domestic disturbance. Roger had no criminal history. Roger has never ever been accused of domestic violence,” Crump said at a press conference with Fortson’s family Thursday.\n\nCrump said Fortson was on a Facetime call with a woman at the time of the encounter. According to Crump, the woman on the call said Fortson was alone in his apartment when he heard a knock at the door. He asked who was there but didn’t get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn’t see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman’s account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which he legally owned.\n\n“As Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed, and shot him six times,” Crump said in a statement. “The woman said Fortson was on the ground, saying, ‘I can’t breathe,’ after he was shot.”\n\n“There’s nobody better than him,” Fortson’s mother, Meka Fortson, said. “Roger was light. There would not be a stain on his name. He will not be put to rest in darkness, because he was light.”\n\n“Tell the truth and give my child justice,” she added.\n\nWATCH THE FAMILY’S FULL REMARKS:\n\n“At this time, we humbly ask for our community’s patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,” Okaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden said in a statement following the shooting.\n\nFortson’s remains were returned to his home in metro Atlanta on Tuesday. Funeral services are scheduled for Friday at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Stonecrest.\n\nAs of Thursday afternoon, the Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office had not yet responded to the family’s press conference.\n\nCopyright 2024 WANF.

        "content": "ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - Brian Pritchard, the ousted state Republican party leader who voted nine times illegally while making repeated claims of fraud in the 2020 election, said he was unaware he was still on probation when he cast ballots in Georgia.\n\n“No one should ever vote illegally, you with me,” Pritchard said during an exclusive interview with Atlanta News First. “Anyone in America today, in all these states could possibly vote, unknowing they’re doing something. Anyone could.”\n\nPritchard, who was convicted on counts of forging checks in 1996, was given probation until 1999. It was then extended twice, according to court records, to last until 2011.\n\nBut Pritchard voted in nine Georgia primary, general and runoff elections between July 2008 and November 2010 all while on probation. In Georgia, it is illegal for people on felony probation to vote.\n\nMORE COVERAGE:\nGeorgia Republicans remove officer found to have voted illegally\nGeorgia GOP chair calls on top party official to resign\n\nPritchard claimed he never spoke to a probation officer and moved several times over the course of his probationary period. He removed himself from the voter rolls when he was alerted to his illegal voting in 2014, years after his probation had ended.\n\nIt sparked an investigation that ended in March, with Georgia Administrative Judge Lisa Boggs ruling that Pritchard’s claim of ignorance was neither “credible or convincing.”\n\n“Even if the court accepts (Pritchard) did not know about his felony sentences, the record before this court demonstrates that he should have known,” Boggs wrote.\n\nCourt documents show Pritchard was present in Pennsylvania court in 2002 and 2004 at hearings where his probationary period was extended.\n\nCalls for his resignation after the March decision poured in, even from some high-profile Republicans.\n\n“Brian Pritchard must resign immediately,” said Georgia’s ultraconservative Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene on Twitter. “At a time when the Georgia Republican Party is successfully building its effort to protect our state from a total Democratic takeover, it is unacceptable for our party to have a man in leadership who has repeatedly committed voter fraud himself.”\n\n>> WATCH FULL INTERVIEW:\n\nPritchard was elected to serve as the Georgia Republican Party’s first vice chairman last year and even served on the party’s election security task force.\n\nOn Friday, with over 80% of the party’s delegates voting for his removal, Pritchard was ousted from his leadership position.\n\n“I don’t know how I can talk to you or others with any kind of authority on election integrity if I’m going to be defending someone who engaged in that pattern of conduct,” said Georgia GOP chairman Josh McKoon.\n\nMcKoon said Pritchard first made him aware of his voting issues last year, the same week Pritchard was elected first vice-chair.\n\n“Last summer our discussion was look, I’ve been accused of these things, they’re not true, I’ve got a defense, give me an opportunity to present my defense in court,” said McKoon. “He told me he had a legitimate defense. If I’m guilty of anything, it’s believing Brian Pritchard.”\n\nU.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, left, called for Brian Pritchard, right, to resign from his role as vice chairman of the Georgia Republican Party.

In the early afternoon, Benjamin said Morehouse faculty voted to confer an honorary degree on the president.\n\nLast month, Morehouse announced it had invited Biden to become the second sitting American president to deliver Morehouse College’s commencement address, following in the footsteps of his former boss, Barack Obama. Biden is scheduled to deliver the school’s graduation speech on Sunday, May 19, at 9 a.m.\n\nIn 2013, then-President Obama — under whom Biden served as vice president — delivered Morehouse’s commencement address for that class.\n\nBut almost immediately after the announcement, students, faculty and alumni began expressing concern over Biden’s visit to the campus. It was over Biden’s unwillingness to call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. An online petition was also started seeking to persuade Morehouse College to rescind its invitation to Biden.\n\nDuring a White House press briefing on Thursday Benjamin said that Biden will be able to hear directly from those at Morehouse College on Sunday.\n\n“I’m sure the president will have a chance to engage with faculty, staff and students while he’s there,” said Benjamin\n\nBiden’s Morehouse address is his second time delivering a commencement address to an HBCU. Last year, Biden spoke at Howard University, the alma mater of Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWhen it comes time for Sunday’s commencement ceremonies, Morehouse College President David A. Thomas detailed what will and will not be allowed.\n\n“We will allow silent non disruptive protest,” said Thomas.\n\nHe added, “we will also not ask police to take individuals out of commencement in zip ties, if faced with the choice I will cease the ceremonies on the spot.”\n\nThis weekend marks the president’s first visit back to the Peach State after a March campaign rally.\n\nBiden’s schedule for Atlanta visit:\n\nSaturday, May 18, 2024\n\n12:30 p.m.: Biden departs Joint Base Andrews en route to Atlanta.\n\n2 p.m.: Biden arrives at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.\n\n4 p.m.: Biden participates in a campaign reception in Atlanta.\n\nSunday, May 19, 2024\n\n9 a.m.: Biden delivers the commencement address at Morehouse College.\n\n11:30 a.m.: Biden departs from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.\n\nAtlanta News First will stream the entire Morehouse College commencement, including President Biden’s remarks.

Francis was elected by a papal conclave in 2013 at the age of 76, leading more than 1.3 billion Catholics across the globe.\n\nThe senator says the two men of God spoke about their shared faith and helping the needy.\n\n“That’s what guides my work every single day in the Senate,” Warnock said. “I was deeply honored to meet not only the leader of the Catholic Church, but a fellow traveler.”\n\nDo you live in an insulin desert?

But then 21-year-old Nicholas Hill allegedly joined from upstairs, stabbing Shahid with a shank made from the building’s structure, according to the sheriff’s office.\n\nShahid was taken to a local hospital, where he later died.

        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — Following the lead of the NBA, the NASCAR Cup Series is planning a five-race, bracket-style tournament in the midst of the 2025 season, beginning with a night event at Atlanta Motor Speedway.\n\nThe tournament, which comes with a $1 million prize to the winner, is part of a new media rights deal that includes TNT.\n\nThe Atlanta-based cable network will broadcast all five races in the tournament, starting with a 400-miler in its home market on June 28, 2025.\n\n“Next year, having $1 million on the line, that’s for sure going to be a goal before the season starts and something that you and your team strategize around and all that,” Kyle Larson said. “I look forward to it. The summer months get stale. Not boring, but it just gets repetitive. You lose some excitement.”\n\nAtlanta, which has produced some of NASCAR’s most thrilling races since the track was redesigned with higher banking, gets the honor of hosting the first tournament race. The remainder of the 36-race schedule will be announced later.\n\nBrandon Hutchison, president and general manager of the Atlanta track, said the venue was eager to host racing after dark after being scheduled for two day races this season. To get the opening event of the new in-season tournament was an added bonus.\n\n“We’ve heard our fans loud and clear,” Hutchison said. “We know that they wanted the night race back. We were excited to even be able to consider being able to give that to them. Then with TNT — a hometown broadcast partner, home track, the first season of the in-season bracket tournament, the first time that’s ever been held in NASCAR — we feel that ... June 28, 2025, is going to be a very exciting time to be at Atlanta Motor Speedway.”\n\nThe tournament is patterned after in-season tournaments that are staged by soccer leagues around the world and were brought to the NBA this season. The Los Angeles Lakers won the inaugural event in December, beating Indiana in a title game held in Las Vegas.\n\nThe NASCAR tournament will feature the top 32 drivers from three seeding races, which will be held just before the Atlanta race and televised by Amazon Prime.\n\nThe drivers will be paired in head-to-head matchups based on seeding, with the winners advancing to the next round in a bracket format that mirrors the NCAA basketball tournaments.\n\nThe field of contenders will be reduced to 16 for Race 2, followed by the quarterfinals in Race 3, the semifinals in Race 4 and the final in Race 5.\n\n“It’s never been a better time to be a fan of motorsports, and this new, first-ever in-season tournament will bring a new competitive dynamic to NASCAR’s summer race weekends,” said Craig Barry, executive vice president and chief content officer of TNT Sports.\n\nHutchison said the Atlanta track will continue to host two races in 2025 though the complete schedule is still pending.\n\nThis season, the 1.54-mile oval in suburban Hampton held the second points race of the year on Feb. 25 — a week after the Daytona 500 — that ended with Daniel Suarez edging Ryan Blaney and Kyle Busch in a three-wide photo finish.\n\nAtlanta’s second race of 2024 is set for Sept. 8 as the kickoff to the NASCAR playoffs. Next year, that race will move up to be part of the in-season tournament instead of the playoff.\n\nIn a post on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, Denny Hamlin called the tournament “such a win for our sport and drivers.” He jokingly added, “I will collect my 1M royalty next season.”\n\nLarson said the tournament will provide a much-needed boost to the doldrums of summer.\n\n“I think this bracket, or whatever you want to call it, is going to add a lot of excitement and more storylines,” he said. “So I love it.”\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "content": "ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - In yet another sign that Georgia is one of the most important states in the nation’s political universe, CNN announced Wednesday it will host a debate between President Joe Biden and Donald Trump on June 27, 2024, in the global news network’s Atlanta studio.\n\nThe debate will air live on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Español, CNN Max and CNN.com, at 9 p.m.\n\nBoth Biden and Trump are the respective, presumptive Democratic and GOP nominees for president, setting the stage for an historic rematch of their 2020 campaigns. They have been polling well within the margins of error for every poll thus far in the election season, making Georgia a virtual toss-up.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won Georgia by less than 12,000 votes.\n\nBiden and Trump also have agreed to a second, Sept. 10, 2024, debate hosted by ABC.\n\nThe quick agreement on the timetable to meet, according to the Associated Press, followed Biden’s announcement he will not participate in fall presidential debates sponsored by the nonpartisan commission that has organized them for more than three decades. Biden’s campaign instead proposed that media outlets directly organize the debates with both candidates.\n\nCNN said no audience would be present during its debate, and moderators and other details would be announced later. A New York Times/Siena/Philadelphia Inquirer poll released this week shows Trump leading Biden in Georgia and four other critical battleground states.\n\nThe polls indicate “an erosion of support for the president among young and nonwhite voters upset about the economy and Gaza,” The New York Times said.\n\nThe polls came only days before Biden will become the second sitting American president to deliver Morehouse College’s commencement address, following in the footsteps of his former boss, Barack Obama, who spoke in 2013.\n\nBiden will deliver the address to the private, all-male HBCU on Sunday, May 19, at 9 a.m. His speech will mark the president’s first visit back to the Peach State after a March campaign rally.\n\nBut almost immediately after the announcement, students, faculty, and alumni began expressing concern over Biden’s visit to the campus. It was over Biden’s unwillingness to call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\nNovember’s election will be the first presidential electoral rematch since 1956. In 1952, Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower defeated Illinois Gov. Adlai Stevenson after then-President Harry Truman chose not to run for a second full term. Four years later, Democrats again nominated Stevenson for the presidency, which led to a second defeat at then-President Eisenhower’s hands.\n\nAmong Republicans, no presidential candidate has ever been nominated for three consecutive elections; Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, was elected president in 1885 and served only one term before being elected to a second term four years later (1885-1889 and 1893-1897). President Franklin Delano Roosevelt holds the record for the most nominations: four.\n\nMore details from the Associated Press:\n\nDisagreements about moderators and debate rules were some of the very questions that prompted the formation of the Commission on Presidential Debates in 1987.\n\nThe two campaigns and television networks had held weeks of informal talks on ways to circumvent the commission’s grip on presidential debates, owing to years of complaints and perceived slights, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nBiden’s campaign had proposed excluding third-party candidates, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., from the debates outright. Under the debate commission’s rules, Kennedy or other third-party candidates could qualify if they secured ballot access sufficient to claim 270 Electoral Votes and polled at 15% or higher in a selection of national polls.\n\nKennedy accused Biden and Trump of “colluding to lock America into a head-to-head match-up that 70% say they do not want.”\n\n“They are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win,” Kennedy said. “Keeping viable candidates off the debate stage undermines democracy.”\n\nCNN held open the door to Kennedy’s participation if he or any other candidate met polling and ballot access requirements similar to the commission’s.\n\nAs recently as Wednesday morning, Trump expressed his desire for a large live audience for his debates with Biden.\n\n“I would strongly recommend more than two debates and, for excitement purposes, a very large venue, although Biden is supposedly afraid of crowds - That’s only because he doesn’t get them,” Trump said. “Just tell me when, I’ll be there.”\n\nTrump has been pushing for more debates and earlier debates, arguing voters should be able to see the two men face off well before early voting begins in September. He has repeatedly said he will debate Biden “anytime, anywhere, any place,” even proposing the two men face off outside the Manhattan courthouse where he is currently on criminal trial in a hush money case. He also has been taunting Biden with an empty lectern at some of his rallies.\n\nTrump’s campaign on Wednesday challenged the Biden campaign to agree to at least two other debates between the two candidates, beside the June and September dates. The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBiden’s campaign has long held a grudge against the nonpartisan commission for failing to evenly apply its rules during the 2020 Biden-Trump matchups — most notably when it didn’t enforce its COVID-19 testing rules on Trump and his entourage.\n\nAtlanta News First and Atlanta News First+ provide you with the latest news, headlines and insights as Georgia continues its role at the forefront of the nation’s political scene.

        "content": "ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - On Wednesday, Fulton County leaders pulled back on a months-long effort to replace the aging Fulton County Jail with a new facility.\n\n“There’s very little collective support overall for building a new jumbo massive facility that’s going to cost in the billions of dollars,” said Commissioner Bob Ellis. “And I think it’s time for us to have a discussion that really reframes this and gets realistic about what can do, what we can afford, and where we want to collectively move forward as a board.”\n\nThe shift comes after County Manager Dick Anderson said state lawmakers showed no interest in pursuing a sales tax to help offset the costs of the new jail.\n\nWithout a sales tax, Ellis said the cost burden would fall solely on Fulton County residents.\n\n“I certainly do not support applying significant amounts of new general fund money that will result in raised millage rates for a new facility,” Ellis said during Wednesday’s board of commissioners meeting.\n\nIn August 2023, the board voted to move forward with finding funding options for a new jail, estimated to cost $1.7 billion.\n\nIn December, the board reviewed the proposal, which included three separate buildings, one dedicated for men, another for women and the third for men’s medical and mental health services.\n\nHowever, on Wednesday, the board made an abrupt pivot, voting against pursuing a project manager for the planned site.\n\nCommissioner Dana Barrett, who supported moving forward with finding a project manager, said the board is backpedaling on addressing the decades-long crisis at the jail.\n\nANF INVESTIGATES\nHow the Fulton County Jail became Georgia’s very own Guantanamo Bay\n\n“There’s no sense in putting a stop to this right now. Once again, it’s slowing things down because we’re looking at a primary (election). We’re looking at a general (election). And people are trying to win votes by keeping taxes low and it’s just a shame,” Barrett said in an interview with Atlanta News First after the vote.\n\nSince August, some commissioners contested that conditions have improved at the jail.\n\nOn Wednesday, the county reported that there are no detainees currently sleeping on the ground at any county facility, as was previously the case.\n\nIn August 2023, the county had roughly 3,600 people in their jail population. On Wednesday, the county reported a jail population of just below 2,700 people. The county has also invested roughly $13 million in renovating cells at the Rice Street location. Those renovations are expected to be complete by early 2025.\n\nMORE FULTON COUNTY JAIL COVERAGE:\nDept. of Justice investigating living conditions, use of force and other issues at Fulton County Jail\nAnother inmate dies at Fulton County Jail; third death this year\nFulton County Sheriff says progress being made, but jail still ‘a Band-Aid on a heart surgery’\nFulton County inmate seriously injured after falling from stairs, sheriff’s office says\nLawmakers meeting to discuss conditions at Fulton County Jail\n\nIt’s unclear what the next step is for Fulton County should it want to continue pursuing a new jail.\n\n“We have now taken a step back, and it’s incredibly frustrating. I feel like it’s a dereliction of duty for us to not do something about this building that’s falling apart.\n\nIn 2022, the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office confiscated more than 1,500 shanks and knives created from parts of the crumbling facility, according to a spokesperson from the Sheriff’s Office.\n\nCopyright 2024 WANF.

Jason Woodard, and the two “quickly became a bonded pair both on and off duty,” the department wrote.\n\nOver the next five years, “the duo made a substantial impact on the department’s efforts to make the community a safer place to work, play, and live.”\n\nJekel was deployed nearly 300 times. He helped the department capture dozens of suspects, including “numerous violent criminals,” locate several missing people, recover 45 items of evidence and seize heaps of illegal drugs.\n\nGwinnett police said some of Jekel’s noteworthy achievements include more than 5,000 grams of methamphetamine seized in 2018, 500 grams of cocaine seized in 2021, 5 kilos of methamphetamine seized in 2022, and 228 grams of fentanyl and 787 grams of methamphetamine seized in 2022.\n\nThen in late 2023, Woodard noticed that Jekel was struggling with one of his hind legs. After he recently underwent surgery, vets suggested that Jekel retire.\n\nGwinnett police said Jekel will live out the rest of his life with his best friend, Woodard.\n\n“We wish him a restful retirement,” the department wrote.\n\nCopyright 2024 WANF.

(Atlanta News First) - A metro Atlanta school is responding to backlash to a controversial assignment.\n\nParents are fuming and questioning the Mount Vernon School in Sandy Springs after their kids were asked about Hitler’s leadership.\n\nThe assignment asked students to rate the attributes of the former Nazi dictator. The school now acknowledges this caused distress and the assignment has now been removed from the curriculum.\n\nHead of School Kristy Lundstrom sent the following statement to Mount Vernon parents:\n\nDear Mount Vernon Family,\n\nI am aware that a screenshot is being circulated on social media and has caused concern and distress. The screenshot is a snapshot taken out of context from a classroom assignment from March 2024. We do not condone positive labels for Adolf Hitler. The intent of the assignment was an exploration of World War II designed to boost student knowledge of factual events and understand the manipulation of fear leveraged by Adolf Hitler in connection to the Treaty of Versailles. When leadership was made aware of how the assignment was written it was removed from the curriculum.\n\nImmediately following this incident, I met with the School’s Chief of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Action, Head of Middle School, and a concerned Rabbi and friend of the School who shared the perspective of some of our families and supported us in a thorough review of the assignment and community impact. We worked to understand the balance of holding a safe environment for students while doing the important work of sharing history to prevent deniers and to be clear about the atrocities committed. Adolf Hitler and the events of this time period are difficult and traumatic to discuss.\n\nIn this very heavy time, when our Jewish students and families have the added stress of world events, we want to be clear that The Mount Vernon School wholeheartedly denounces antisemitism.\n\nOur commitment is to embrace a diverse community where every individual is seen, valued, and heard. Please know that we are here to care for and support your children. We have counselors, faith leaders, and school leaders who have been and will continue to be here to talk to, listen to, and lift up your children.\n\nKristy Lundstrom\n\nCopyright 2024 WANF.

        "content": "ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - Charlene Davis sleeps on her living room floor in Atlanta to help ease her back pain and make it easier to access a drawer full of drugs to help keep her alive.\n\nOver the past few years, doctors amputated fingers from her left hand and implanted a heart monitor. Davis said it’s all connected to a chronic disease she’s had since 2008: type two diabetes.\n\nThe 58-year-said said managing her insulin and other medications takes hours day. “It’s a second job trying to move the medicine, make sure I have a prescription, make sure I have refills,” she said.\n\nDavis has insurance but relies on manufacturer coupons to afford her insulin at $35 a month to manage her diabetes. Without the discount, Davis estimates her insulin would cost about $500 a month.\n\nDavis worries each day the pharmaceutical companies could rescind their discounts at any time. “It would be hard,” she said. “We don’t have a lot now, but we really wouldn’t have anything at that point.”\n\nA survey conducted by the Yale Diabetes Center in 2017 found one in four people reported rationing their insulin due to financial reasons. Davis hasn’t needed to ration insulin yet, but she does reuse needles to save money.\n\nCongress recently capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare, but it doesn’t cover diabetics like Davis, who has private insurance.\n\nAccording to a bipartisan U.S. Senate report released earlier this year, Davis is one of millions of Americans who live in or around insulin deserts across the country. The report identified 813 of these deserts, which the report defines as counties with high rates of diabetes and the uninsured.\n\nThe majority of the deserts are concentrated in the southeast. In Georgia, there are more than 100.\n\nU.S. Sens. Raphael Warnock of Georgia and John Neely Kennedy (R-Louisiana) produced the report and co-sponsored the Affordable Insulin Now Act of 2023, legislation that would cap the price of insulin for everyone at $35 a month.\n\nOn the Senate floor this past November, Warnock shared a story about a constituent with diabetes who bought insulin from strangers she met on Facebook groups, meeting up at Chick-Fil-A restaurants at night.\n\n“These are the kind of stories I’ve heard in my state and across the country and I’m glad that we’re on the path to doing something about it,” Warnock told Atlanta News First Investigates in an exclusive interview.\n\nLacy McGee is the constituent Warnock mentioned on the Senate floor. She attended the 2023 State of the Union address as Warnock’s guest to raise awareness about insulin price disparities.\n\nMcGee can now afford the medication thanks to her husband’s insurance, but said “there’s still a big gap for people that are between jobs or don’t have insurance and a deadly gap in many cases.”\n\nThe largest insulin manufacturers - Sanofi, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk - recently reduced the cost of insulin, but it’s a voluntary move. Warnock wants that price cap the law of the land, and believes he can get the legislation passed the finish line. It failed to pass in the Senate by just three votes last year. “I’m seeing hopeful signs,” Warnock said. “I’m under no false pretenses that any of this is easy.”\n\nIn a Congress seemingly perpetually gridlocked, Davis hopes lawmakers can prioritize what’s important for some of their most vulnerable constituents. “You need to think about the little people and how it affects them and the impact that it has not only on their pockets but on their health,” she said.\n\nAtlanta News First Investigates reached out to the nation’s top three insulin manufacturers for comment on this issue. Here are their responses:\n\nSanofi\n\nThe company did not specifically respond to the proposed legislation, but provided a statement reiterating its commitment to cutting insulin prices. “Sanofi believes insulin should be affordable for all patients, which is why we have a suite of industry-leading support programs to ensure no patient has to pay more than $35 for their Sanofi insulin,” said a spokesperson. Learn more about the company’s discount program.\n\nNovo Nordisk\n\nThe company said it is “aware of the [Affordable Insulin Now Act of 2023] legislation and currently reviewing it,” a company spokesperson said. “We recognize that not all patient situations are the same and we have a number of different insulin affordability offerings available through NovoCare.” Learn more about the company’s discount program.\n\nEli Lilly\n\nThe company did not respond to Atlanta News First Investigates’ request for comment about the pending legislation, but issued a press release in March 2023 about its voluntary decision to cap its costs at $35 a month. “We are driving for change in repricing older insulins, but we know that 7 out of 10 Americans don’t use Lilly insulin,” said David A. Ricks, chair and CEO. “We are calling on policymakers, employers and others to join us in making insulin more affordable.” Learn more about the company’s discount program.\n\nIf there’s something you would like Atlanta News First Investigative Reporter Andy Pierrotti to look into, email investigates@wanf.com.\n\nCopyright 2024 WANF.

She’s a finance manager and has a small candle making business on the side.\n\nShelton admitted she missed obvious clues when renting a split-level ranch from Main Street Renewal, a subsidiary of Amherst based in Austin, Texas.\n\nMain Street Renewal is privately held by investors and owns 45,000 homes in 32 U.S. markets.\n\n“Amherst is a vertically integrated real estate investment, development, and operating platform that aims to reimagine some of the most fragmented and inefficient pockets of U.S. real estate, including single-family residential, mortgage-backed securities, and commercial real estate,” Amherst claims on its website.\n\nAfter making several maintenance requests to prevent her bedroom ceiling from collapsing, Shelton claims the company did not respond to her requests for assistance. Three weeks later, the ceiling collapsed while she was in her bathroom getting ready for work. She called her employer to tell them she’d be late.\n\n“I ran out of the house with sweatpants, wet hair, and a t-shirt and told them to have some grace and mercy for the day because this is what you are going to get,” Shelton said.\n\nAfter the collapse, Shelton said she waited three weeks for repairs. When she tried to keep her TV from falling from the ceiling, it got damaged.\n\n“I tried to catch it, and when I did it literally fell forward and hit me on my head,” Shelton said.\n\nShelton said she even threatened a lawsuit. She said Main Street Renewal hired a “nice couple” to repair the ceiling, but now she said the other side of the ceiling is starting to go.\n\nPrevious coverage from Better Call Harry\n‘Make it right’ | Family continues fighting rental company over moldy, ruined furniture\n\nIt’s not her first disaster. In August 2023, Shelton said the basement sump pump failed, sending water and raw sewage into her son’s bedroom. She hired a remediation company and paid $650 for the cleanup. Shelton claimed a Main Street Renewal subcontractor said he could not start the job for seven days.\n\n“If they don’t show up to do the job, I have to get the job done,” Shelton said. “I have to do something. What am I going to do? Just sit in a house with water piling up and building? I couldn’t even get a call back from Main Street.”\n\nShelton said Main Street Renewal denied her reimbursement claim and the cleaning fee she paid for the damaged ceiling.\n\nThen, on Mother’s Day weekend, it happened again. The sump pump failed, and water and sewage back flowed into the basement.\n\n“I think Main Street (Renewal) needs to figure out their maintenance issues and take people a little more seriously,” Shelton said.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau has issued an alert about Main Street Renewal and logged 1,850 complaints in the last three years.\n\nAtlanta News First Investigates reached out to Main Street Renewal and its parent company Amherst. We received the below response.\n\nWe worked directly with the resident to resolve the issues with the property, and have credited them for the expenses incurred for their temporary relocation and other out-of-pocket costs. We take any concern raised by our residents seriously, and look forward to continuing to serve and support our residents in the Atlanta area.\n\nMain Street Renewal Spokesperson\n\nIf there’s something you would like Atlanta News First′s Consumer Investigator Better Call Harry to look into, fill out this submission form.\n\nCopyright 2024 WANF.

(Atlanta News First) - A Georgia State Patrol trooper fatally shot a suspect during a car chase in Carroll County Tuesday afternoon, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI).\n\nThe Georgia Department of Public Safety, which oversees the Georgia State Patrol, said troopers were assisting the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office with a vehicle pursuit around 3:19 p.m. During the chase, a trooper fired shots at the suspect, who crashed their vehicle, the department said.\n\nA GBI spokesperson soon confirmed that the agency was investigating the shooting, which is customary in situations that involve law enforcement officers who’ve shot someone.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, the GBI released details from its preliminary investigation. The agency said the suspect, identified as 51-year-old Jason Scott Fletcher of Hogansville, was shot and killed near Roopville.\n\nThe GBI said the incident began around 3 p.m., when Carroll County sheriff’s deputies were investigating complaints of mail thefts near the 500 block of Little New York Road, which is near the Whitesburg community.\n\nThe GBI said deputies “encountered Fletcher driving a car and attempted to stop him.” They said Fletcher refused to stop and a chase began.\n\nThe chase continued toward the Roopville area. That’s when deputies asked the Georgia State Patrol for help.\n\nA state trooper responded to the area and tried to use stop sticks on Fletcher’s vehicle at the intersection of Highway 5 and Banks Circle near Roopville.\n\nThe GBI said Fletcher swerved his vehicle and tried to hit the trooper, who fired his handgun at Fletcher, hitting him. Fletcher was taken by ambulance to Tanner Medical Center in Carrollton, where he died from his injuries.\n\nNo officers were injured, according to the GBI.\n\nGeorgia Department of Corrections records show that Fletcher served prison time from 2020 to 2022 for aggravated assault on a peace officer, possession of methamphetamine and marijuana, and other charges.\n\nJason Scott Fletcher, 2019 arrest(Carroll County Sheriff's Office)\n\nThat conviction stemmed from a 2019 incident in which investigators said Fletcher swerved his pickup truck toward three Carroll County deputies who were trying to detain him, confirmed Carroll County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Ashley Hulsey.\n\nThe investigation into Tuesday’s shooting is ongoing. Anyone with information is asked to contact the GBI Regional Investigation Office in Columbus at (706) 565-7888.

(Atlanta News First) - Eighteen months after a fire shut down Vine City’s Walmart, the grocery store is set to reopen on May 22.\n\nThe 75,000-foot location at 835 MLK Jr. Dr. will create 135 jobs and provide the community with much-needed fresh produce and a pharmacy, Walmart said. It’s also the first time Walmart has ever converted a Supercenter, known for its large size and wide variety of services, to a Neighborhood Market, which is smaller and more focused on groceries.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: City leaders address concerns over temporarily closed Vine City Walmart\n\n“When the store closed in Vine City, the community was upset and held a vigil. I immediately met with Walmart leadership and worked with them through a variety of options to re-open the store and ensure this community would not remain a food desert,” Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said in a statement. “I am grateful to Walmart for their commitment to re-invest in our community and join my administration’s efforts to improve the quality of life for our residents.”\n\nThe new Walmart Neighborhood Market will have fresh produce, meat and dairy products, an expanded bakery, a full-service deli, household supplies, health and beauty products and a pharmacy. The pharmacy features five service windows and a larger cooler for carrying on-site medicines and other products, Walmart said.\n\nThe location will also have a new health service room offering vaccines, health screenings, consultations and more.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: Vine City Walmart will reopen, Howell Mill site to close permanently\n\nLimark Tucker, the senior director and market manager overseeing the location’s development, said Walmart had “meaningful discussions” with officials and locals to see what the community needed.\n\n“Then, we got to work building a store that met those necessities,” Tucker said.\n\nTo celebrate the opening, Walmart is also donating $12,500 to employee-chosen causes. That includes $2,000 to the Atlanta Community Food Bank, H.O.P.E. Atlanta, Bearstrong, Inc., H.E.Y. Atlanta and Hands on Atlanta, as well as $2,500 to the Warrior GMR Foundation.\n\nThe Walmart originally closed in December 2022 after an arson, officials said. The Walmart on Howell Mill Road, which closed that same month due to a separate arson, will not return.\n\nDickens, Walmart representatives and other officials will hold a re-opening ceremony at 9 a.m. on May 22. The public is invited to attend the event, which will feature a live DJ, Coca-Cola’s polar bears and Tony the Tiger, and free samples from several snack companies, such as Frito Lay, Nestle and Pepperidge Farm.\n\nCopyright 2024 WANF.

        "content": "ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - The body of a metro Atlanta airman who was fatally shot by a Florida deputy was returned to his family Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force returned Senior Airman Roger Fortson to his family via dignified transfer at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport at 4 p.m.\n\nFuneral services are scheduled for Friday at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Stonecrest.\n\nFortson, 23, was shot and killed at his Fort Walton Beach apartment by an Okaloosa County sheriff’s deputy on May 3.\n\nRELATED: Airman from DeKalb County shot, killed by deputy in Florida, military says\n\nThe deputy was responding to a call of a disturbance in progress, and “reacted in self-defense after he encountered a 23-year-old man armed with a gun,” the sheriff’s office said the day of the shooting.\n\nFortson was taken to a hospital where he died, officials said. The deputy involved was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation into the incident.\n\nOn Thursday, the sheriff’s office released video from the deputy’s body camera. It showed the deputy outside Fortson’s apartment door firing as it was opened by Fortson, who was carrying a handgun pointed downward.\n\nOkaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden presented the video hours after the family of Fortson and civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Fortson’s family, held a news conference, during which they disputed that the deputy acted in self-defense.\n\nCrump said Fortson, originally from DeKalb County, was shot six times.\n\nAutoplay\n1 of 3\nRoger Fortson was a senior airman with the U.S. Air Force.(CBS)\n\nAden rejected Crump’s assertion that the deputy had gone to the wrong apartment, covered the door’s peephole, and did not announce himself.\n\nThe video shows the deputy arriving at the apartment building and speaking to a woman outside who described someone hearing an argument. The deputy then went up an elevator and walked down an outdoor hallway.\n\nRELATED: Body camera video shows fatal shooting of Black airman by Florida deputy in apartment doorway, attorney says\n\nVideo shows the deputy banging on the door and stepping aside, seemingly out of view of the door. He shouted: “Sheriff’s office! Open the door!” twice.\n\nFortson opened the door and could be seen holding what appeared to be a handgun pointed down toward the floor. The deputy shouted, “Step back!” and fired off shots. He then shouted, “Drop the gun! Drop the gun!”\n\n“It’s over there,” Fortson said.\n\n“Drop the gun!” the deputy yelled back.\n\n“I don’t have it,” Fortson said, lying on the ground.\n\nThe deputy then called paramedics on his radio.\n\nCrump released a statement later noting that the officer did not tell Fortson to drop his gun before shooting “multiple times within a split second of the door being opened.”\n\n“We remain adamant that the police had the wrong apartment as Roger was on the phone with his girlfriend for a substantial amount of time leading up to the shooting, and no one else was in the apartment,” the statement said.\n\nCrump also told reporters earlier that Fortson was talking to his girlfriend on FaceTime and that he grabbed his gun because he heard someone outside his apartment. He said that the deputy burst into the apartment, citing the account of the girlfriend, who has not yet been identified.\n\n“The girlfriend acknowledges that even though she initially thought the door was forced open by the police that she stands by her emotional recollection of what happened,” Crump said in a later statement.\n\nIn a clip from the FaceTime video captured by Fortson’s cellphone, the airman can be heard groaning and saying, “I can’t breathe.” A deputy can be heard yelling back at him, “Stop moving!” The phone is pointed at the ceiling and does not show what is going on in the apartment.\n\nAden said he had met with the family Thursday and extended his deepest condolences.\n\n“This result is one we never hope to encounter,” Aden said. “These investigations take time, but I want to assure you that we are not hiding or attempting to cover anything up.”\n\nOfficials said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating. FDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nThe sheriff said the probe was being handled as a criminal investigation and that no determination had been made on whether the deputy’s actions were justified or not. However, the initial news release from the sheriff’s office that described the shooting said that the deputy “reacted in self-defense after he encountered a 23-year-old man armed with a gun.”\n\nFortson’s mother, Chantemekki Fortson, walked into the morning news conference with Crump holding a framed portrait of her son in his dress uniform. She burst into tears as Crump spoke about her son’s death.\n\n“My baby was shot up,” she said.\n\nCrump called the shooting “an unjustifiable killing.”\n\n“For whatever reason, they thought he was a bad guy, but he was a good guy. He was a great guy. He was an exceptional guy,” Crump said. “They took a patriot from us.”\n\nMORE ON FORTSON AND HIS AIR FORCE WING\n\nFortson enlisted in the Air Force after graduating high school, Crump said. He was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field. As a special missions aviator, one of his roles was to load the gunship’s cannons during missions.\n\nThe 1st Special Operations Wing took time from normal duties Monday to process Fortson’s death and “to turn members’ attention inward, use small group discussions, allow voices to be heard, and connect with teammates,” the Wing said in a statement.\n\nIn multiple online forums, a heated debate has spilled out in the week since Fortson was shot: Did police have the right apartment? A caller reported a domestic disturbance, but Fortson was alone. Why would the deputy shoot so quickly? Why would the police kill a service member?\n\nThere are also questions about whether race played a role because Fortson is Black, and echoes of the police killing of George Floyd.\n\nFortson was holding his legally owned gun when he opened his front door, but it was pointed to the floor. Based on body camera footage released by the Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office, the deputy only commanded Fortson to drop the gun after he shot him. The sheriff’s office has declined to identify the responding deputy or his race.\n\n“We know our Air Commandos are seeing the growing media coverage and are having conversations on what happened,” Lt. Gen. Tony Bauernfeind, head of Air Force Special Operations Command, said in a message to unit leaders last week.\n\nOn Friday, many from Fortson’s unit will travel to Georgia to attend his funeral, with a flyover of Special Operations AC-130s planned.\n\nHOW FORTSON’S SHOOTING COMPARES TO RECENT CASES\n\nCrump, based in Tallahassee, Florida, has been involved in multiple high-profile cases of Black people in fatal encounters with law enforcement and vigilantes, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols, George Floyd, and Breonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend in 2020.\n\nFortson’s death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes.\n\nIn 2018, a white Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, who was unarmed, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was convicted of murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a non-emergency call reporting that Jefferson’s front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump represented families in both cases as part of his effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\nCopyright 2024 WANF.

(Atlanta News First) – Levi Riley spent 34 days at the Fulton County Jail before his charges for being there were dismissed.\n\nThe 29-year-old Savannah man, who was booked into jail on April 6, walked out on Friday, May 10, with a sense of relief, yet scarred.\n\n“I ended up getting stabbed, and I ended up getting stabbed in my head,” said Riley, standing outside the Fulton County Jail, in an interview with Atlanta News First.\n\nRiley said while in the county’s custody at the jail, a fight broke out among inmates and he was stabbed inside a jail cell.\n\nHe said he tried to get help from officers, but he said they brushed his concerns aside.\n\n“I’m in a room two days bleeding, just bleeding out,” Riley said.\n\nRELATED: Another inmate dies at Fulton County Jail; third death this year\n\nThe Fulton County Sheriff’s Office confirmed the stabbing incident, but denied the slow response from officers.\n\n“An officer saw the inmate’s injuries and immediately took action so that he received medical attention. There is no indication of when the assault occurred or that it was reported,” said Natalie Ammons, spokesperson for the Fulton County Jail.\n\nRiley was being detained at the jail related to a probation warrant.\n\nIn records acquired by Atlanta News First, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Rachel Krause dismissed his probation warrant on May 9.\n\n“The State has decided not to prosecute this matter. The Court hereby orders that the probation warrant be dismissed and that any probation violation case associated with this matter also be dismissed,” wrote Judge Krause in an order.\n\nAccording to online jail records, Riley was released a day later, on May 10.\n\n“You’re just living here, waiting for a court date. It’s like living in a third world country. I’ve been to prison, I’ve been multiple times. I’ve never been to a place like this,” Riley said.\n\nThe stabbing incident comes a month after another inmate was stabbed to death.\n\nOn April 4, 37-year-old Leonard Fortner died after being stabbed multiple times by inmate Edward Cherry, according to the sheriff’s office.\n\nFortner is one of 13 people who have died at the Fulton County Jail since the beginning of 2023.\n\nRELATED: Inmate dies after being stabbed at Fulton County Jail, sheriff’s office says\n\nIn September, Sheriff Pat Labat brought a group of then-current inmates to a Fulton County Board of Commissioners meeting to provide testimony on their experience at the jail.\n\n“I also had four knives pulled on me at once. I had knives put to my throat, and I had to call my mom telling them, ‘Please wire me some money or I will be killed,’” said one man.\n\nAmmons said officers are instructed to provide treatment and report every stabbing incident.\n\nA supervisor then conducts an investigation into the incident.\n\nAmmons said inmates can then be reclassified or moved to another location if necessary.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Fulton County Board of Commissioners is set to discuss updates surrounding the proposal to build a new jail, what is estimated to cost $1.7 billion.\n\nRiley said he shared his experience with hopes that it helps prevent others from suffering the pain he experienced.\n\n“They need to do something about it. They [officers] act like this is something they’re used to seeing every day. They didn’t even respond. They didn’t even care. I just hope nobody goes through what I went through,” said Riley.\n\nMORE COVERAGE:\n\n‘It’s time for them to do something’: Inmate families speak out after recent Fulton County Jail death\n\nJail staffing, conditions discussed at Fulton County Sheriff candidate forum\n\nFulton County inmate seriously injured after falling from stairs, sheriff’s office says\n\nFulton County Jail problems dominate sheriff candidate townhall in southeast Atlanta\n\nCopyright 2024 WANF.

        "content": "ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - This week, a group of more than 600 Georgians sent a letter addressed to Atlanta’s mayor and city council in support of the ongoing construction of the public safety training center.\n\n“It is our hope that, despite the violent and lawless tactics of the training center’s opponents, you will remain strong in your support of this facility that will promote safer streets and brighter futures in Atlanta,” said the letter, penned by “Atlanta Citizens in Support of Law Enforcement.”\n\nThe facility, coined “Cop City” by critics, has garnered significant opposition, but the letter is one of the strongest signs of support in recent months for the training facility, currently under construction in DeKalb County.\n\nA portion of those who have signed the letter of support. (Our America)\n\nActivists from the national group “Our America” sent the letter late Monday and will gather at Atlanta City Hall on Monday, May 20 ahead of the Atlanta City Council meeting.\n\n“For months, we’ve seen well-funded anarchists and other extremist agitators use violence to drive the false narrative that Georgians don’t support the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center. The truth is the majority of Atlantans and Georgians support the police and want the completion of the public safety training center,” said Our America National Director Gabriel Nadales in an email to Atlanta News First.\n\nIt’s unclear where widespread public sentiment stands surrounding the controversial project.\n\nRELATED: The Atlanta Public Safety Training Center: A timeline of violence, controversy\n\nThe letter includes signatures from 638 Georgians, including 491 from those from the metro Atlanta area, according to Our America.\n\n“As a potential ballot referendum that would kill the center continues to loom, we need to constantly show support for its completion,” said Nadales.\n\nIn September, opponents of the training center turned in a petition to the city with an estimated 116,000 signatures from Atlanta residents who were pushing to let voters decide if the facility should move forward.\n\nRELATED: ‘Cop City’ opponents claim law enforcement abused trans women who were arrested after scaling crane\n\nBased on state law, city officials needed to verify that at least 58,232 of the signatures were from registered Atlanta voters.\n\nIf enough signatures had been deemed valid, the issue would have been added to a ballot for voters to decide.\n\nHowever, the verification was stalled because of legal challenges.\n\nIn recent months, there have been several incidents where critics of the project have targeted construction companies linked to the building of the facility.\n\nIn late March, two people were arrested after chaining themselves to construction equipment in Midtown.\n\nRELATED: Atlanta police announce arrest for arson connected to ‘Cop City’ protests\n\nActivists said the demonstration at the worksite was to demand the contractor cut ties with the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center.\n\n“The message is that there won’t be business as usual so long as the city continues to ignore protesters and the ‘Cop City’ movement,” said a student protestor who did not want to be identified.\n\nRELATED: Dozens arrested at Emory after demonstration protesting Israel-Hamas war, ‘Cop City’\n\nDuring the recent on-campus protests at Emory, demonstrators called for the university to cut ties with any corporations helping fund the training center.\n\nEmory President Gregory Fenves, in a meeting with students after 28 people were arrested during an on-campus rally, said he does not have a position on Atlanta’s planned public safety training center.\n\n>> READ THE FULL LETTER:\n\nOrganizers with Our America, which is a national advocacy organization with headquarters in Virginia, said the completion of the project is beneficial for those outside Atlanta.\n\n“The completion of the training center is not a victory just for the safety of Atlantans, but for the safety of all Georgians, especially since Atlanta sets the tone for other cities and counties throughout the state,” said Nadales.\n\nRELATED: Activists outraged after city releases largely unredacted ‘Cop City’ referendum signatures\n\nAtlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum updated city leaders on Monday on the progress of the facility, which is projected to be at least 70% complete.\n\nSchierbaum said they are on schedule to open phase one of the project in December.\n\nCity leaders are expected to get a walk-through tour of the facility in the coming weeks.\n\nCopyright 2024 WANF.

        "content": "SURPRISE, AZ (AZFamily) — Surprise police have identified the suspect involved in a standoff with authorities that left a 6-month-old baby hospitalized and a home destroyed on Friday.\n\nOn Saturday, Surprise police say 51-year-old Todd Christopher Marchetti was involved in Friday’s hostage situation. His remains were later found in the home, which caught fire after an hours-long standoff.\n\nPolice say it appeared he shot himself in the head. The cause of death is still pending the results of a medical examiner’s report.\n\nThe baby boy, who was shot multiple times, remains in the hospital in critical but stable condition, according to police.\n\nSurprise Police Sgt. Rick Hernandez said it all started when Marchetti broke into the home in the area of Cotton Lane and Cactus Road around 3 a.m. and held the woman and the baby hostage. Police say the woman and baby lived at the home, but Marchetti, the father of the child, did not.\n\nSomehow, she escaped around 11:30 a.m. and went to a construction crew nearby and told them what happened, Hernandez said. They called 911.\n\nMarchetti and the baby were still inside the home when the police arrived.\n\nWhile at the scene, officers heard gunshots. One Surprise Police officer responded by firing a gun toward the house where Marchetti was.\n\nOther officers forced their way into the home and found the baby shot multiple times, Hernandez said.\n\nSurprise police say 51-year-old Todd Christopher Marchetti was involved in Friday’s hostage situation.(Surprise Police Department)\n\nPolice said they didn’t see or talk to Marchetti but rescued the child from inside the house.\n\nThe baby boy was flown to a nearby hospital in serious condition, but police said the victim should survive. He underwent surgery for injuries to his lower body on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe woman was treated on scene for only minor injuries and then was taken to the hospital to be with her child, Hernandez said.\n\n“When a call came in to 911 our officers were ready to put themselves in that line of fire that in the danger for the betterment of that young child. Right now, that child is clinging to life, that child is in surgery, that child to has an opportunity to recover and that is what our officers are focused on right now is that we provided that child the opportunity to recover,” said Hernandez.\n\nArizona’s Family news chopper arrived over the scene and spotted armored SWAT trucks at a home. The home’s garage and windows were destroyed as armed police surrounded the home.\n\nPolice say Marchetti refused to come out of the home and peacefully surrender to police.\n\nAround 3 p.m., the house caught fire with Marchetti still inside. Video from the scene showed how the fire erupted and tore through the home.\n\n“Next thing you know, there was smoke. And after the smoke, there’s a huge ball of fire coming from the back of the house and it just spread from the back all the way to the front,” said Hector Holguin, Arizona’s Family drone operator, who was on the scene when the fire started. “It just progressed. It collapsed the roof.”\n\nBecause Marchetti might still have been in the home, firefighters couldn’t get too close to the flames, which delayed their response. They also heard gunfire coming from inside the house, Hernandez said.\n\n“Firefighters don’t wear bulletproof vests. Firefighters don’t have weapons so they are vulnerable on these kinds of situations so it’s imperative that law enforcement stabilize that scene in such a way that it’s safe to address the fire,” said Andy Anderson, a former assistant Phoenix Police chief.\n\nFirefighters used two ladder trucks to spray the house with water and water down the house next door to keep the flames from spreading.\n\nBy 4:30 p.m., the fire appeared to have been put out, but firefighters were still mopping up hot spots. The cause of the fire is under investigation, Hernandez said.\n\nNeighbors in the new-build community say they are shocked and horrified by what happened. Multiple neighbors who spoke with Arizona’s Family off camera say they’ve passed that house several times and have never noticed anything out of the ordinary.\n\nDeidre Baumann was in town visiting a friend who live directly across the street and was stuck in the home all day and night while everything played out.\n\n“We were standing to the side of the windows or down to the floor because easily a bullet could have traveled through the window watching much of what occurred. The worst part of it was we knew that there was a mother and baby who lived across the street. According to my friend, mother always had baby on her hip,” said Baumann. “It’s very difficult to understand how something like this can happen. How a father can shoot at a six-month year-old baby. That is beyond evil and it’s hard to process to think what the mother must be going through now.”\n\nNeighbors who are affected are asked to call the Surprise Police Department’s non-emergency number at 623-222-4000.\n\nA GoFundMe has been made to help the mother and baby as they recover during this time.

        "content": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — Arizona’s Family is learning more about the victims in the hostage, baby shot, officer-involved shooting, standoff, and fire situation in Surprise from the mother’s best friend.\n\nLinda Ogle says her friend Allie was doing all she could to get out of a domestic violence situation, and no one ever expected it to escalate to this extreme.\n\nIn one day, Allie lost her home and all of her belongings, and she nearly lost her 6-month-old baby, Jaxson.\n\n“Evil. I don’t have any other explanation besides he’s evil,” said Ogle.\n\nOgle calls it a scene out of a horror movie. Allie and Jaxson are living an unimaginable nightmare after police say 51-year-old Todd Marchetti caused a series of tragic events.\n\n“There’s a lot of fear. She was really afraid of him,” said Ogle.\n\nMarchetti is Jaxson’s father and Allie’s boyfriend of a year and a half. Detectives say Marchetti broke into a home in Surprise around 3 a.m. Friday and held Allie and Jaxson hostage.\n\nAllie and her infant son are living an unimaginable nightmare after police say 51-year-old Todd Marchetti caused a series of tragic events.(Courtesy of Allie, Surprise Police Department, Arizona's Family)\n\nOgle says Allie recently moved in there with her parents to try to get away from Marchetti’s abuse, but he was stalking her.\n\n“He used an ax to get through one of the windows,” said Ogle. “He brought duct tape and ropes and different forms of pliers and a couple different butcher knives.”\n\nThe plan was to torture Allie for days while her parents were away for the weekend, according to Ogle, and in the process, she says Marchetti shot the family dog. She says they all went to the vet, but Allie couldn’t escape then.\n\nOgle says Allie convinced him to let her talk to a construction worker after they got back to ask for help fixing the window he broke. That crew called 911, and then police say Marchetti shot his son.\n\n“She saved both of their lives and I’ve told her that multiple times. She said ‘Oh, well I should have just taken Jaxson out of the house with me’ and I said if you would have picked that baby up and tried to walk out of that door with him he would have opened fire on both of you and neither of you would be here right now,” said Ogle.\n\nOgle says it’s a miracle Jaxson is alive. She says he’s had two surgeries so far, and doctors expect him to pull through.\n\n“He heard Allie’s voice yesterday and opened his eyes. He wiggles his toes. He grabs my finger,” said Ogle. She’s been by their side in the hospital ever since this happened.\n\nPolice say after Jaxson was rescued by tactical teams and taken to the hospital, Marchetti refused to come out, and there was a standoff for hours.\n\nThen, a fire started and destroyed the home. Ogle says Allie’s childhood home burned down, too. “He wanted to make her relive her trauma and that’s exactly what he did,” she said.\n\nOn Saturday, investigators say they found Marchetti’s remains in the rubble. They believe he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\n“There’s a huge part of her that wishes they could have had the family that she wanted to have,” said Ogle.\n\nA GoFundMe has been set up to help them rebuild their lives and recover during this time.

        "content": "HOUSTON (AP) — As the Houston area works to clean up and restore power to hundreds of thousands after deadly storms left at least seven people dead, it will do so amid a smog warning and scorching temperatures that could pose health risks.\n\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Marc Chenard said on Saturday that highs of around 90 degrees (32.2 C) were expected through the start of the coming week, with heat indexes likely approaching 100 degrees (38 C) by midweek.\n\n“We expect the impact of the heat to gradually increase ... we will start to see that heat risk increase Tuesday into Wednesday through Friday,” Chenard said.\n\nThe heat index is what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with the air temperature, according to the weather service.\n\n“Don’t overdo yourself during the cleanup process,” the weather service’s Houston office said in a post on the social platform X.\n\nAt least four people were killed in the storms. (CNN, SIKHSTORMS, X, KTRK, KHOU, KPRC, MARY ELLEN ANGEL, @WESWAITKUS14, X, SikhStorms / X, @weswaitkus14/X)\n\nIn addition to the heat, the Houston area could face poor air quality during the weekend.\n\nHeavy rainfall was possible in eastern Louisiana and central Alabama on Saturday, and parts of Louisiana were also at risk for flooding.\n\nThe Houston Health Department said it would distribute 400 free portable air conditioners to area seniors, people with disabilities and caregivers of disabled children to contend with the heat.\n\nFive cooling centers also were opened — four in Houston and one in Kingwood.\n\nHUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS REMAIN WITHOUT POWER\n\nThe widespread destruction of Thursday’s storms brought much of Houston to a standstill. Thunderstorms and hurricane-force winds tore through the city — decimating the facade of one brick building and leaving trees, debris and shattered glass on the streets. A tornado also touched down near the northwest Houston suburb of Cypress.\n\nMore than a half-million homes and businesses in Texas remained without electricity by midday Saturday, according to PowerOutage.us. Another 21,000 customers were also without power in Louisiana, where strong winds and a suspected tornado hit.\n\n“It’s been a madhouse out here,” Cypress resident Hallie O’Bannon said. “You know we don’t have any power. No hot water. It’s been really crazy.”\n\n“Everyone is pretty resilient, and everyone’s just trying to get back to normal and help each other out and the best way we can,” O’Bannon added.\n\nA man uses a chainsaw to cut up a tree that tore off the facade of a house, Friday, May 17, 2024, in Houston, after a strong thunderstorm moved through Thursday evening. (Karen Warren/Houston Chronicle via AP)(AP)\n\nCenterPoint Energy, which has deployed 1,000 employees to the area and is requesting 5,000 more, said power restoration could take several days or longer in some areas, and that customers need to ensure their homes can safely be reconnected.\n\n“In addition to damaging CenterPoint Energy’s electric infrastructure and equipment, severe weather may have caused damage to customer-owned equipment” such as the weatherhead, which is where power enters the home, the company said.\n\nCustomers must have repairs completed by a qualified electrician before service can be restored, CenterPoint added.\n\nHigh-voltage transmission towers that were torn apart and downed power lines pose a twofold challenge for utility companies because the damage affected transmission and distribution systems, according to Alexandria von Meier, a power and energy expert who called that a rare thing. Damage to just the distribution system is more typical, von Meier said.\n\nHow quickly repairs are made will depend on a variety of factors, including the time it takes to assess the damage, equipment replacement, roadwork access issues and workforce availability.\n\nSevere thunderstorms have hit southeastern Texas for the second time this month. (MARTISE COLEMAN)\nSTORM CAUGHT MANY OFF GUARD\n\nHarris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez reported late Friday that three people died during the storm, including an 85-year-old woman whose home caught fire after being struck by lightning and a 60-year-old man who had tried to use his vehicle to power his oxygen tank.\n\nHouston Mayor John Whitmire previously said at least four other people were killed in the city when the storms swept through Harris County, which includes Houston.\n\nSchool districts in the Houston area canceled classes Friday for more than 400,000 students and government offices were closed.\n\nHouston Independent School District Superintendent Mike Miles said Saturday that he hoped to reopen schools on Monday, but that is dependent upon the restoration of electricity in school buildings.\n\n“If a school doesn’t have power, it will remain closed,” Miles told reporters during a tour of the heavily damaged Sinclair Elementary School.\n\nWhitmire warned that police were out in force, including state troopers sent to the area to prevent looting. He said the speed and intensity of the storm caught many off guard.\n\nNoelle Delgado, executive director of Houston Pets Alive, said she pulled up at the animal rescue on Thursday night and found the dogs and cats — more than 30 in all — uninjured, but the building’s awning had been ripped off, the sign was mangled and water was leaking inside.\n\nShe hoped to find foster homes for the animals.\n\n“I could definitely tell that this storm was a little different,” she said. “It felt terrifying.”\n\nSTATE AND FEDERAL RECOVERY ASSISTANCE ON THE WAY\n\nIn light of the storm damage, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo and Whitmire both signed disaster declarations, paving the way for state and federal storm recovery assistance.\n\nA separate disaster declaration from President Joe Biden makes federal funding available to people in seven Texas counties — including Harris — that have been affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes and flooding since April 26.\n\n___\n\nMiller reported from Oklahoma City; Associated Press reporters Jamie Stengle in Dallas, Valerie Gonzalez in McAllen, Texas, and Lisa Baumann in Bellingham, Washington, contributed.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "content": "(Stacker) - Do you want the bad news or the worst news first? Way.com is not cruel and will gently let you know the truth.\n\nOkay, the bad news first. The price of everything from groceries to furniture is going up. The worst news? Insuring your car to navigate this economic apocalypse just got significantly more expensive.\n\nFull Coverage or Empty Wallet? 2024 Auto Insurance Increases Will Hit You Hard!\n\nFull coverage costs $212 a month on average, while liability-only coverage costs $103 a month. That prices out to $2541 and $1238 a year, respectively. In 2023, the average price of full-coverage car insurance across the country went up by 24%.\n\nThe cost of car insurance depends on many things. These include the type of vehicle you drive, your driving record, and, in many places, your credit score.\n\nThe place where you live also has a big impact on your rate, especially in states like Michigan, Connecticut, and Florida. But rates for all types of car insurance are going up at an alarming rate. This is mostly because of things like the cost of auto parts and the effects of climate change.\n\nAuto Insurance Premiums Have Been on a Joyride to Hell\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, auto insurance premiums in 2024 have increased by a whopping 20.6% year-over-year. That’s right, your car insurance is now more expensive than that regrettable avocado toast you splurged on last week.\n\nThis was the biggest increase since December 1976, when rates went up 22.4% from the previous year.\n\nAccording to the BLS, the cost of car insurance went up 17.4% each year in 2023. This was the biggest annual increase since 1976, when it went up 28.7%.\n\nA rise in accidents, type of accidents, and location – factors all working together to make costs go up – are combining to give many American drivers insurance sticker shock.\n\nA lot of people stayed home during the height of the pandemic, but the number of deaths on the roads rose by 10.5% in 2021, reaching their highest level since 2005. The NHTSA said it was the biggest rise in deaths it had ever seen. The number of deaths didn’t go down much from 2021 to 2022.\n\nWay.com\n\nTop 10 States Where Rates are the Highest\n\nFrom population density to car thefts, take a look at the reasons why rates are the highest in these states.\n\nHow Long Will These Rates Stick Around?\n\nIf you are living in one of the states above, you can compare and see how much auto insurance premiums increased in 2023.\n\nCalmer Seas Ahead: Auto Insurance Rates Stabilizing\n\nAfter a turbulent year, auto insurance premiums are now stabilizing, with less substantial increases anticipated in the coming months.\n\nInsurers endured high loss ratios for the majority of 2023, which will likely be reflected in additional rate hikes. This is primarily attributable to the soaring cost of auto parts and the growing volume and severity of claims.\n\nThe insurance industry persisted under the strain of inflationary pressures, labor shortages, and supply chain deceleration, which originated during the COVID-19 pandemic into 2023. However, losses for personal auto insurers have decelerated as the impact of rate increases begins to outweigh loss trends. As a result, drivers may anticipate a degree of industry stabilization in the latter part of 2024.\n\nIncreasing Maintenance and Repair Costs = Lower Insurer Profits\n\nSince 2022, the consumer price index for car maintenance and repair from the Bureau of Labor Statistics has experienced significant double-digit increases. Higher expenses incurred at the auto shop are transferred to insurers, who then adjust their rates to accommodate the rising costs of claims.\n\nInsurers are also bearing the costs of increasingly frequent and severe accidents. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there was a significant increase in traffic fatalities during the COVID-19 shutdowns. In 2020, the number of fatalities rose by 7.3%, and in 2021, it increased by 10.1%.\n\nWith the rise of advanced automotive technology, the cost and complexity of car repairs have also increased. The cost of replacing a windshield can be quite high, especially in vehicles equipped with advanced features like rain-sensing wipers, driver assistance systems, and adaptive cruise control. The cost of replacing a windshield on older vehicles typically ranges from $300 to $600.\n\nElectric vehicles (EVs) do have higher repair costs. In certain models, Tesla has ingeniously integrated batteries as a structural component of their cars rather than a mere replaceable part. This strategic move has allowed Tesla, the leading manufacturer of electric vehicles in the U.S., to solidify its position in the market. If a minor accident occurs, it may be necessary to replace the entire battery, which can result in a significant expense ranging from $5,000 to $20,000 for the replacement part.\n\nTesla: Crash Proof Cars or Crash Test Dummy Insurance?\n\nIn a January 2023 investor call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled his intentions to revamp the design and reduce the expenses associated with repairing a Tesla after a collision. In 2019, the company also introduced Tesla Insurance, providing customers with the opportunity to secure more affordable rates compared to conventional insurance providers.\n\nNevertheless, numerous Tesla Insurance policyholders have expressed frustration over extended wait times for compensation. The automaker is also dealing with class-action lawsuits that claim Tesla sensors generate inaccurate collision warnings, leading to higher insurance premiums.\n\nPandemic Souvenir – Expensive Cars That Nobody Can Afford\n\nThe auto manufacturing industry is facing significant challenges due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, there is a decline in inventory and a noticeable increase in prices for new vehicles. According to Kelley Blue Book, the average transaction price for new cars has increased by about 23% since November 2020, now reaching over $48,000.\n\nOn the other hand, the prices of new vehicles have remained steady from one year to the next, thanks to the favorable market conditions for car buyers. Used vehicle prices also experienced a significant increase but have since decreased by 3% since October 2023, with an average list price of $26,533, according to KBB data. However, the inventory of used vehicles, particularly the ones that are most affordable, continues to be limited.\n\nFire, Flood, Fury – Climate Change Makes Insurance Companies Weep\n\nWeather events are increasingly impacting insurer losses. During the first half of 2023, the U.S. experienced significant losses due to severe convective storms, resulting in insured damages amounting to a minimum of $29 billion].\n\nIn 2023, there were insurance industry crises in several states that are particularly vulnerable to climate catastrophes, such as Florida, California, and Louisiana. In 2023, the United States witnessed a total of 25 weather or climate disaster events that resulted in losses surpassing $1 billion each, as per the latest data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as of Dec. 8.\n\nDue to the expensive claims related to climate change, major insurers are reducing coverage, not renewing policies, and stopping the sale of new homes and auto policies in high-risk areas. With the rise in the frequency of severe weather events, policyholders may experience a decrease in coverage options, potentially leading to higher rates.\n\nA Roadmap (Maybe)\n\nA significant majority of drivers experienced multiple premium increases in 2023, resulting in a substantial rise in the average annual rate for full coverage to $2,019. Several factors came together to cause a significant increase in rates, such as escalating repair costs, shortages in labor, higher prices for vehicles, and climate disasters.\n\nIn the future, car insurance pricing may be influenced by severe weather events and the expensive repairs associated with high-tech and electric vehicles.\n\nIt is projected that car insurance rates will experience a further increase in 2024. If you’re looking to reduce your car insurance expenses in 2024, there are several choices available. These include raising your deductibles, lowering your coverage limits, and obtaining quotes from multiple insurers to secure a more favorable rate.\n\nPolicyholders may inquire with their insurance companies to see if they are eligible for any potential discounts. Typical discounts encompass savings for vehicle safety features, defensive driving courses, combining home and auto insurance, and establishing automatic payments.\n\nBottom line\n\nAs a result of record losses incurred by insurers due to the escalating cost of repairs, climate calamities, and severe car accidents, auto insurance premiums increased by an alarming 24% in 2023.\nRecent estimates indicate that auto insurance premiums will increase by 7% in 2024, which is nearly double the median annual increase.\nAnnually, a full-coverage policy costs an average of $2,019 at the national level, which is equivalent to 2.6% of the median household income. The national average cost of state-mandated liability insurance increased to $1,154.\nIn 2023, average wage growth was 638% lower than the increase in auto insurance premiums.\nIncreasing deductibles and decreasing coverage limits are the most common cost-cutting measures among motorists. 45%, however, stated that they had not implemented any measures to decrease their premiums.\nThe average annual premium for a full-coverage policy for New York motorists is $3,374, the highest in the nation.\n\nThis story was produced by Way.com and reviewed and distributed by Stacker Media.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

Kevin Payne, a Republican from Peoria, said getting it to the governor’s desk has been a long time coming, especially since they tried to get it passed last year.\n\nDuring that time, it was never put on the Senate’s agenda.\n\n“I feel good about it. I think it’s a very reasonable bill,” said Payne.\n\nWith the bill so close to becoming law, he’s hoping there’s no “fowl play” from Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat.\n\n“I hope she’ll sign it.

        "content": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — A domestic violence suspect is accused of hitting and killing a bicyclist as he was fleeing from law enforcement in Phoenix on Thursday evening.\n\nAround 8 p.m., officers were called to a home near 16th Street and Southern Avenue for reports of a domestic violence incident. As officers arrived, 33-year-old Jamarr Young was “immediately aggressive toward officers” and began telling officers to shoot and kill him, police say.\n\nYoung reportedly refused to listen to the officers’ commands as they used less-lethal tools to get him to comply. However, he then got into his car, drove it toward the officers and hit a police SUV before speeding off.\n\nAs Young was heading northbound on 16th Street, police say he struck a bicyclist that was crossing the road. However, he didn’t stop and continued to speed away. Emergency crews attempted to save the bicyclist, but he died at the scene.\n\nCourt documents say at the time Young hit the bicyclist, he was speeding at 58 miles per hour in a 40 zone. While driving, Young also had a BAC of 0.138, nearly double the legal limit.\n\nHe was booked on 11 charges, including murder, leaving the scene of an accident with injuries, aggravated DUI and multiple counts of aggravated assault on a police officer.(Maricopa County Sheriff's Office)\n\nOfficers tracked Young’s vehicle and attempted to pull him over, but he refused, leading to a pursuit between him and officers. Authorities say police were forced to call off the pursuit when Young’s driving became “too erratic.”\n\nHe continued to speed off before crashing into a construction fence area in Tempe, near the I-10 and US 60 interchange.\n\nAfter crashing his car, Young attempted to run away from the police and tried to climb a chainlink fence but was eventually caught. Court documents say a struggle ensued between Young and officers as he put one officer in a headlock while another tackled him. During the fight, Young reportedly began punching the officers and kicking their faces and chests.\n\nOfficers were able to get Young into custody. and he was hospitalized with minor injuries. One officer broke his hand during the fight, and another had multiple cuts and bruises.\n\nIn an interview with police, the victim involved in the domestic violence incident said Young previously assaulted her in Flagstaff on May 1. A week after that assault, she left Flagstaff and went to stay with her sister at the Phoenix home. On the day of the incident, Young showed up “out of nowhere” and began banging on the doors and windows,” court documents state.\n\nOne of the women yelled at Young to leave, but he slapped her and dumped a bottle of alcohol on her, which is when authorities were called, according to investigators. Authorities say the victim and Young were in a previous relationship.\n\nYoung was booked on 11 charges, including murder, leaving the scene of an accident with injuries, aggravated DUI and multiple counts of aggravated assault on a police officer. Young was also charged with assault in connection to the original domestic violence call.\n\nThe bicyclist’s name has not been released. The investigation is ongoing.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story? Please click here to report it.\n\nDo you have a photo or video of a breaking news story?

        "content": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — Opioid drugs are a big topic among lawmakers across the country.\n\nThis week, Sonoran Prevention Works handed out their one-millionth dose of naloxone to people in Arizona.\n\nThe drug, also known as Narcan, is used to save people who stopped breathing during an overdose of an opioid.\n\nWhile it’s a milestone that shows people in our state are getting help during a crisis situation, it also shows the problems so many are still faced with.\n\nHaley Coles is the Executive Director of Sonoran Prevention Works. She says they’ve been tracking the doses they’ve given out to people since 2017.\n\n“We are continuing to get naloxone into people’s hands,” Coles said. “We have received reports of nearly 30,000 lives saved as a result of the naloxone we have given out. It’s enormous. It’s 30,000 people, 30,000 families 30,000 communities that have not been destroyed by the preventable loss of somebody.”\n\nThe need for the life-saving vial of naloxone has grown over the years.\n\nSPW says this milestone is bittersweet. Coles says while the drug they give out saves people, the need for it shows a prevention failure.\n\n“We’d love to live in a world where naloxone isn’t needed and people aren’t experiencing overdoses in the first place.”\n\nColes admits we may never live in a drug-free world, but we can do better. She believes better policy and education can make a big difference.\n\nShe says Arizona’s overdosing fatality numbers haven’t increased since 2021 like other states, but there are still better ways to prevent someone from stopping breathing because of an overdose.\n\n“It’s going to take everybody. It’s going to take prevention, treatment, recovery, public health everyone to make an impact because it’s not just one solution.”\n\nSPW has events where they give out kits of naloxone. They also will mail it to people free of charge.\n\nColes says the best people to give it to are people who are at risk of an overdose and then family, friends or people who live with that person.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more and getting naloxone for yourself, click here.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

        "content": "HOUSTON (AP) — Power outages could last weeks in parts of Houston, an official warned Friday, after thunderstorms with hurricane-force winds tore through the city, knocking out electricity to nearly 1 million homes and businesses in the region, blowing out windows on downtown high rises and flipping vehicles.\n\nThe National Weather Service said it confirmed a tornado with peak winds of 110 mph (177 kph) touched down near the northwest Houston suburb of Cypress in Harris County.\n\nHarris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, the county’s top elected official, said crews were still trying to determine the extent of the damage and the number of casualties from Thursday’s storms. Houston Mayor John Whitmire said four people, and possibly five, had died.\n\n“It was fierce. It was intense. It was quick, and most Houstonians didn’t have time to place themselves out of harms way,” Whitmire said at a news conference.\n\nWith multiple transmission towers down, Hidalgo urged patience. Thousands of utility workers were headed to the area, where power had already been restored to roughly 200,000 customers. Another 100,000 customers were without power in Louisiana, down from a peak of 215,000.\n\nSevere thunderstorms have hit southeastern Texas for the second time this month. (MARTISE COLEMAN)\n\n“We are going to have to talk about this disaster in weeks, not days,” Hidalgo said.\n\nShe said she had heard “horror stories of just terror and powerlessness” as the storm came through. The weather service also reported straight-line winds of up to 100 mph (161 kph) in downtown Houston and the suburbs of Baytown and Galena Park.\n\nNoelle Delgado’s heart sank as she pulled up Thursday night to Houston Pets Alive, the animal rescue organization where she is executive director. The dogs and cats — more than 30 in all — were uninjured, but the awning had been ripped off, the sign was mangled and water was leaking inside. With power expected to be out for some time and temperatures forecast to climb into the 90s Saturday, she hoped to find foster homes for the animals.\n\n“I could definitely tell that this storm was a little different,” she said. “It felt terrifying.”\n\nYesenia Guzmán, 52, worried whether she would get paid with the power still out at the restaurant where she works in the Houston suburb of Katy.\n\n“We don’t really know what’s going to happen,” she said.\n\nThe widespread destruction brought much of Houston to a standstill. Trees, debris and shattered glass littered the streets. One building’s wall was ripped off.\n\nSchool districts in the Houston area canceled classes for more than 400,000 students and government offices were closed. City officials urged people avoid downtown and stay off roads, many of which were flooded or lined with downed power lines and malfunctioning traffic lights.\n\nWhitmire said at least 2,500 traffic lights were out. He also warned would-be looters that “police are out in force, including 50 state troopers sent to the area to prevent looting.”\n\nAt least two of the deaths were caused by falling trees and another happened when a crane blew over in strong winds, officials said.\n\nWhitmire’s office posted a photo Friday on the social platform X showing the mayor signing a disaster declaration, which paves the way for state and federal storm recovery assistance.\n\nPresident Joe Biden later issued a disaster declaration for seven counties in Texas, including Harris, due to severe weather since April 26. His action makes federal funding available to people affected by the storms.\n\nThe problems from Thursday’s storms extended to the Houston suburbs, with emergency officials in neighboring Montgomery County describing the damage to transmission lines as “catastrophic.”\n\nHigh-voltage transmission towers that were torn apart and downed power lines pose a twofold challenge for the utility company because the damage affected transmission and distribution systems, according to Alexandria von Meier, a power and energy expert who called that a rare thing.\n\n“It’s more typical that the damage is just at the distribution system, which is, you know, just not as strong,” von Meier said, referring to power lines that tend to be more susceptible to wind damage.\n\nHow quickly repairs are made will depend on a variety of factors, including the time it takes to assess the damage, equipment replacement, roadwork access issues and workforce availability. Centerpoint Energy deployed 1,000 employees on Friday and had a pending request for 5,000 more line workers and vegetation professionals.\n\nOne silver lining, von Meier said, is that the damage was localized, unlike what happened in the 2021 statewide freeze, which could allow for other jurisdictions to send resources more readily. Although customers might want an aggressive repair timeline, she cautioned that it must proceed carefully and methodically.\n\n“Because if you try to fix this kind of thing in a hurry and you try to restore power in a hurry, you might injure people. You would be putting the workers at risk. You could be putting other people at risk. You could be blowing up equipment that then is going to take longer to replace,” von Meier said.\n\nThe storms also weren’t over Friday. Gulf Coast states could experience scattered, severe thunderstorms with tornadoes, large hail and damaging winds. Heavy to excessive rainfall is possible for eastern Louisiana into central Alabama, the National Weather Service said. Flood watches and warnings remained Friday for Houston and areas to the east.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center’s website showed a report of a tornado in Convent, Louisiana, about 55 miles (89 kilometers) from New Orleans, with multiple reports of trees and power poles down.\n\nA suspected tornado hit the Romeville area of St. James Parish on Thursday night with some homes impacted and trees down, but no injuries or fatalities had been reported, parish officials said in a social media post on Friday morning.\n\nThere were wind gusts of 84 mph (135 kph) at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport and 82 mph (132 kph) at New Orleans Lakefront Airport, according to Tim Erickson, a meteorologist at the weather service’s office for New Orleans and Baton Rouge.\n\nThe office for New Orleans and Baton Rouge issued a flash flood warning through Saturday.\n\nHeavy storms slammed the Houston area during the first week of May, leading to numerous high-water rescues, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes.\n\n___\n\nThe story has been updated to correct that school districts across the Houston area canceled classes Friday, not just the Houston Independent School District, and also the spelling of Cypress.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Jamie Stengle in Dallas and Valerie Gonzalez in McAllen contributed.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "content": "PHOENIX, AZ (AZFamily) ― Memorial Day is around the corner, and the experts at Consumer Reports have gear, gadgets and tips to prepare you for barbecue season’s opening day!\n\nBefore you cook on your gas grill for the first time this season, give it a thorough, once-over deep-clean and look for any parts that need to be replaced.\n\nIf it’s time for a new grill, Consumer Reports testers have evaluated grills all year and can help you choose.\n\nFor gas grills, testers look at pre-heat performance, how evenly the grates heat up, whether the grill can cook over indirect heat and how broad the grill’s temperature range is. Testers also look at the convenience and sturdiness of every grill.\n\nCR also surveys its members on their experience with different grills. Weber grills consistently earn high marks for owner satisfaction and reliability. And the top-performing midsized Weber Genesis Smart Grill EPX-335 35810001 for $1,400 is no exception.\n\nHowever, CR’s tests have also found that you don’t need to spend thousands to get a great-performing grill. While not as sturdy as the Weber, the Monument Grills 25392 for $420 performs just as well for hundreds less.\n\nTo keep your grill running at peak performance, you need to keep it clean. CR tried out different grill brushes to see which ones cleaned up the mess, such as stuck-on chicken skins, salmon skins and melted cheese — foods that typically stick to grill grates.\n\nThe metal Grill Daddy Steam Cleaning Grill Brush, which costs $100, made light work of our messes; however, it’s pricey. The Room Essentials Nylon Grill Cleaning Brush is an alternative, costing $10. A Nylon bristle brush also gets the job done, but you’ll need to replace it more often because Nylon can melt on hot grill grates.\n\nTo keep foods from sticking to the grates, preheat your grill for about 15 minutes before cooking.\n\nCR says to always wipe down your grill grates after using a metal bristle brush because the bristles can break off and end up in your food. A damp cloth will do. Use an oiled cloth if you have a grill with bare cast-iron grates.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

        "content": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — Domestic violence is a pattern of behavior when one person uses force, power or other forms of abuse to control another person. Unfortunately, Arizona has one of the highest rates of domestic violence in the country.\n\nAccording to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence in Arizona, 42.6% of women and 33.4% of men in the state experience some form of domestic violence or stalking from their intimate partner.\n\nThe Maricopa County Attorney’s Office says that 20 people per minute are physically abused by their intimate partner in the U.S., which is around 10 million victims per year. The disturbing statistics also show that one in three women and one in 20 men are killed by their intimate partner.\n\nJust this week, the Valley has seen several tragic domestic violence cases.\n\nOn Friday, a woman was held hostage by her baby’s father in a home in Surprise. She escaped with minor injuries, but her baby was shot multiple times and is in the hospital. The house was then engulfed in flames, and police don’t know the suspect’s current condition.\n\nEarlier this week, 28-year-old Brooke Lundy was killed by her boyfriend, Matthew Blevins, before he shot himself in Gilbert. Lundy’s family says her boyfriend was controlling and abusive. He reportedly put cameras in the home and threatened to kill her and her family if she left.\n\nDomestic violence can be hard to identify as it can take many forms of physical, emotional and financial abuse, and all cases and situations are different.\n\nThere are organizations available to help anyone going through a domestic violence situation in Arizona.\n\nSee the list below for information on the domestic violence programs and shelters available in Maricopa County.\n\nValleywide:\n\nMaricopa County Domestic Violence Hotline: 480-890-3039 or 1-844-723-3387 (SAFEDVS).\nA New Leaf: 480-969-4024\n\nPhoenix:\n\nChrysalis: 602-944-4999\nCPLC De Colores: 602-269-1515\nSojourner Center: 602-244-0089\n\nWest Valley:\n\nGoodyear: New Life Center, 623-932-4404\nPeoria: Eve’s Place, 623-537-5380\n\nEast Valley:\n\nScottsdale: Scottsdale Family Advocacy Center, 480-312-6300\nChandler: Catholic Charities My Sister’s Place, 480-821-1024\nApache Junction: Community Alliance Against Family Abuse, 480-982-0196\n\nThe National Domestic Violence Hotline is also available 24-7 for anyone who needs help at 1-800-799-7233 (SAFE).\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

        "content": "PHOENIX (AP) — Attorney John Eastman pleaded not guilty on Friday to conspiracy, fraud and forgery charges for his role in the effort to overturn Donald Trump’s loss in Arizona to Joe Biden in the 2020 election.\n\nEastman, who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election, is the first person charged in Arizona’s fake elector case to be arraigned.\n\nArraignments are scheduled May 21 for 12 other people charged in the case, including nine of the 11 Republicans who had submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring Trump had won Arizona.\n\nThe Arizona indictment said Eastman encouraged the GOP electors to cast their votes in December 2020, unsuccessfully pressured state lawmakers to change the election’s outcome in Arizona and told then-Vice President Mike Pence that he could reject Democratic electors in the counting of electoral votes in Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nEastman, who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election, is the first person charged in Arizona’s fake elector case to be arraigned.(Getty Images)\n\nTrump himself was not charged in the Arizona case but was referred to as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nCharges have not yet been made public against Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and Trump-aligned attorney, but he was readily identifiable based on descriptions of the defendants in the indictment. No arraignment date has been scheduled for Giuliani. Arizona authorities say they have been unable to serve Giuliani with the notice of the charges.\n\nFormer Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows is scheduled to be arraigned on June 7.\n\nLast year, Eastman was indicted on racketeering, conspiracy and other charges in a scheme to overturn the 2020 president election in Georgia. He has pleaded not guilty to the Georgia charges. Eastman also is named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the sprawling federal indictment filed in Washington against Trump for working to overturn the results of the 2020 election in the run-up to the violent riot by his supporters at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nArizona is the fourth state where allies of the former president have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election.\n\nThe 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona’s Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were “duly elected and qualified” electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.\n\nBiden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes.\n\nOf the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden’s victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 fake Arizona electors, who had asked a federal judge to de-certify the results and block the state of Arizona from sending results to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, the judge concluded the Republicans had “failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims.” Days after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 participated in the certificate signing.\n\nMultiple in-person attempts were made to serve Giuliani with the notice but a doorman at his New York City apartment wouldn’t accept it, said Richie Taylor, a spokesperson for Democratic Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, whose office is prosecuting the case. Taylor said efforts by the attorney general’s office to reach Giuliani by phone also were unsuccessful.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

        "content": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — Arizona’s Family is learning more about a young woman killed in a murder-suicide case in Gilbert earlier this week.\n\nFamily say 28-year-old Brooke Lundy grew up in Nebraska and moved out to Arizona for a fresh start a few years ago.\n\nLundy’s family say they just found out about reports her boyfriend had controlling and abusive behavior right before this happened.\n\nThey say they just learned he had cameras set up around the house to watch her at all times, and he threatened to kill her and her whole family if she left just two weeks ago.\n\n“We were very, very close,” said Lundy’s uncle, Joey Christensen.\n\nLundy’s loved ones are in a state of shock. Christensen and his mother-in-law Judy Rosenburg are speaking on behalf of the family.\n\n“They all feel helpless,” said Rosenburg.\n\nOn Sunday, just after midnight, officers found Lundy and her boyfriend, 40-year-old Matthew Blevins, dead inside a home near Val Vista Drive and Ray Road. Detectives believe Lundy was shot more than once before Blevins turned the gun on himself.\n\n“She had told her mother on her birthday, May 1, that he was threatening to kill her,” said Rosenburg.\n\nLundy grew up in Grand Island, Nebraska, and her life was full of tragedy. Rosenburg says Lundy’s father died by suicide when she was 12, and her mother wasn’t able to care for her.\n\nSo, Lundy and her brother moved in with their grandparents and Christensen. She lost both of her grandparents by the time she was 14.\n\n“So, Brooke was kind of alone and she left. She had a job offer in Arizona so that is how she came to go to Arizona about three-and-a-half, four years ago,” said Rosenburg.\n\nRosenburg says Lundy was a manager at a gas station, and that’s how she met Blevins.\n\n“From what she told me is he would come in and get gas and he asked her out and he was considerably older than her, but she thought he was a very nice guy at that point,” said Rosenburg.\n\nThe couple moved in together, and she told her family back in Nebraska that she was happy.\n\nRosenburg says they had no idea the relationship was abusive until Lundy revealed the truth just two weeks ago.\n\n“A couple weeks ago he broke her nose and her arm and he threatened to harm her whole family if she came back to Nebraska,” said Rosenburg.\n\nRosenburg says Lundy tried to get away but felt trapped. Her family was working on a plan to get her out of danger.\n\n“I just wish that I could have been down there to get her out of there and help her before this happened,” said Christensen.\n\nThe family set up a GoFundMe to go toward funeral expenses. They want others to know if you or anyone in your life is in a domestic violence situation, help is available.\n\nThe Domestic Violence Hotline 24/7 is also available at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or by texting “START” to 88788..\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

According to the Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office, evidence showed Sandra “vigorously struggled while she was in the grave” and she may have been conscious for up to five minutes.\n\nCellphone evidence showed Pagniano was in the gravesite area days before Sandra went missing and the night of the kidnapping.\n\nDetectives also found notes Sandra supposedly wrote to her husband, stating that she was leaving and giving him her vehicles, house and custody of their kids. However, these notes were actually written by Pagniano, authorities said.\n\nIn addition to the life sentence, Pagniano was given another 16.5 years in prison for kidnapping, forgery and fraud schemes.\n\n“I hope the life sentence brings some closure to the victim’s family. I want to be clear that my office will vigorously prosecute anyone who commits a violent crime in Yavapai County and we will continue to pursue the death penalty in appropriate cases,” McGrane said in a written statement.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

        "content": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — A new CDC report shows national drowning rates are on the rise for the first time in decades.\n\nAccording to the report, over 4,500 drowning deaths occurred each year from 2020-2022, and almost 40 million U.S. adults can’t swim.\n\nAccording to the CDC, drowning is the leading cause of death for children ages one to four. It’s the second leading cause of accidental death for children between five and 14. Data shows that nine out of 10 drowning deaths happen when a caregiver is supervising but not paying attention.\n\nAhead of summer vacation plans, the United States Swim School Association (USSSA) wants families to know how to keep their loved ones safe if their plans include a pool, beach or lake.\n\nUSSSA recommends having enough lifejackets for family and guests, ensuring lifejackets are U.S. Coast Guard approved, avoiding arm floaties, keeping toys away from the pool and having a designated ‘pool watcher’ to watch kids swimming, especially at parties.\n\nAside from the physical additions you can add to your pool, lake or beach activities, Executive Director Liza Zarda says the biggest line of defense from drowning is swim lessons.\n\n“It’s so tragic because when incidents happen. I hear from families, ‘I didn’t know, I didn’t know it can happen to me,’ and a child can slip under in a matter of seconds,” Zarda said. “Swim lessons reduce the risk of drowning by 88%, and many of them do have grant and scholarship programs.”\n\nIf you’re looking for swim lessons near you, Zarda says to check out your city’s parks and recreation programs for classes.\n\nYou can also find certified swim schools near you at this link.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

New Mexico State Police Lt. Phil Vargas said some rail cars caught fire and burned for hours after the derailment.\n\nInitial passersby posted video and photos on social media of crumpled train cars and billowing, black smoke.\n\nA fifth tank car carrying propane — a type of liquefied petroleum gas — was exposed to the flames and released vapor through its pressure relief device, investigators said.\n\nEach derailed tank car was carrying about 30,000 gallons of liquefied petroleum gas, according to investigators.\n\nThe derailment also led Amtrak to cancel some passenger travel, including on the route between Los Angeles and Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Fantastic, 18-year-old Aris Arredondo and two 16-year-olds were all arrested for the alleged crime.\n\nAuthorities say Arredondo instigated the fight by punching the victim in the mouth, and Fantastic began hitting the boy as he was on the ground.

Authorities say Fantastic body slammed the victim to the ground and stomped on his head.\n\nThe mother of one victim gave a victim testimony in court, asking for Fantastic to not be released. “This is not his first time being in trouble or his second time. It’s already been stated he has other cases that he’s dealing with already. We find that he is a safety threat to not only my kid, but the community as a whole as there has been multiple cases, not just the one from my son. Releasing him would just be a slap on the wrist. I feel like he needs to learn from his mistakes. Even being released with conditions, he’s not going to learn,” she said.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

May 2001.\n\nIt was a frantic search for eight-year-old Elizabeth Byrd, who disappeared while walking to her elementary school.\n\n“I think somebody grabbed her on the way to school,” her mother, Linda Stone, said with panic and tears at the time. “I want my daughter back so bad.”\n\nLinda’s intuition about her daughter’s fate was right.\n\nThe next day, the little girl’s body found in her school clothes, wrapped in carpeting and left in an irrigation ditch.\n\nA man named Steven Newell had dated one of Elizabeth’s sisters and showed up to her funeral, then the cemetery.\n\n“He stood in the background and that’s when the cops started looking at him. And then at the cemetery he stepped on the soft soil and that’s when they looked at his footprints from that,” Elizabeth’s sister, Denise Ross, said.\n\n“And it matched, right?” asked True Crime Arizona Reporter Briana Whitney.\n\n“Yeah,” Denise said.\n\nBetween matching footprints to the crime scene, an SRP worker who saw Newell in the irrigation ditch that day, and an interrogation confession to police that he strangled Elizabeth to death, Steven Newell was arrested for murder.\n\nHe was convicted and sentenced to death.\n\nIt was a nightmare come true for Linda Stone.\n\n“She was never the same again. Never,” said Denise.\n\nDenise said they’d often visit Elizabeth’s grave for comfort.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Linda passed away after complications from a stroke.\n\n“It was devastating to me, yeah,” Denise said with tears in her eyes. “We’ve always talked, and she wanted to be buried with my sister Elizabeth,” Denise said.\n\nDenise said she’s living on Social Security and struggling to make ends meet. She’s hoping the community will help donate so they can bury her mom next to her sister with a headstone.\n\n“It would be so joyful to make sure my mom’s last wishes are done, you know. Because that’s what I promised her I would do, and I’m trying my best to do it,” said Denise.\n\nSteven Newell still sits on death row awaiting execution.\n\nDenise said it’s now up to her to see her sister’s case through till the end.\n\n“I know my mom wanted to see the end of the death penalty case, and so, you know, now that I’m the oldest girl in the family I feel like I have to carry that on,” Denise said.\n\nLinda’s funeral will be held next week.\n\nYou can donate to help their family with burial expenses by visiting their GoFundMe page.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

        "content": "BOISE, Idaho (AP) — A typo in the triple murder indictment of an Idaho man accused of killing his wife and his girlfriend’s two children doesn’t mean that he should be acquitted of one of the deaths, a judge said Thursday.\n\nProsecutors had been carefully detailing the case against Chad Daybell to jurors over the past three weeks. Shortly after they closed their case Thursday afternoon, 7th District Judge Steven Boyce alerted the attorneys to a major error: The date of 7-year-old Joshua “JJ” Vallow’s death was wrong in the indictment.\n\nThat sparked a flurry of arguments over whether the problem could be fixed or if Daybell should simply be acquitted of that charge.\n\n“We’re all kind of falling on our sword here,” special assistant attorney general Ingrid Batey told the judge Thursday, describing the issue as “clearly a clerical error.”\n\nBoyce ultimately agreed with prosecutors, describing it as an “inadvertent mistake” and saying jurors could be given special instructions to allow them to consider the full case.\n\nThe bizarre case began in 2019 after the two children were reported missing, prompting a multi-state search and a missing persons investigation. The case turned stranger by the day, according to police reports, with people close to Daybell describing him as promoting doomsday-focused religious beliefs, including claims of reincarnation and that people could be possessed by evil spirits and turned into “zombies.”\n\nProsecutors ultimately charged Daybell with three counts of first-degree murder, insurance fraud and conspiracy to commit murder and grand theft in connection with the deaths of his late wife Tammy Daybell and of his newest wife’s two kids. The new wife, Lori Vallow Daybell, was also charged and sentenced to life in prison without parole after a trial last year.\n\nThe original indictment filed in the case back in 2021 had the correct date, saying that JJ’s death occurred on or between Sept. 22 and 23, 2019. But it was amended in February to say the boy was killed “on or between the 8th and 9th day of September, 2019.” Those are actually the dates that prosecutors believe his big sister, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan, was killed.\n\nThe amendment was made after prosecutors asked the judge for permission to make a few changes to the wording of the conspiracy charges. Critically, they did not ask for permission to change the murder count related to JJ’s death.\n\nBoyce said that meant they did not legally have permission to change that count, showing that the date change was accidental.\n\nDefense attorney John Prior argued that any changes now would substantially harm Chad Daybell’s due process rights, but Boyce noted that the dates had been correct for three years of the case, and the error was only introduced a few months before the trial began. That gave them ample time to prepare, the judge said.\n\nPrior will begin presenting Daybell’s defense case on Monday.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.",

That first day she only had 12 visitors.”\n\nNow, they give tours to over 300,000 people from across the world every year and can take 1,500 people on a tour daily.\n\n“It’s amazing to hear that they plan their vacations around specifically seeing lower Antelope Canyon and it’s impressive what we’ve built,” Young said.\n\nMore than 4 million people visit the area annually.\n\nYoung is now CEO and said all the tourism has helped the city of Page and surrounding communities grow.\n\n“I think in the last 10 years there’s been like 20 hotels that have popped up and these hotels are going up because of this slot canyon,” she said.\n\nThe Antelope Canyon tours also provide much-needed job opportunities for people on the Navajo Nation.\n\n“We have an employee that actually drives two hours every day just to get to work,” Young said. “I’m just like ‘oh my goodness’ and that’s how scarce jobs are out on the Navajo Nation. We here want to share a part of our culture. We want to share a part of the Navajo Nation and how beautiful the Navajo Nation can be.”\n\nThe 10 years were celebrated with a ribbon cutting and art unveiling.\n\nYoung said that for the next decade, they want to continue to give back to their community, create more business opportunities and grow as a family company.\n\n“I’m very proud of how far we’ve come. I’m very proud of how far we’ve come as a family. I’m proud of the things that we’ve been able to accomplish,” Young said.\n\nSummer is the busy season, and tours are full daily, so their suggestion is to try to book your trip a month in advance.

Dude, put the knife down. Steve, we’re just trying to figure out what happened,” said one officer.\n\nHe ignores them and keeps walking away. It’s at that point when one officer pulls his taser and fires it, but the suspect keeps walking away and heads down the canal.\n\nWhen he turns back into the neighborhood, police close in on him, and they try to hit him again with the taser. Seconds later, an officer fires his pistol, and the suspect is shot several times.\n\nPolice Chief Thomas Garrity said the suspect was going for a knife and said they recovered two bladed weapons at the scene.\n\n“As part of the investigation we do know there were 12 shots total fired,” said Garrity.\n\nWe talked to the 29-year-old suspect’s family, who said police fired too many shots.\n\nAn eyewitness who saw the whole thing go down stayed firm on her stance after watching the video released by police.\n\n“I still think he shouldn’t have been shot so many times. He had a kitchen knife in his hand, he didn’t have a gun,” said Marie Hernandez.\n\nWhen the police chief was asked if officers were fired excessively, he said the county attorney should decide.\n\n“My opinion now doesn’t matter, that’s up to the attorney and the investigation,” Garrity said. “I think the video shows for itself what the officers did.”\n\nThe chief said the suspect had previous run-ins with police, but they weren’t aware of his mental state at the time. However, others say that isn’t so.\n\nThe same reporting party who called 911 also reportedly told one of the officers at the scene that the suspect struggled with mental illness.\n\nThe six officers involved in the shooting are on modified duty pending a full investigation being handled by the Yuma County Attorney.\n\nThe suspect has not been charged. His family said he is out of the hospital and recovering in rehab.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

        "content": "GLENDALE, AZ (AZFamily) — According to the Military Child Education Coalition (MCEC), military families relocate every couple of years. This can make it tough for kids to make solid friendships and stay caught up with school so a program is being rolled out to help with that.\n\nOn Thursday, Gov. Katie Hobbs held a signing ceremony at the Luke Air Force Base for HB2264 to officially establish the Purple Star School Program in Arizona.\n\n“This is an exciting day for the over 15,000 active duty children in the state who deserve quality education and support, just like every other student,” said Gov. Hobbs. “Arizona is proudly home to seven military installations and over 20,000 active duty service members and their families.”\n\nThe program helps military-connected students transition smoothly to new schools. With the help of a military-family liaison at each school, students receive guidance on how to successfully navigate their new learning environment.\n\n“School should be a place for comfort for every Arizonan student, especially our military children. It should be a place for them to build that confidence, expand their knowledge and create friendships and memories that will last a lifetime,” said Gov. Hobbs.\n\nMichelle Hill, the principal at Dreaming Summit Elementary School, said military-connected children make up 20% of her student body.\n\nDreaming Summit, Luke Elementary School, Millennium High School and Trivium Preparatory Academy - Great Hearts are the four schools Gov. Hobbs said are currently part of the Purple Star School Pilot Program.\n\n“It’s such an easy process. I don’t know why you wouldn’t do it. It gives our students the ability to say ‘I am part of something bigger’ and that’s one thing that giving them those leadership skills early on is crucial,” said Hill.\n\nHill and other educators at the ceremonial signing said the program also helps students create long-lasting friendships.\n\n“Students, they want to fit it in. They want to feel welcomed and supported, and so it’s important that we have programs like these in place to make that happen for kids,” said Carissa Harvey, the assistant principal at Millennium High School in Goodyear.\n\nApplications will need to be submitted to the Arizona Department of Education to become a designated Purple Star School. The four basic requirements are that schools have a liaison for military families, dedicate a webpage with tools and resources for families, train staff on unique military needs and have a peer-to-peer program.\n\nA spokesperson with MCEC said 40 states, including Arizona, are now part of the Purple Star School Program. We’re told six other states are pending legislation to join.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

I can’t even put into words how happy I am to be his mother,” said Jett Weinstein’s mother, Candice Mishler.\n\nShe said his graduation ceremony from Mountain Ridge High School came just two days after he got his prosthetic leg.\n\n“Every day, he wakes up and he has this will and drive to keep pushing,” she said.\n\nAfter several surgeries and months of physical therapy working to regain his strength and balance, the 17-year-old did exactly what he set out to do: walk.\n\n“It feels great to be here,” Weinstein said. “Definitely a big accomplishment for sure, and also a huge accomplishment being able to walk.”\n\nIn February, he and a fellow classmate were headed back from Flagstaff when they crashed, causing a guardrail to go through the car. Weinstein had to get one of his legs amputated and has been wheelchair-bound for the past several months.\n\n“He just got his prosthetic Tuesday, so we are only two days in with his prosthetic and its been 24 hours a day, standing, walking, getting used to how the knee bends,” Mishler explained.\n\nWeinstein says getting to this milestone took a lot of perseverance.\n\n“A lot of physical therapy, training, the gym ... all of the above,” he said.\n\nThursday, he focused on his steps, barely noticing the standing ovation from his classmates.\n\n“Show everyone I’m OK almost,” he said. “I’m starting to walk, not fully walking, but I’m getting there.”\n\nHe said walking across the stage to get his diploma was not just for him, but also for his friend who passed away in the accident.\n\n“Doing it for him, walking for Jaxson,” he said.\n\nAs Weinstein walks toward the future, he hopes to also serve as an example.\n\n“Never backing down from your challenges; always fight them,” he said.\n\nWeinstein plans to work with his dad and pursue a career in music as a DJ.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

This is already the second one,” he said.\n\nThe Mesa man suffered his first heart attack in 2021 and another on March 10, 2024. The second time, he started to feel pain in his chest while he was on a bike ride with his friend, Stan. He blacked out on the Pima Canyon Trailhead at South Mountain.\n\n“Started to walk up here and couldn’t take it anymore. Sat the bike down, sat down here and that’s when they took over,” said Biren.\n\nDesirlee Lewis, a nurse at Banner Health who just happened to be starting her hike at the same time Biren collapsed, jumped into action and performed CPR alongside other hikers before paramedics with the Guadalupe Fire Department arrived.\n\n“He wasn’t breathing. He did not have a pulse. His color was purple, blue,” Lewis said.\n\nLewis surprised Biren in the hospital the next day.\n\n“Obviously very emotional,” said Biren.\n\n“The fact that Marc was alive and awake, but also has suffered no brain injury and no problems with his level of functioning, is just an absolute miracle,” said Lewis.\n\nThe pair became unlikely friends and even went to lunch with Biren’s wife.\n\n“It’s a traumatic experience, but it’s such a miraculous experience of healing on both ends. It was healing for Marc and for a way in myself, it was healing for me,” said Lewis.\n\nIt’s something no one there that day will ever forget.\n\n“We do respond to a lot of medical calls. We do respond to a lot of cardiac arrests, but given the outcome of this situation, it’s truly unique. It’s a miracle,” said Guadalupe Fire Department Captain George Fleming.\n\n“I’ll still get chills thinking about it because it’s just, I think it was more than just the right person, right place, right time as much as it was just, it was supposed to happen for all of us,” said Lewis.\n\n“Met a lot of really great people, a lot of angels,” said Biren.\n\nFor Biren, this experience has been a wake-up call. It has encouraged him to improve his diet, and he’s lost 20 pounds since this happened two months ago.\n\nBiren’s story has a happy ending, but that’s not always the case in situations like this.\n\nPhoenix Fire says there were 199 calls for rescue last year, and so far this year, there have been 94.

Court documents say a security guard searched his backpack and found a 9mm handgun with a loaded extended magazine and an additional loaded magazine.\n\nInvestigators said Coops hadn’t made a threat to school, students or staff, but he was immediately detained and arrested.\n\n18-year-old Joseph Coops(Arizona's Family)\n\nIn an interview with authorities, Coops said he purchased the gun from a person on social media last year. Court documents say he admitted to carrying the weapon with him nearly every day he went to school at Mesa High School.\n\nWhen asked why he purchased the gun, Coops said he “just wanted to have one,” not necessarily for personal protection, court paperwork states.\n\nCourt documents state Coops said he knew when he saw the metal detectors, staff would find his gun. He claimed he didn’t plan on hurting anyone, stating “there was no real reason other than wanting to have a firearm,” authorities said.\n\nCoops was booked on one count of possession of a deadly weapon, carrying a weapon on school grounds and carrying a deadly weapon under 21 years old.\n\nThe arrest comes one day after Mesa Public Schools announced it had finished implementing a weapons detection system at all of its high schools. The weapons detection system works like a metal detector and alerts school administrators to possible weapons on campus.\n\nThe school district says board members approved the weapons detection program at its November 28, 2023, meeting.\n\nMesa Public Schools released the following statement:\n\nOur statement is below: Mesa High School launched its weapons detection system yesterday (May 15) morning. The system located a firearm on a student attempting to go through the system to enter campus. While this student at no time threatened another student or staff member with a gun, they have been arrested and will be disciplined according to the Mesa Public Schools discipline procedures.\n\nSafety is a top priority at Mesa Public Schools. Weapons have no place in our schools. The weapons detection system is another layer to MPS security measures. Our goal is weapons detection will deter anyone from bringing weapons on our campuses.\n\nMesa Public Schools\n\nA similar program is being tested at two Phoenix Union High School District campuses.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

And of course, there’s a link to click to make your payment.\n\nBut none of it is real.\n\nIn fact, there are no toll roads at all anywhere in Arizona!\n\nState Attorney General Kris Mayes says it’s a type of scam that’s growing in our state.\n\n“Increasingly we’re seeing scams that claim to be from the government, ‘I’m from the government’ or ‘I’m from the IRS and you owe taxes,’ or ‘you just won the lottery and you owed but you need to pay us the taxes first before we’ll pay out the winnings of the lottery,’” she said.\n\nThe text claims to be from “Suns Pass Services” and you’ll notice there’s an “S” in the name. That’s important because it’s designed to look like Sun Pass Services, which is a legitimate prepaid toll program found in numerous states across the nation.\n\nThe text scam has even gotten the attention of the Federal Trade Commission and the FBI, which recently issued warnings not to be duped.\n\nThey say if you get one of these texts, use the “report junk” feature on your phone.\n\nYou can also report it to the FBI’s internet computer crime center at ic3.gov.\n\nOtherwise, they say, don’t engage with the scammers at all.\n\nJust delete it. “What they’re trying to do is play on your emotions, play on fear, and try to drive you to an immediate reaction and try to get you to go to your bank account and send them money,” Mayes said. “Don’t do it.”\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

Investigators say Garcia told the child that staff liked to bring 6-year-olds “to a different room to check out their teeth,” so he brought her to a different room and told her mother to stay with her younger sister.\n\nAuthorities say 27-year-old Deion Alexander Garcia, an X-ray tech with Kidiatric Dental and Orthodontics, is accused of inappropriately touching several children.(Maricopa County Sheriff's Office)\n\nOnce the child was in the separate room, Garcia told the girl to stand forward but began touching her inappropriately. He reportedly then took photographs of the exposed child.\n\nDuring the investigation, police discovered a similar allegation was filed in 2022 against Garcia at the dentist’s Chandler location. In this incident, the parents of a 6-year-old girl noticed she “acted a little differently” after her X-ray. The girl told her parents she “never wanted to go back there,” according to court documents. Later, the child told her parents that Garcia touched her inappropriately.\n\nAuthorities interviewed the second victim, who reported that Garcia molested her, court paperwork states. However, no DNA evidence linked Garcia to those allegations, and the investigation was closed due to lack of evidence.\n\nOn May 10, police arrested Garcia as he was walking out of Kidiatric Dental and Orthodontics’ Gilbert location near Warner and Lindsay roads. In an interview, Garcia denied touching the girl and taking photos of her. He reportedly claimed that the office was under video surveillance during the time of the alleged assault.\n\nHowever, detectives searched Garcia’s phone and found 10 photos of the first 6-year-old victim and an unknown 4-year-old child. Court documents say Garcia refused to give authorities his phone password, so police are working to determine if there’s more photo evidence or additional victims.\n\nGarcia was booked on 14 felony counts, including 10 counts of sexual exploitation of a minor and four counts of child molestation.\n\nMedia Release-\nChandler Police Arrest Pediatric Dental Assistant on Multiple Felony Charges Involving Children.#ChandlerPD #ChandlerAZ pic.twitter.com/Vi7EAI7sgx\n\n— Chandler Police (@ChandlerPolice) May 16, 2024\n\nArizona’s Family has contacted Kidiatric Dental and Orthodontics regarding Garcia’s arrest.\n\nIf you believe your child may have been a victim of these crimes, contact the Chandler Sex Crimes Unit at 480-782-4494.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

        "content": "CNN — US federal prosecutors on Thursday charged an Arizona woman with participating in an elaborate fraud scheme to help foreign IT workers pose as Americans, get hired by major US companies and earn $6.8 million in revenue that could benefit the nuclear-armed North Korean regime.\n\nThe scheme compromised the identities of 60 Americans and affected 300 US companies, including a major national TV network, a “premier” Silicon Valley tech company, and an “iconic” American car maker, says an indictment unsealed in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The indictment did not name of the companies.\n\nThe Arizona woman, Christina Chapman, is accused of running a “laptop farm” from her home, in which she logged into US company-issued laptops on behalf of the foreign IT workers to trick companies into believing the workers were living in the US. At least some of the workers are described as North Korean nationals in the indictment.\n\nThe court documents shed light on a broader phenomenon that US national officials have been trying to thwart for years: How thousands of North Korean overseas IT workers are trying to subvert sanctions and send untold amounts of money back to Pyongyang.\n\nChapman is charged with nine counts including conspiracy to defraud the US. She has been arrested and is expected to make her initial court appearance in Arizona on Thursday, a law enforcement official familiar with the matter told CNN. Court records did not identify a lawyer for Chapman.\n\n“The conspiracy perpetrated a staggering fraud on a multitude of industries, at the expense of generally unknowing U.S. companies and persons,” the indictment says.\n\nThe overseas IT workers also “attempted to gain employment and access to information at two different U.S. government agencies on three different occasions,” the indictment says, not naming the agencies. Those attempts were “discovered and thwarted,” prosecutors said.\n\nIn a separate criminal complaint unsealed Thursday, a Ukrainian man named Oleksandr Didenko was accused of operating at least three “laptop farms” comprised of 79 computers in San Diego; Jefferson City, Tennessee; and Virginia Beach, Virginia. Didenko ran a business that allowed clients, including overseas IT workers, to use false identities to get hired for remote work, prosecutors alleged. A person who gave their name as Christina Chapman was among the people that Didenko shipped a laptop to, according to the complaint.\n\nWhen the FBI used a warrant to search Chapman’s residence in October, agents found more than 90 computers, the complaint says. Three jobs filled by North Korean IT workers at US companies were tied through business records to the computers found in Chapmans’ residence, according to the complaint.\n\nDidenko is accused of aggravated identity theft and wire fraud among other charges. He is not yet in custody in the US, the law enforcement official told CNN.\n\nNorth Korean IT workers generally pose as other nationalities, offer to work remotely and apply for jobs in gaming, IT support, and artificial intelligence, among other sectors, according to a 2022 public warning from the State Department and other agencies.\n\nFBI agents and State and Treasury officials have been quietly trying to raise awareness of the North Korean insider threat by conducting briefings for business executives and chasing down leads about potential North Korean IT workers at US companies.\n\nSome of these IT workers work closely with North Korean hackers, who are also a rich source of revenue for the regime, according to experts. About half of North Korea’s missile program has been funded by cyberattacks and cryptocurrency theft, a White House official said last year.\n\n“By directing its IT workers to gain employment at Western companies, North Korea has weaponized its tech talent and created the ultimate insider threat,” Michael Barnhart, a North Korea specialist at Google-owned cybersecurity firm Mandiant, told CNN.\n\n“These operatives bypass sanctions by diverting their paychecks to help fund North Korea’s nuclear program. Simultaneously, they’re providing a foothold into major organizations for North Korea’s more advanced threat groups,” Barnhart said.\n\nA previous CNN investigation found that the founder of a California-based cryptocurrency startup had unwittingly paid tens of thousands of dollars to a North Korean engineer. The entrepreneur was unaware of the situation until the FBI notified him, he said.\n\nAnd North Korean illustrators and graphic designers appear to have helped produce work for US animation studios unbeknownst to those companies, independent researchers told CNN last month. The researchers discovered a trove of cartoon sketches on an open computer server on the North Korean portion of the internet.\n\nThe State Department on Thursday offered $5 million in rewards for “information that leads to the disruption” of North Korean money laundering or other financial fraud.\n\nThe State Department rarely reveals details of the fruits of its “Rewards for Justice” program, which the department says has paid about $250 million to some 125 people worldwide over the last 40 years for tips that helped apprehend terrorists and counter national security threats. But the department did say on Thursday that it had paid $5 million each to two unnamed people whose information “helped disrupt an illicit financial scheme that benefited” North Korea.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

        "content": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — Lawmakers are making a new push to protect children from water beads. Esther’s Law, recently introduced in the Senate, would ban the sale of water beads in products meant for kids.\n\n“Unfortunately, water beads send thousands of children to the emergency room every year,” said Gabe Knight, a safety policy analyst with Consumer Reports. At least one death has also been blamed on water beads, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n\nWater beads are small polymers that expand when wet, sometimes up to 100 times their original size. They are a choking hazard and can cause a variety of injuries, including infections and bowel obstructions.\n\n“They look like candy. They look like something enticing and edible to a young child,” Knight said. “Parents can take various precautions to keep them away from young children, but because they are so small, they can easily roll away, scatter, become hidden between floor boards, under furniture, in rugs and be found even months later by a young child for whom they were not purchased.”\n\nThat’s what McKaylee Brown says happened to her son, Jonah. He was just nine months old when he got sick. “He was just projectile vomiting in a way I’ve never seen,” Brown told On Your Side in an interview in 2023.\n\nDoctors discovered a single water bead had ballooned inside Jonah’s intestine. He was rushed into surgery to have it removed. “There’s a group of us who’ve all had really traumatic experiences, but then there’s one mom who just doesn’t have her daughter,” Brown said. “I’ve listened to her share her story many times and we’re so lucky we’re not in that situation, but it just doesn’t feel fair that she’s not here, too.”\n\nNow, senators are considering a bipartisan bill that would ban the sale of water beads sold as toys, educational products, sensory tools or art materials for kids under 14 years old. Esther’s Law is named after a 10-month-old from Wisconsin who died last year after swallowing a water bead. The law would also require the CPSC to enact safety standards for water beads that are not banned, including potential requirements on the colors of water bead products to deter interest from children.\n\nAs On Your Side has reported, retailers, including Target, Amazon, and Walmart, have said they will voluntarily stop selling water beads marketed to children. Still, water beads remain easy to buy.\n\n“Toy manufacturers are taking them off the market and taking them out of kids toys, but they are still available at retail and being re-marketed in different categories,” said Marissa Silva, the editor-in-chief of the Toy Insider. “The biggest thing that parents can do is to be aware of the dangers that water beads pose and to make the right choices for their family. If you’ve got one older kid in the house and one younger kid in the house, it’s just something that maybe you’re going to want to avoid all together.”\n\nConsumer Reports also suggests avoiding water beads. “If you have children in the home ever, we recommend that you get rid of these,” Knight said. “Put them in a tightly concealed container and throw them away.”\n\nIn a statement, The Toy Association, which represents the toy industry, says safety standards are already in place for water beads. “Safety is the number one priority for The Toy Association and its members. Safety standards for these products exist and continue to be evaluated as to whether enhanced protections are needed. We recognize and support certain retailers’ business decisions to take steps in the interim,” the group wrote. “It is important for toy shoppers to follow the age grading information on the packaging and keep products not intended for young children out of reach.”\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

        "content": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — A stretch of a busy Arizona highway will be continuously shut down for the next several months, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation.\n\nADOT says a portion of the U.S. 60 will close between Superior and Miami beginning Thursday, May 16, for three times a week over the next six months. The closure is part of a bridge replacement project as crews begin rock blasting to replace the Queen Creek and Waterfall Canyon bridges.\n\nOn scheduled days, the blasting will force the 60 to close on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. Closures are not expected to happen every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday but will be limited to those days, ADOT says.\n\nDuring closures, drivers must detour on state routes 77 and 177 through Winkelman. The roughly 68-mile route includes a 10 percent grade and will “significantly increase travel time,” according to ADOT. Drivers should plan trips before or after the full closures because of the possibility of delays.\n\nEastbound U.S. 60 traffic will be redirected at State Route 177 in Superior, and westbound traffic will be redirected at the west end of Miami. Drivers who live between Miami and Magma Mine Road will be allowed to pass. No vehicles will be allowed between Superior and Magma Mine Road.\n\nDrivers who are on the closure route should expect lane restrictions and a slower speed limit at all times in construction zones.\n\nThe closures are required for a $44.7 million project to replace the Queen Creek and Waterfall Canyon bridges, which will improve passenger and commercial traffic for decades to come. Toward the end of the project, a multi-day closure of US 60 will be required to finish realigning the freeway with the new Queen Creek Bridge.\n\nFor more information, please visit azdot.gov/US60QueenCreekBridgeProject.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Your wallet may soon be getting thinner.\n\nVisa on Wednesday announced major changes to how credit and debit cards will operate in the U.S. in the coming months and years.\n\nThe new features could mean Americans will be carrying fewer physical cards in their wallets, and will make the 16-digit credit or debit card number printed on every card increasingly irrelevant.\n\nThey will be some of the biggest changes to how payments operate in the U.S. since the U.S. rolled out chip-embedded cards several years ago. They also come as Americans have many more options to pay for purchases beyond “credit or debit,” including buy now, pay later companies, peer-to-peer payment options, paying directly with a bank, or digital payment systems like Apple Pay.\n\n“I think (with these features) we’re getting past the point where consumers may never need to manually enter an account number ever again,” said Mark Nelsen, Visa’s global head of consumer payments, in an interview.\n\nThe biggest change coming for Americans will be the ability for banks to issue one physical payment card that will be connected to multiple bank accounts. That means no more carrying, for example, a Bank of America or Chase debit card as well as their respective credit cards in a physical wallet. Americans will be able to set criteria with their bank — such as having all purchases below $100 or with a certain merchant applied to the debit card, while other purchases go on the credit card.\n\nThe feature, already being used in Asia, will be available this summer. Buy now, pay later company Affirm is the first of Visa’s customers to roll out the feature in the U.S.\n\nSome of Visa’s new features are in response to online-payments fraud, which continues to increase as more countries adopt digital payments. The San Francisco-based company estimates that payment fraud happens roughly seven times more often online than it does in person, and there are now billions of stolen credit and debit card numbers available to criminals.\n\nOther new elements are also in response to features that non-payments companies have rolled out in recent years. The Apple Card, which uses Mastercard as its payment network, does not come with a printed 16-digit account number and Apple Card users can request a fresh credit card number at any time without having to dispose of the physical card.\n\nVisa executives see a future where banks will issue cards where the 16-digit account number, if the new cards come with them, is largely symbolic.\n\nAmong the other updates unveiled by Visa are changes to tap-to-pay features. Americans will be able to tap their credit or debit cards to their smartphones to add the card to mobile wallets, instead of using a smartphone’s camera to scan in a card’s information, or tap the card to their smartphones to approve a transaction online. Visa will also start implementing biometrics to approve transactions, similar to how Apple devices use a fingerprint or face scan to approve transactions.\n\nThe features will take time to filter down to the banks, which will decide when or what to implement for their customers. But since the banks and credit card companies are Visa’s customers, and issue cards with the Visa label, these are features that the financial institutions have been asking for.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

It shouldn’t be, oh well, we have to raise it 20% this year.”\n\nArizona’s Family has learned that Power Ranch spent more than $167,268 in legal fees last year.\n\nThat’s six times more than what was budgeted for legal expenses.\n\n“I didn’t hear any of this until February of this year,” said homeowner James Quinn. “My first thought was what the heck is going on here?”\n\nThe reason Power Ranch is spending so much money on legal fees is because of a lawsuit the HOA filed in January 2023 against a development in the Power Ranch Community called Woodcrest East.\n\nThe developer, Bela Flor, had purchased the land off Germann Road and Ranch House Pkwy in 2019 with plans on building and selling 120 luxury condominiums.\n\nThen COVID-19 hit, and Bela Flor decided it made more financial sense to rent out the condos instead, prompting the lawsuit.\n\nBela Flor has since filed a $13 million counterclaim, leaving many of the 4,000-plus Power Ranch homeowners wondering when the legal battle will end, how much more it will cost them, and what they stand to gain from all the litigation.\n\n“I do think there needs to be a lot more financial accountability on where the money is going and how it’s being spent,” said Kisler. “Endless lawsuits, I don’t think is where most residents want that money to go.”\n\nArizona’s Family reached out to the law firm representing Power Ranch, Carpenter, Hazlewood, Delgado and Bolen, and have made countless requests to do an interview with an attorney, or Power Ranch Board member, but nobody agreed to speak on camera.\n\nThe Board did respond to a number of questions in writing.\n\nWhy was the decision made to file a lawsuit against Woodcrest East LLC last year?\n\nThis Developer stated he planned to own all the Dwelling Units and rent them all out. In other words, they wanted to operate as if they were an apartment complex. However, the Tract Declaration and the Power Ranch Master Declaration did not and does not allow an apartment on this piece of property. Rather, they require a condominium. The Association requested the Developer follow the Tract Declaration and Master Declaration.\n\nWhy weren’t homeowners notified about the lawsuit and potential cost when it was filed?\n\nThe board discussed the lawsuit in a closed executive session. After carefully reviewing the facts, the Board voted unanimously to proceed. After the counterclaim was filed on February 22, 2023 the lawsuit was verbally presented at the March 27, 2023 open session. It has been since communicated on several occasions.\n\nWhy weren’t homeowners notified about the $13 million counter-lawsuit?\n\nThe Counterclaim is a matter of public record and has been discussed at multiple meetings.\n\nPower Ranch HOA dues have gone up 11% in 2023 and another 12% in 2024. Were these increases necessary because of all the money being spent on legal fees?\n\nButler Hansen, which is a third-party CPA firm that handles the Power Ranch audits, presented an inflation impact presentation to the Power Ranch community on February 13, 2024. Part of this presentation discussed consumer price index (CPI) rates for the Phoenix market since 2019 (see chart below). In summary, the cost of all goods and services have increased almost 30%. Power Ranch is dealing with the same cost increases that all other community associations have been dealing with over the last five years.\n\nThe 2023 budget was approved at the September 26, 2022 meeting. The assessment increase for 2023 was increased by 11% due to major items such as utilities, insurance, contracted services, onsite services, and an increase to the reserve contribution as recommended by the reserve study. The assessment for 2024 increased by 12% to keep up with inflation for major items such as utilities, insurance, contracted services, and landscape contract. This was not due to the money being spent on legal fees.\n\nPower Ranch’s reserves have not dropped below 30% funded. Over the last several years the Board, with the assistance of the Budget and Finance Committee, has been increasing the contribution to the reserves knowing that inflation and costs of goods and services have increased.\n\nAs outlined below, those increases have impacted the reserve balances favorably. The numbers below are the percent funded balances at the start of each year indicated. 2021: 58%; 2022: 65%; 2023: 73%; 2024: 85%.\n\nWhat is the current status of the two lawsuits? Is there any chance of a settlement?\n\nThe two active legal proceedings are currently pending and set for hearings within the next month, however, it takes both sides to reach a settlement. The Association has made significant efforts to resolve both cases. With respect to Woodcrest East, both sides agreed to mediation, and the Developer did not move from his stated position during that meeting.\n\nWith respect to the homeowner generated ALJ (Administrative Law Judge) complaint, the Association offered to approve the modification that is the subject of the ALJ complaint. However, the homeowner refused to dismiss the case and is causing the Association to incur further time and expense litigating the matter. Nevertheless, the Association is willing to settle both cases and is hopeful the other parties will do so in good faith.\n\nIs this legal battle worth all the money spent on legal fees so far?\n\nAt what point is it enough and time to settle? Upholding the integrity of the Declaration is important for the community. To date, the only offer made by the Developer is one that would allow them to operate like an apartment. This would negatively impact the Association financially.\n\nIs there a chance this lawsuit will drain all of the community funds?\n\nLitigation is always unpredictable for all sides. However, in order to mitigate the risk of the Developer claiming damages, the Association has not stopped the Developer from building and has offered to hold off on enforcing the Declaration until this case is over. Thus, the Developer will be able to operate by owning all the Dwelling Units and renting them all out unless and until a Court rules that they do not have a legal right to do so.\n\nAre there any plans to provide an update to homeowners about the current financial situation of community… and why so much money has been spent on legal fees?\n\nThere are multiple ways that homeowners are updated about the current financial situation in the community. • The community’s financial statements can be viewed by homeowners at any time by logging into the Power Ranch website. • Residents are advised of the monthly board meetings where they can attend and hear the monthly board treasurer’s reports pertaining to the association finances. •\n\nThe Finance Committee Chair reviews monthly financials and the Finance Committee discusses financials and budgets at their open meetings. • At the Annual Meeting each year, a recap of the prior year’s financial summary is shared. • Earlier this year, a Financial Town Hall was held where the third-party auditor, Paul Hansen, CPA from Butler Hansen, discussed the community’s financial state. Legal expenditures were for ongoing matters and matters that have concluded. We are unable to disclose specifics of concluded matters due to non-disclosure settlement agreements.\n\nKarl Huish, managing director with Bela Flor, said there is nothing in Arizona law that prevents them from renting out their condos, and nothing in the community rules or CC&Rs for Power Ranch or Woodcrest East prevents it either.\n\n“I am perplexed by this litigation,” said Huish. “It doesn’t make sense. In over a year of litigation, it’s never been pointed out to me what we are in violation of or what we are doing wrong. The law in Arizona is very clear that condominiums can be sold or they can be rented unless there is a specific prohibition found in CC&Rs— there is none.”\n\nAccording to state statute 33-1260.01, “a unit owner may use the unit owner’s unit as a rental property unless prohibited in the declaration and shall use it in accordance with the declaration’s rental time period restrictions.”\n\nHuish said when they purchased the vacant lot, which had sat vacant for more than a dozen years, it was clearly zoned for condominiums, and nothing has changed that, even if the Power Ranch Board wants to call them apartments.\n\nThe developer has been meeting with Power Ranch homeowners, hoping to ease any concerns they might have about the project.\n\nConstruction is 65% complete and the first units are expected to be rented out in August.\n\nHuish does not believe Power Ranch can legally stop him from renting out the condos.\n\nIn his opinion, the drawn-out lawsuits are doing nothing but costing homeowners and his company a lot of money.\n\n“We’re pretty deep in, how much deeper can we go?” said homeowner Ryan Meeks. “So I don’t know if it will be another $300,000 in legal fees, we don’t know when it will end.”\n\n“We would rather take that money and make these condominiums even more luxurious, but instead we are having to use money to pay lawyers to fight this, what I consider very unnecessary litigation,” he added.\n\nArizona’s Family has learned that homeowners in Power Ranch pay significantly more for HOA dues compared to renters.\n\nThe board claims that by allowing the units to be rented out it would result in an annual loss of more $125,000 to the association every year.\n\nA resolution may depend on whether the courts consider the 120 units in Woodcrest East to be condominiums or apartments.\n\nThe Power Ranch HOA Board claims they are apartments and are not allowed in the community.\n\nHuish insists they are condos that can legally be rented out like many others across the state.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

        "content": "MESA, AZ (AZFamily) -- Jim Stewart lives in Mesa, and like many people, he’s lucky enough to work remotely from home. “Well, I like not having to drive to a lot of places,” he told On Your Side.\n\nSo, when he checked his mailbox recently and realized he got an ER bill from Dignity Health nearly an hour away in Laveen, he was surprised. Stewart doesn’t like to drive and asks why in the world he would go to an emergency room on the other side of the Valley, which he never visits.\n\n“It’s a $2,052 bill, and I’m like, this is not mine. It has my name and my address, and all my information there. But I have never been to the Laveen hospital. I didn’t even know they had one,” he explained.\n\nOddly enough, Stewart says his insurance paid most of the mysterious bill, leaving him with that $2,052 balance. He says he called Dignity Health in Laveen and said the bill was a mistake; they must have gotten him confused with someone else. But he claims the hospital said the bill was legitimate and even offered him an 18-month payment plan.\n\n“They were basically saying you have to pay it. And I said, ‘But I didn’t do it.’ So, I’m going to make things a little rough on you. I’m going to contact some people,” he said.\n\nStewart filed criminal complaints with the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office and the Federal Trade Commission. He also got ahold of On Your Side, which he has watched for years. “I really like it (On Your Side). I like how you help innocent victims of all kinds of stuff,” he said.\n\nOn Your Side contacted Dignity Health, and after explaining the issue, they agreed to investigate. Once they did, hospital auditors realized that Stewart had a Dignity account from another Valley location. They mistakenly mixed up his information with that of another patient who visited the Laveen ER.\n\nAs a result, Dignity Health said Stewart would not be responsible for that bill and told him they would not be sending him any more demands for that $2,052 payment. Stewart says it only happened because of On Your Side.\n\n“Absolutely. If I ever have any trouble, you’ll (On Your Side) be hearing from me again. So, yes. Absolutely,” he said.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story? Please click here to report it.\n\nDo you have a photo or video of a breaking news story?

But on the Food Network competition show “Ciao House,” he set to prove his Italian cooking prowess.\n\nHe was one of 12 contestants who competed on the show.\n\nCunningham said his strength is blending the Southern flavors he knows well with Italian cuisine.\n\n“Grits in general brings up memories of my childhood,” Cunningham said on the Food Network show. “My mom would make it with love. It was always great! I grew up cooking with her in the kitchen. She had a catering company. Nine months ago, Mom and I opened up a restaurant.

The frontage road detour offers two lanes for drivers, and this is an accessible option for the northbound side, whereas on the southbound side, it is not.\n\nADOT says the I-17 northbound closure this weekend should be more smooth than last weekend's southbound closure due to drivers being able to detour on the frontage road.(Arizona's Family)\n\nADOT also says there will be:\n\n- Increased law enforcement presence on local roads directing traffic.\n\n- Increased signage on the highway and local roads to make sure drivers know where to go.\n\n- Changes in navigation apps to make sure the construction closure is shown to drivers.\n\nAfter receiving backlash for last week’s closure from Arizona drivers, ADOT spokesperson Doug Nintzel said the department is listening.\n\n“We know that things did not go well last weekend,” Nintzel said. “We’re doing all sorts of things. There will be additional local traffic-only signs, and again we’re going to recommend to not think about using the local streets in terms of a detour.”\n\nIf you’re headed up north this weekend, Nintzel advises you to hit the road before the closure starts or start driving during non-peak times.\n\nThe I-17 northbound between Loop 303 and SR-74 will be closed from Friday at 10 p.m. to Monday at 5 a.m.\n\nFor more on traffic, closures, detours, best routes and gas prices, head to Arizona Family’s First Alert Traffic Page.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

        "content": "PHOENIX (AZFamily)—We’ve all seen random junk on the freeways and city streets, and we’ve also likely seen vehicles piled high with stuff that looks like it will fall onto the road.\n\nThese dangerous drivers cause hundreds of crashes every year in Arizona, at times even causing death.\n\nArizona’s Family Investigates looked into the issue and found it’s worsening. Road debris accounts for about a third of crashes that state troopers respond to. That’s despite public campaigns with slogans like “Don’t Trash Arizona” and “Secure Your Loads.”\n\nPaul Reif said he thinks about his son and what happened every single day. A photo is all he has left.\n\n“He was the type of kid that every parent would want,” Reif said.\n\nMatthew died after a piece of sheet metal came flying up off the road through his windshield. 18 years later, Paul still gets choked up talking about it.\n\n“I don’t want anyone else to be in my shoes. Not ever,” Reif said.\n\nYet junk keeps ending up on our freeways.\n\nDetective Nick Cureton knows that firsthand.\n\n“It happened so quickly I didn’t have a lot of time to react,” Mesa Police Det. Cureton said.\n\nThe longtime Mesa Police Officer walked us through his close encounter with a roof rack in 2022.\n\n“As the vehicle in front of me came into contact with it basically went right through my windshield and ended up hitting me in the chest as it went through,” Det. Cureton explained.\n\nHe somehow managed to pull over and radio for help. He said two other drivers also stopped to assist.\n\n“I instantly recognized I had glass in my eyes. I had glass in my mouth,” Det. Cureton said. “I was in the hospital for a little bit but luckily I was able to go home that same day,” he continued.\n\nStories like these are why the Arizona Department of Public Safety considers stuff on our roads an emergency. Arizona’s Family Investigates rode along with them to better understand the problem.\n\n“We don’t want anyone to get hurt,” Sgt. Eric Andrews with DPS said. “I had no idea how much you see on a daily basis.”\n\nIt didn’t take long to spot something concerning.\n\n“We’ve got a ton of debris here. We’ve got all this wood in the road... Those big pieces they’ll pop your tire real easily, who knows if there’s nails in them,” Sgt. Andrews explained.\n\nAccording to DPS, in 2022, debris on state roads led to 1,100 crashes and nine deaths. Between 2019 and 2023, these incidents made up 32% of all crashes in Arizona, but a whopping 68% in Maricopa and Pinal counties.\n\n“We do not ask that civilians stop and try to take it out of the road themselves. You’re putting yourself at risk,” Sgt. Andrews said.\n\nHe also pointed out what those who use hauling loads should be doing.\n\n“Using a ratchet is the best way,” he said.\n\nThe Arizona Department of Transportation also responds to some of these calls and works to raise awareness.\n\nThey showed Arizona’s Family Investigates the bin they collect some of the junk they’ve collected. It had a ton of stuff in just three to four days.\n\n“As I’ve often said it’s everything, including the kitchen sink,” Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) spokesperson Doug Nintzel said.\n\nIn Arizona, the law states that you must secure your load. If not, authorities can charge you with a class 2 misdemeanor and fine you up to $500 if someone is seriously injured.\n\nSgt. Andrews said he didn’t believe stiff penalties would make a difference. “Honestly because they usually don’t stick around it probably, it would be hard for us to find them,” he explained.\n\nHe estimates drives only stick around about 5% of the time.\n\nReif agrees law enforcement isn’t the answer. He said it’s “common sense.”\n\n“Secure your load as if someone you love was driving behind you,” Reif stressed.\n\nDuring this latest legislative session, lawmakers amended the existing law on securing your load to include “streets” and “roads.” It means drivers can be charged and fined for violations on all types of roads, not just highways.\n\nJune 6th is National Secure Your Load Day, honoring the day Reif’s son died. He plans to speak at the event ADOT and DPS are hosting in Phoenix on that day.\n\nDPS said if you see trash and junk on the road, call 911.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

        "content": "GILBERT, AZ (AZFamily) — Boarded-up windows and a sign saying “closed for remodeling” serve as a reminder of a devastating car crash at the Dragon Wok in Gilbert.\n\n“It reminded me of something out of a movie. I was just speechless,” said the restaurant owner’s son, Michael Szeto, as he recalled the crash.\n\nSzeto’s parents opened the restaurant 19 years ago, but now the ovens are off, and the workers sit idle as they work on repairs. A portion of their kitchen was damaged, so Szeto’s parents said they’ve been picking up decorations and cleaning up these past two days.\n\nThe car crashed into their restaurant, where customers typically wait to be seated, but the crash happened before they opened. Szeto said his mother was actually supposed to be inside during the crash, but something kept her away.\n\n“She was actually planning on being here 30 minutes earlier and through the grace of God something held her back. I think it was a phone call and she ended up being a little late.”\n\nThe building repairs aren’t the only cost they are having to worry about. Following the crash, they had to shut off the building’s power, which meant all their food went bad and needed to be thrown out.\n\nSzeto said his family also wants to pay their employees when they are closed.\n\n“They have families too and I really feel for them.”\n\nWhile this whole ordeal is incredibly stressful, he said his family couldn’t be more grateful to the Gilbert community.\n\n“We can’t wait to start serving our community again, and thank you guys for standing with us. We really appreciate you guys.”\n\nThe family has set up a GoFundMe to help cover the cost of repairs.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

        "content": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) —A jury awarded a former City of Scottsdale prosecutor more than $5 million.\n\nThe jury found that Shawn Fuller was wrongfully terminated by the city in 2020 after being falsely accused of gender discrimination. His lawyer says Fuller’s firing happened while auditing Scottsdale’s DUI case management.\n\nFuller says he found nine Scottsdale DUI cases where defendants’ blood tests came back negative for drugs and alcohol, but they weren’t made aware of their results.\n\nHe says those nine people pleaded guilty even though the tests cleared them.\n\nDUI attorney Lawrence Koplow, who was in the courtroom during this trial, tells Arizona’s Family that he believes the jury made the right call based on the evidence. Koplow, who was not involved in this case, says what was revealed in this civil lawsuit should be a glaring red flag for the people of Scottsdale.\n\n“Some of these people were sentenced. Some of these people went to jail,” Koplow said.\n\nHe says the trial showed the allegations of harassment and gender discrimination against Fuller were vague at best and pointed to the timing of his termination as suspicious.\n\nThe City of Scottsdale disagrees.\n\nScottsdale hired Fuller as a city prosecutor in 2019 but was fired three months later. Court documents show that when starting with the city, Fuller was allegedly made aware of a rumor and began an audit.\n\n“The rumor was that the office was not disclosing exculpatory lab reports to defendants in DUI cases,” said Joshua Carden, Fuller’s attorney.\n\nFuller’s five-year audit also found that allegedly city paralegals—not attorneys—were showing up to arraignments for DUIs\n\nKoplow says paralegals cannot represent people charged with crimes or offer legal advice. He says this is a severe ethics violation, and that’s not all.\n\n“But it’s not every person. It’s usually unrepresented people. It’s usually people who don’t have the money to hire private counsel,” Koplow said.\n\nThe lawsuit claims those represented by the paralegals would plead guilty despite not having a positive drug test, which Koplow says is typically the primary evidence used in these cases.\n\n“They found nine cases. Then Shawn, rightfully, says we can’t stop at five years,” Koplow said.\n\nUpon finding the results, Fuller wanted to go back to see who else this may have happened to.\n\nBut before he could do that, Fuller’s attorney says that he had been fired for harassment. The jury found he was wrongfully terminated and did not harass any coworkers.\n\nKoplow says it was clear the jury found the timing suspicious.\n\n“Does one need to go to law school to put two and two together? I don’t think so. And also, why hasn’t the City of Scottsdale gone back since then. I mean obviously they don’t want the answer,” Koplow said.\n\nThe City of Scottsdale provided this statement on the lawsuit:\n\n“The City of Scottsdale is incredibly disappointed by the jury verdict in this case and will appeal. The city categorically denies any wrongdoing. During his three months of at-will employment, Mr. Fuller’s conduct generated numerous complaints from different staff who worked in his office. An outside independent investigator sustained several allegations of misconduct in violation of city administrative regulation. As a result, his employment was terminated. The independent investigator’s report was produced, as Arizona law requires, pursuant to a public records request. The city knows it acted appropriately in this employment matter, and is confident that this ruling will be successfully appealed.”\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

Police say the video contradicts Dr. De Luigi’s story that he was pushed first. They say no one ever shoved him before slamming a stranger to the ground.\n\nMayo Clinic confirmed to Arizona’s Family on Wednesday that “this physician is no longer employed by Mayo Clinic.”\n\nIn a report, Scottsdale Police say the now-former Mayo Clinic doctor was “clearly intoxicated, slurring his words, and smelled of alcohol.” He was escorted out after being asked to leave. Officers told him not to come back to the event the rest of the week.\n\n“Your job as a cop is over!” De Luigi said to an officer on the body camera video. “You’re going to jail,” replied an officer.\n\nAfter being kicked out of the WM Phoenix Open, a security camera caught De Luigi pushing over signs and throwing metal fences outside the Bird’s Nest concert venue. The video shows him stumbling around and then shoving a woman down to the pavement.\n\n“Two hand shove, like just charged her. She went back, she hit her head and then probably four or five of us grabbed him and held him down,” a witness told an officer during an interview captured on body camera video.\n\n“He was throwing all the railings down and I said ‘hey, stop’ and he just ran at me as fast as he could and slammed me down to the ground,” said the victim, Katie Clayton, to an officer during an interview captured on body camera video.\n\nClayton and her husband are suing De Luigi and his wife. They are asking for compensation for medical expenses and lost wages due to him “suddenly, unexpectedly, negligently, and without warning or provocation ran at Plaintiff Katie Clayton at full speed and body-slammed her into the pavement, causing severe injuries,” the complaint read.\n\n“I was accosted by them. I pushed a sign down. They pushed me down,” said De Luigi to police on body camera video.\n\nDe Luigi claims he didn’t start it.\n\n“I did not mean to knock her down, I knocked her down because I was knocking, responding to her pushing me in the back,” he said.\n\nHe was arrested for assault and disorderly conduct and placed on administrative leave from his position as the Chair of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and the Director of Sports Medicine at Mayo Clinic in Arizona.\n\n“I’m a doctor who volunteered today,” De Luigi told police on body camera video. “I take care of your fellow police officers every day of my life.”\n\nArizona’s Family has learned the victim’s husband is part of the Thunderbirds.\n\nDuring his arrest, De Luigi told officers he was invited to the golf tournament that day by the head of that organization.\n\nHe’s due back in court June 4, 2024.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

Depending upon the variant, depending upon the infection,” said Dr. Helene Felman, division chief of general pediatrics and associate professor of pediatrics at Banner University Medical Center.\n\nThe KP.2 variant is now identified as the dominant COVID strain, but it’s just one of many variants that make up what is referred to as the FLiRT variants.\n\nMore from Rene Romo\nASU Prep Academy coming to southern Arizona\nMiss USA praised for prioritizing mental health\nArizona genetic abnormality abortion ban ongoing\nHouse Judiciary Committee hosts hearing in Sahuarita\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visits Tucson to discuss fentanyl crisis\n\nAnd while they all have their own differences, they have also all mutated from the former dominant JN.1 variant, but according to one official from the Pima County Health Department, variants are nothing new.\n\n“New variants of COVID-19 are detected like almost on a weekly basis.

        "content": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — The fallout from the sober living scandal continues.\n\nThat scandal cost taxpayers $2 billion and led the state’s Medicaid program to implement more regulation.\n\nNow, some providers say those regulations have been poorly implemented, leading them to go months without being paid.\n\nThis involves Native Americans and the medical care they rely on.\n\nArizona’s Family Investigates continues to follow it closely and spoke with a small company that has helped hundreds of Native Americans with mental health issues get clean.\n\nInfinity Groups Homes said they’re in danger of closing.\n\n“My addiction is what led me to Infinity,” said Elliott Chee, who is an Infinity Groups Homes success story. “I’m a recovering alcoholic and meth addict. So that was my drug of choice to help self-medicate.”\n\nBut he knew he needed to change. It brought him from the Navajo Nation down to Phoenix and ultimately into one of Infinity’s behavioral health residential facilities, where he underwent many months of intense counseling and treatment.\n\nYears later, sober, he returned to help other addicts.\n\n“The unique thing about me is that I’m also in recovery so I know what they’re going through, the feelings, the emotions, the uncertainty, the fear, the anxiety,” he said.\n\nInfinity explains they’re one step above sober living homes. Their residents aren’t allowed to leave the home during treatment. They receive round-the-clock care and must have a diagnosed mental illness and substance abuse problem to be admitted.\n\nStill, they said shortly after Gov. Katie Hobbs and Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes announced a crackdown on sober living homes back in May 2023, citing $2 billion in taxpayer fraud, they too began having problems getting paid.\n\n“If I ask, ‘Can I speak with a supervisor,’ or someone who knows more about this, they take my number and I never get a call back,” Farrell Tso, a billing manager at Infinity, said.\n\nArizona’s Family Investigates has heard similar stories from several other providers.\n\nThey operate through the American Indian Health Plan, which is under the umbrella of Arizona’s Medicaid Program, known as AHCCCS.\n\n“They say hey we’ll put a note into the RN nurses and they’ll get back to you, but we never get a response, or we’ll get a response and it’s not clear enough,” Augustine Ayze said.\n\n“We’ve never done anything against policy. We’ve never broke the rules,” Tso said.\n\nSince all this started, Infinity said they’ve struggled to make payroll each week.\n\nThey never know how much money is going to come in.\n\nThey’ve closed five of their six homes and had to lay off 40-plus employees.\n\nThey said they recently met with AHCCCS, but it went nowhere.\n\nArizona’s Family Investigates asked Chee why he keeps coming to work when he’s not getting paid.\n\n“Who will?” Chee said. “I was given an opportunity, and that purpose is to make sure I show up every day,” he continued.\n\nIn response to Arizona’s Family Investigates calls and emails, AHCCCS released the following statement:\n\n“Many providers will need to adjust their billing practices to comply with existing AHCCCS standards. While this may create additional processes for providers, it is essential to reducing fraud. We are working with providers to address their needs with additional training and technical assistance.\n\nUnder AHCCCS policy, BHRFs are required to submit an assessment and treatment plan that document the medical necessity of the services the member will receive at the BHRF. Information regarding these policies can be found on the AHCCCS website: https://www.azahcccs.gov/PlansProviders/FeeForServiceHealthPlans/PriorAuthorization/index.html.\n\nApproval of a prior authorization request may be held if more information is needed and requested from the provider. Providers are also entitled to request a reconsideration of a prior authorization denial if they believe the determination was made in error, however prior authorization must be approved prior to rendering the services to an AHCCCS member.”\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

(FOX5) - In life, we can sometimes take the little things for granted such as having the ability to walk outside or being able to rest when our body needs to.\n\nHowever, for one little boy in the Las Vegas area, those normal things come as a challenge.\n\nCarter is 7-years-old and is your average kid. FOX5 was able to spend an afternoon with Carter to get to know his personality and how he is dealing with the rare skin condition that he was born with.\n\nWe soon realized, even though this little boy has a lot on his plate, he stronger than many of us.\n\n“My skin was hurting super bad when I woke up,” Carter said.\n\nCarter was born with two rare skin conditions called lamellar ichthyosis and ectropion. He was diagnosed with autism later.\n\n“His body over produces skin at rapid rate but his skin cell turnover isn’t up to par to release the dead skin cells,” his mom Shai Bresee said.\n\nCarter’s skin condition is far beyond just severe dry skin, his mom tells FOX5 she has to moisturize Carter up to seven times a day with special products.\n\n“We have to be very careful because we can cause more damage than good over exfoliating,” Bresee said.\n\nEven if his skin is soothed, Carter has another challenge that his mom can’t make better.\n\nGofundme goal for 7 year old dealing with rare skin condition doubles in 24 hours\n\n“His skin is so dry and tight that it pulls his upper lids basically flat,” Bresee said.\n\nCarter has not been able to close his eye lids since he was born. He has to sleep with his eyes open.\n\n“Why does such a great kid have to go through all of these every day struggles just to experience these normal day to day things,” Bresee said.\n\nThis summer Carter will get a skin graft surgery on his eye lids so he can hopefully close them for the very first time.\n\n“I’m going through a lot. It hurts, but I have to go through it until I get surgery and then it won’t really hurt anymore.” Carter said.\n\nFor it to not hurt anymore, the family will have to travel to San Diego for surgery, but it will get costly for the family which is why they are asking for help through this GoFundMe.\n\n“He will struggle no matter what we do so all we can do is help him struggle with less things,” Bresee said.\n\nEven through all the pain, Carter is still your every day kid. He tells FOX5, he likes to play video games, watch the Vegas Golden Knights and chill at home.\n\nWhen we told him he is like a real life super hero with how strong he is, he agreed.\n\nCarter’s condition makes his skin so sensitive it is hard to play in the park like the other kids, and when he does he has to wear a cooling vest.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

        "content": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — The fight to prevent destructive wildfires is a global issue, and scientists right here in Arizona are at the forefront.\n\nOver the last 10 years, wildfires have burned more than 70 million acres across the United States, with some of the largest sparking in the past five years. Alexander Shenkin, an assistant research professor at Northern Arizona University, said all the fires are costing money, homes and forests.\n\n“Fires cost, in the U.S. west, half a trillion dollars of damage and losses every year, which is bonkers,” Shenkin said.\n\nScientists in Flagstaff are on the front, spearheading research for fire detection and prevention. It’s something David Trilling, chair of NAU’s Department of Astronomy and Planetary Science, says hits home for people in the community.\n\n“I think for us, because we all have seen the fires on the mountains here and the flooding that comes after and the loss of property and the impacts on our daily lives and our neighbors and our friends,” Trilling said.\n\nThat’s led NAU scientists, Flagstaff engineers, and fire leaders with the same passion for preventing wildfires to come together. They formed Team Snuffed, one of 20 teams worldwide (the only one from Arizona) to make it to the XPRIZE Wildfire semifinals, a global showcase of fire prevention techniques.\n\nTheir winning idea: a string of fire-detecting satellites.\n\n“For our system, what we proposed is we stick 90 satellites in this one orbit that’s going over and over the western U.S.,” Shenkin explained. “Then we’re going to have a revisit rate, every minute, to watch every minute to see if this little piece of ground has caught fire.”\n\nThe satellites use a camera system made originally by NAU students.\n\n“This thing I’m holding is a 3D print one-to-one scale model of the camera that we’re going to put on our satellites,” Trilling said. “So, it’s less than 10 centimeters each side; the whole thing weighs about a pound.”\n\nFor the final phase of the competition in 2025, the team will launch their satellites and put them to the test.\n\nThey’re looking for funding and partners for this phase and say every penny is worth it.\n\n“Say 100 million bucks to stick this constellation of satellites in the air,” Shenkin said. “Sounds like a lot of money, but if it’s stopping even a fraction of those massive wildfires we’ve all seen on TV, it’s going to be a game changer.”\n\nRegardless if they win the $11 million prize, Trilling said they believe in this technology and want to see it advance.\n\n“The goal is not to win the XPRIZE competition,” Trilling said. “It’s actually to do something that makes the world a better place.”\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

Dr. Jordan Jacobs was one of the trauma surgeons who operated on Blake.\n\n“He is such a special person I’ll never forget Blake.

        "content": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — The legal battle over a crucial piece of evidence in the trial of a man accused of killing a Scottsdale woman in 2015 is heading to the state’s highest court.\n\nThe Arizona Supreme Court said last week it has granted the petition for review and will hear oral arguments regarding the admission of DNA evidence in the trial of Ian Mitcham.\n\nProsecutors and the defense team must file different briefs, documents and responses by July 1. The high court will hear the arguments sometime after that, but no date has been set.\n\nMitcham was arrested for the murder of Allison Feldman, who was sexually assaulted, strangled and beaten to death at her Scottsdale home in February 2015.\n\nThe case went cold until 2018 police say they ran a familial DNA test compared to the DNA they found at the home. It identified an Arizona prison inmate, Mark Mitcham, as a close relative.\n\nThat led police officers to track and eventually arrest Ian Mitcham.\n\nHowever, before the trial was set to start in December 2022, the battle over the DNA started.\n\nHis defense attorneys take issue with DNA evidence because they say the only reason why police had a DNA sample from Ian Mitcham is because officers didn’t destroy a blood sample connected to a DUI arrest in January 2015, a month before Feldman’s murder, like they were supposed to.\n\nThe lawyers argued his Fourth Amendment rights were violated and the blood sample should have been destroyed three months after the 2015 arrest.\n\nA Maricopa County Superior Court judge agreed and threw out the DNA evidence.\n\nProsecutors appealed the decision, and in August, the Arizona Court of Appeals reversed the decision, saying probable cause supported his arrest, and once he pleaded guilty to the felony charges, the DNA profile was properly in the state’s possession.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

        "content": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes is suing an online giant e-commerce company for alleged “unfair and deceptive” business practices.\n\nMayes announced on Wednesday that her office has sued Amazon in two separate lawsuits, accusing the billion-dollar company of artificially inflating prices for consumers and harming small third-party businesses.\n\n“Amazon must be held accountable for these violations of our state laws. No matter how big and powerful, all businesses must play by the same rules and follow the same laws as everyone else,” Mayes said in a statement.\n\nThe first lawsuit focuses on Amazon’s cancelation process, which Mayes claims is “intentionally confusing and misleading.” The suit alleges that Amazon required customers to undergo a complicated process with “skewed wording, confusing choices, and repeated nudging” — a strategy they called Project Illiad. Mayes says these methods are known as “dark patterns” that manipulate the buyer’s choices. Documents reportedly showed Project Illiad reduced Amazon’s cancelations by 14%.\n\nThe second lawsuit targets Amazon’s Buy Box algorithm, which determines which offer appears in the “Buy Now” or “Add to Cart” options. The suit claims that instead of putting the product that customers would prefer or is cheaper, it was biased toward offers that increased Amazon’s profits. In addition, Amazon reportedly favored its own products or FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) items, which in turn hurt third-party sellers.\n\n“Arizona consumers deserve to be treated fairly and without deception by big corporations like Amazon, and small businesses deserve a level playing field,” Mayes said. “Amazon should change its business practices to comply with Arizona law.”\n\nHowever, Amazon released a statement in response to Mayes’ claims, stating that the attorney general didn’t review any documents, which resulted in a “misunderstanding” regarding Amazon’s business practices.\n\nAmazon’s full statement is below:\n\n“We are surprised and disappointed by these cases, which the Arizona Attorney General initiated without reviewing a single document from Amazon, resulting in a fundamental misunderstanding and mischaracterization of how Amazon’s businesses work.\n\n“Prime’s sign-up and cancellation processes are clear and simple by design, meeting a high bar for customer satisfaction well above legal requirements. Customers sign up for Prime because it’s an incredible service and a great value, and they can cancel their Prime membership with a few clicks from the home page.\n\n“These suits would force Amazon to engage in practices that actually harm consumers and the many businesses that sell in our store—such as having to feature higher prices.”\n\nAmazon Spokesperson Tim Doyle\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

        "content": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — LIX is the brainchild of Rich Dolan, a Phoenix local since 1996. The scratch-made ice cream shop was born from his 30 years in the food and hospitality business, his love of ice cream, passion for quality, high standards for customer service and his personal lactose intolerance. The lactose intolerance came as a result of Rich’s battle with cancer, which he ultimately conquered!\n\nConceived during the COVID-19 pandemic, Rich’s intention for LIX was to open an ice cream shop where you could walk through the door and leave all of the outside stressors in the world at the door while eating the best ice cream you have ever had.\n\nWhen most of us were perfecting our sourdough bread recipes during lockdown, Rich began churning ice cream at home, creating flavors like roasted sweet corn and raspberry. He would leave pints hanging on neighbors’ doors due to social distancing, and the neighbors raved about the ice cream and the flavors. Rich knew he had a winner!\n\nRich was concerned about mentioning that his ice cream was lactose-free, although it’s still 100% dairy-made ice cream and qualifies as a super-premium ice cream product.\n\nRich Dolan created LIX Uptown Ice Cream by combining his love for the sweet treat and his personal lactose intolerance.\n\nThe dilemma was that most people would hear lactose-free and assume that it’s not real ice cream. Rich decided to follow his desire to make a difference in this world and proudly make it clear that LIX is lactose-free. He says seeing the reactions on the faces of folks who haven’t been able to enjoy real ice cream without getting sick for years is priceless! To know that LIX has made their lives better in some small way is truly inspiring.\n\nAt LIX, they start every batch with the intention of provoking a serendipitous experience for each guest. Only positive vibes are allowed in the kitchen when they churn; they often make it a dance party!\n\nRich says when you come to LIX, he wants customers to check the world at the door, have some fun and laugh while eating the BEST ICE CREAM OF YOUR LIFE!\n\nLIX Uptown Ice Cream | Phone: 602-908-3630 | Address: 635 W Glenrosa Ave #106 Phoenix AZ 85013 | Website: www.getyourlix.com | Instagram: @lixuptown\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

        "content": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — Consumer household debt hit $17.69 trillion in the first quarter of 2024, according to a new report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It’s an increase of $184 billion in the first three months of the year.\n\nMortgage debt went up $190 billion, and auto debt jumped $9 billion, while student loan debt fell $6 billion. Credit card debt also dropped $14 billion, but consumers still owe $1.12 trillion on credit cards alone. That’s a 13% increase from the same time last year.\n\n“There’s this interesting phenomenon where post-holidays, people often go on a bit of a spending detox and they use their tax refund money to pay off credit card debt,” said Bankrate’s Ted Rossman. “We did eke out a slight decrease, but not as much of a decrease as we usually see. That could maybe foreshadow a little bit of trouble for later in the year just because balances usually do rise in the second and third quarters, then they really jump in the fourth quarter around the holidays.”\n\nThe latest inflation data from the U.S. Department of Labor shows inflation cooled slightly in April to 3.4%, but inflation remains a major factor in financial challenges for consumers.\n\n“Gen Z’ers have more credit card debt and more credit card delinquencies than millennials did at the same age, which is potentially worrisome and is wrapped up in all these higher costs for everything,” Rossman said. “At the end of the day though, it does bring me back to that fork in the road between 56% of card holders who pay in full, and life is great, and they get rewards and convenience and buyer protections, and the other 44% have a very expensive debt cycle.”\n\nIf you’re part of that 44% of people who carry a credit card balance, there are solutions to pay it off. Evaluate monthly income and expenses and set a budget. Then cut costs to free up more money to apply to credit card balances.\n\nRossman also said, if you qualify, a 0% balance transfer credit card may help you pay off debt faster. There will likely be a 3-5% fee up front but could save you in interest if you pay off the debt in full by the end of the promotional period.\n\n“I still think it’s well worth it, provided you can make progress,” Rossman said. “That’s the thing. You don’t want to just kick the can down the road.”\n\nThe New York Fed’s report also highlights an increase in serious delinquencies of 90 days or more past due on mortgages, car loans and credit cards.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

Easily redirected by the handler when play or treats are offered\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

        "content": "Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker ordered all city employees to go back to in-office work at an announcement held at City Hall on Monday. On Monday morning, Parker held a special meeting with members of the press in order to explain the need for workers to return to the office five days a week. \"In alignment with my administration's goals of creating a more visible and accessible government, I have notified all city workers that they will be transitioning to full-time in office work,\" she said. She said she's going to require all city employees to return full time to the office effective Monday, July 15. \"Employee presence at the workplace allows for more personal and productive interactions,\" Parker said. \"It facilitates communication. It promotes social connections as well as collaboration, innovation and inclusion. It also delivers on my promise of an accessible workforce that is best situated to serve the people of Philadelphia.\" Parker said this ruling \"establishes generally\" that all work will be done on-site and it will sunset the city's virtual work policy that was put in place in 2021. As the city works toward that July deadline, Parker said they are working with managers to prepare office space, equipment and other supports to prepare for employees to return. \"Our workforce is the only way that Philadelphia truly becomes what I promised to the people, that is the safest, cleanest, greenest big city in America, with access to economic opportunity for all,\" she said. According to the City of Philadelphia, the city employs at least 25,000 people. Parker said Monday that about 80% of this workforce have been working fully on-site since last year. Of the remaining 20%, Parker said, city employees worked between 31 to 75 hours per-pay-period on site. However, a reporter in the room on Monday pointed out that there were no leaders of the unions that represent city workers on hand for the morning announcement. \"I cannot affirm that any of the union presidents for the City of Philadelphia have embraced this,\" Parker admitted. Though, Parker said union leaders have been notified of the return to work demand. In a statement release following the mayor's announcement, David Wilson, president of AFSCME Local 2187, a union that supports municipal workers, said he was \"disheartened\" by the mayor's decision. \"We are disheartened to hear that the mayor decided to unilaterally implement returning my members to work 5 days a week on July 15. This to us, is a mandatory subject of bargaining to which the city clearly doesn’t,\" he said in a statement. \"Making such an impactful change in the middle of summer or in general, directly harms our members, their families and creates chaos. It has become clearer than ever that the mayor doesn’t not care for her city work force. Her actions speak louder than words.\" Earlier this year, Parker called senior city employees back to work. That started on March 4. This is a breaking news story. It will be updated as new information becomes available.",

Around 6,000 graduates attended the day's ceremony. In a letter to students and families, school officials said, in addition to the added security screening protocols, no bags other than \"small wallets and clutch-style purses\" will be allowed in Franklin Field. Also, officials with the school said, no noisemakers, signs, posters, flags or golf-umbrellas, will be permitted at the event. And, all students showed ID in order to be permitted access to the field.

Kelce joked that her husband is \"known for giving some pretty earth-shattering speeches. He did not help me at writing my words today, so you can go ahead and lower those expectations.\" Kelce went on to tell the grads of Cabrini's 64th and final graduating class that the Cabrini alum remain to be a support system for the class of 2024, even if the college on the Main Line is no more. \"You are not alone in trying to navigate the conundrum of life,\" she told the grads. Kelce is a a 2017 graduate of Cabrini. In a Facebook post while announcing Kelce as a speaker, Cabrini described her as a \"standout field hockey athlete and coach, and advocate for girls and women in sports.\" \"One of the best decisions I've ever made was to become a part of the Cabrini field hockey family,\" Kelce told Cabrini's website. \"The experience gave me memories and friendships that will last a lifetime.\" This graduation marked the end of Cabrini after it was founded in 1957. Villanova University agreed to purchase the Radnor campus last year as Cabrini University dealt with money problems. \"In a shifting and increasingly difficult higher ed landscape, Cabrini University, like so many colleges and universities, has faced significant financial challenges stemming from declining enrollment, the pandemic, and economic uncertainty,\" Nova and Cabrini said in a joint statement last June. \"Despite efforts to improve revenue streams, and changes to the leadership and academic ranks, Cabrini’s operating deficit remained insurmountable. With all other possible options exhausted and having determined that they must conclude their operations, Cabrini University initiated discussions with Villanova around a plan that would preserve Cabrini’s legacy and mission and honor the original intention for the Cabrini campus to promote opportunities in Catholic education.\"",

        "content": "The family of a man who was executed by the state of Pennsylvania after being convicted of murder in 1931 have filed a lawsuit seeking damages nearly 100 years after his death. On Monday, attorneys for the family of Alexander McClay Williams, who was executed by the state when he was just 16-years-old, announced that they were bringing forward a lawsuit over Williams' execution after his conviction was vacated in 2022 and a new trial was ordered. However, Williams was not retried posthumously. In fact, his record was expunged back in 2017. Williams' family have long professed his innocence. In fact, in 2022, in dismissing charges against the teen, Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer argued that Williams should never have faced charges in the first place. “Sadly, we cannot undo the past. We cannot rewrite history to erase the egregious wrongs of our forebearers,” Stollsteimer said then. “However, when, as here, justice can be served by publicly acknowledging such a wrong, we must seize that opportunity.\" Now, citing Williams' wrongful conviction and death, his family has brought a lawsuit against the state and Delaware County. The suit seeks unspecified punitive damages. Willams' was convicted after 34-year-old Vida Robare, a white house matron at the Glen Mills School for Boys, was found murdered inside her cottage on the school grounds on October 3, 1930. Her body was discovered by her ex-husband Fred Robare, who was also an employee at the school. Williams was arrested and charged with stabbing Robare 47 times. However, there were no witnesses to the crime and he was never seen at the scene. Instead, prosecutors relied on confessions that were coerced out of the 16-year-old Williams. The lawsuit notes that, in working to convict Williams, prosecutors ignored other evidence -- including that Robare had filed for divorce from her husband, Fred, citing \"extreme cruelty\" as the reason. Her husband was the first to find her body on the day she was murdered. Williams was executed June. 8, 1931. Attorneys for Williams' family said in a statement that, Sam Lemon, the great-grandson of Williams' criminal trial attorney -- William H. Ridley -- uncovered information showing that evidence against Williams was fabricated. In 2022, after hearing the new evidence presented the Court of Common Pleas for Delaware County vacated the conviction and ordered a new trial. Then, Stollsteimer dismissed the case, the attorneys noted in a statement.",

        "content": "Residents of a New Jersey town are looking to fight a plan conceived by local lawmakers to exterminate Canada geese. The plan by the Peapack-Gladstone Borough Council would allow federal officials to euthanize the birds with carbon dioxide. The council made the decision after several failed attempts to take care of a geese population they claim is out of control. The method, which involves rounding up the birds during \"molting\" season, when they cannot fly, is approved by the federal government. \"The Borough Council appreciates those expressing their opinion regarding the infestation of the invasive species of geese that have inhabited Liberty Park. Indeed, the infestation has been a vexing issue for the Borough for some twenty years now. It is not a new issue,\" the council wrote in a statement regarding the geese. \"The Borough has tried every reasonable, humane effort to discourage these animals from occupying our Park. Some have worked temporarily, but none have provided a permanent solution.\" The council said that they opted to have the \"invasive\" birds removed by the USDA, a solution that gives them the best chance of controlling the infestation of geese. \"The US Fish and Wildlife Service has stated that a manageable population of Canadian Geese in New Jersey is 41,000; the current population of these birds in New Jersey is estimated to exceed 70,000,\" the council statement read. In addition to tearing up plantings, the council said that the birds are \"a threat to Park users, both human and animal,\" as they could spread disease and their behavior could put some people in harm's way. \"It is unfortunate that these birds have chosen the Park to make their home, however their presence is simply incompatible with safety and enjoyment by our residents,\" the council said. The gaggle of geese also impacts the water quality in the park's pond so much that the borough has had to treat the water to prevent large algae blooms. But there are still many in the town that oppose the drastic measure about to be taken. A change.com petition had already garnered more than 2,000 signatures ahead of the weekend.",

        "content": "A group of about 75 protesters have set up tents on Drexel University's campus in West Philadelphia, forcing the buildings to be placed on lockdown, according to the school's president. The group made their way over to Drexel around 7 p.m. Saturday where they set up tents on the Academic Quadrangle as police set up barricades to control the crowd. \"We wanna keep it peaceful at the same time. We don't want anyone to get hurt, just want people to be heard,\" Drexel University senior Kendell Lewis, of Bucks County, told NBC10. The rally has been peaceful so far with no physical violence, but the protesters have definitely been loud and passionate. Some have been calling officers names and calling for Palestinians to be free. A group by the name of Drexel Palestine Coalition released a statement on Saturday night that shed more light on the protesters setting up tents as well as what they are hoping to accomplish. A spokesperson with the group called the tent set up a \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment,\" and said that community members of the city of Philadelphia are part of the protest. Police in Philadelphia told NBC10 that not all of the protesters are Drexel students and some aren't even students at all. A Drexel University alumni was among the crowd and said, \"Open the books, let us see what it is, right, let us see where you're actually spending your money, and democratically we should be able to decide, as students who go to the area, who work for the schools, we should be the ones to decide where that money goes and what's done with it.” Law enforcement officials arrived to the campus dressed in riot gear just before 9 p.m. in response to the crowd. Some responding officers wore helmets and carried shields. Drexel University's President John Fry shared a statement on the encampment and protest Saturday. \"Drexel Police and Public Safety are closely monitoring this demonstration to ensure that it is peaceful and non-disruptive to normal operations, and that participants and passersby will behave respectfully toward one another. We will be prepared to respond quickly to any disruptive or threatening behavior by anyone against anyone,\" Fry said in the statement. \"We will not tolerate the destruction of property; the harassment or intimidation of our students, faculty or professional staff; or threatening behavior of any kind, including speech that is explicitly racist, antisemitic, or Islamophobic, that creates a hostile environment for members of our community based on race, color, national origin, religious affiliation, or shared ancestry. Nor will we allow anyone who is not a member of the Drexel community to trespass into our buildings and student residences. At the present time, our buildings are on lockdown and open only to those with clearance from Drexel’s Public Safety.\" The protest started around 4 p.m. outside of City Hall. Our cameras then captured hundreds of people who could be seen walking down JFK Boulevard in Center City in front of the Comcast Center just before 5:30 p.m. on Saturday. Some were holding signs while others were carrying Palestinian flags. Today's protest comes one day after 19 people were arrested, including six University of Pennsylvania students, on Friday night after attempting to occupy a building on the University of Pennsylvania campus, a university spokesperson said. Seven of the students arrested on Friday remained in custody Saturday awaiting felony charges, including one person who assaulted an officer, campus police said. A dozen were issued citations for failing to disperse and follow police commands. They have been released from custody. These protests this week come just one week after the University of Pennsylvania disbanded an encampment on its campus. Hours later that night, hundreds of people were walking through the streets of University City in Philadelphia carrying Palestinian flags. Now, protesters at Drexel University say that they would like to combine with the people who are part of the University of Pennsylvania protest in order to create a bigger footprint. Drexel protesters also want to encourage the university unions to go on strike in solidarity. \"Seeing it finally trickle down from our next-door neighbor to finally here, I hope it is more fruitful - and then more organizations around the area will also step up and also collab,\" Lewis said. Protesters at Drexel say that they plan to stay camped out for as long as possible. These protests now come at a tricky time as final exams begin in about one week for students at the university while many families are already in town for graduation at the University of Pennsylvania on Monday. Students and others have set up tent encampments on campuses around the country to protest the Israel-Hamas war, pressing colleges to cut financial ties with Israel. Tensions over the war have been high on campuses since the fall but the pro-Palestinian demonstrations spread quickly following an April 18 police crackdown on an encampment at Columbia University. The demonstrations reached all corners of the United States, becoming its largest campus protest movement in decades, and spread to other countries, including many in Europe. Nearly 3,000 people have been arrested on U.S. campuses over the past month. As summer break approaches, there have been fewer new arrests and campuses have been calmer. Still, colleges have been vigilant for disruptions to commencement ceremonies.",

On several occasions, a home on the 1000 block of Concord Circle in Haddonfield was targeted with three different vehicle fires as well as another time when a concrete block was thrown through a window of the house over the course of six years, police said. Investigators used digital evidence to determine that Michael McNeely, 42, was the suspect they were looking for, officials said. He was arrested on Friday and now faces several charges including aggravated arson and criminal mischief. The first time police were called to the home was on October 18, 2017, for a car fire, officials said. Police said that the second time they were called to the house was on June 20, 2019, when the window was broken. This was then followed by the third visit by police officers when another car was reportedly on fire on June 25, 2021, officials said. The car fires in 2017 and 2021 are still under investigation. A third vehicle fire was reported on October 21, 2023, at the same home, police said. Surveillance video was able to capture a person who could be seen pouring gasoline onto the car and lighting it on fire. Then, officers with the Medford Township Police Department responded to the unit block of High Point Drive for a report of a bench that had been spray painted and vandalized on November 9, 2023, according to the prosecutor's office. McNeely is also facing charges of harassment and stalking, officials said. He was taken to a correctional facility in Camden County and is currently waiting for a court date.

        "content": "Nineteen protesters, including six students, were taken into police custody Friday night, after attempting to occupy a building on the University of Pennsylvania campus, a university spokesperson said. Seven of the students arrested on Friday remained in custody Saturday awaiting felony charges, including one person who assaulted an officer, campus police said. A dozen were issued citations for failing to disperse and follow police commands. They have been released from custody. Around 9 p.m. pro-Palestinian protesters had hit the streets in University City once again. The activists had blocked the road near 34th and Walnut Streets, and that's when a group of them entered Fisher-Bennet Hall on Penn's campus. \"Twelve were issued citations for failure to disperse and failure to follow police commands and later released. Seven remain in custody awaiting felony charges, including one for assaulting a police officer. \" the spokesperson said in a statement. The spokesperson added that after the building was cleared, Penn Police recovered lock-picking tools and homemade metal shields fashioned from oil drums. The exit doors had been secured with zip-ties, barbed wire, and barricaded with metal chairs and desks, and the windows were covered over with newspaper and cardboard. Bike racks and metal chairs were also found blocking outside entrances.  SkyForce10 was over the scene of the protest, where police could be seen lined up next to the crowd on the sidewalk. Some officers were wearing helmets and carrying batons while some had ziptie handcuffs visible. Some of the protesters could be seen banging pots and pans while others used noisemakers in front of the police officers. Just before 10 p.m., the protesters appeared to rush into the street where the officers were standing. Our cameras caught the moments as the group was chanting, \"We hold power,\" while a woman shouted the chant into a megaphone. Some of the group made a long line from sidewalk to sidewalk with the rest of the protesters gathered behind them while they faced the police officers who were also standing in a line. One person could be seen on the shoulders of another protester while holding up a Palestinian flag. Then, around 10:30, the group of protesters moved to the intersection right outside of Franklin Field at the corner of 33rd and South streets. They gathered on one of the corners of the intersection before crossing to the other side of the street. Meanwhile, an officer stood in the middle of the intersection and directed car traffic to avoid the area of the campus. This protest comes one week after the University of Pennsylvania disbanded an encampment on its campus. Hours later that night, hundreds of people were walking through the streets of University City in Philadelphia carrying Palestinian flags. Students and others have set up tent encampments on campuses around the country to protest the Israel-Hamas war, pressing colleges to cut financial ties with Israel. Tensions over the war have been high on campuses since the fall but the pro-Palestinian demonstrations spread quickly following an April 18 police crackdown on an encampment at Columbia University. The demonstrations reached all corners of the United States, becoming its largest campus protest movement in decades, and spread to other countries, including many in Europe. Nearly 3,000 people have been arrested on U.S. campuses over the past month. As summer break approaches, there have been fewer new arrests and campuses have been calmer.

They say the place is more than just a fitness center, it's a home away from home and their connection to so many friends. One man, Leon Williams, suffered two bouts of throat cancer that took a lot away from him, and now he is losing his fitness center in Vineland, NJ. \"It was something normal for him. He was around people. The instructors are great. Everybody treats him like anyone else,\" his wife Debbie said. The Inspira Health System in Cumberland County owns the fitness center and they recently sent members a letter saying that this location and their smaller Bridgeton and Elmer locations will be closing at the end of June. \"We are emotional about it because we have developed relationships,\" gym member Kathy Trovarelli told NBC10. Judith Augustus has been a member for 13 years. She told NBC10, \"The camaraderie is missing. People come here it's not just about staying physically fit but the emotional part is needed, the connection. Some people have nothing else and no one else.\" In a statement, Inspira says they understand why their members are upset and they say they will be bringing in other local fitness centers to offer services to the soon-to-be displaced members. Some of those members held a rally on Friday, but they say some people were likely scared away by a pretty sizeable showing of Inspira security employees and the fact that the gym was closed today because of the rally. The members are sad but fired up. \"it is disgraceful and it's disgusting,\" Trovarelli said. The group is hoping that Inspira will have a change of heart, or at least rethink their business plan, and keep this gym open. \"When these organizations look at numbers they don't comprehend or want to comprehend the stories behind those numbers,\" yoga teacher Ahmad Graves-El said.",

It's going to be a busy summer for the city with plans over a 13-week span.

It's an ambitious plan with a team of 38 people tasked with finding ways to make Philly cleaner and greener as efforts are expected to ramp up in the next few weeks. “Cleaning every neighborhood, every block at a time by fixing potholes, fixing abandoned property, vacant cars, abandoned autos. We got the people here to do it we’re excited,\" Director of Clean and Green Initiatives Carlton Williams said. For South Philadelphia resident Duncan Lloyd, the effort could be a way for the city to make a good first impression on visitors. \"Obviously summer is a big tourist time for folks to come in to Philadelphia and, like, first impressions go a long way,\" Lloyd said. \"So, if you're not from the city and see a cleaner, more kept up Philadelphia, I think you'll want to come back.\" We're told that city workers will collect trash, sweep streets, fill potholes, fix abandoned properties and deal with illegal dumping. It's a long list of issues that people have been complaining about for decades. Many are now hopeful that they'll finally be addressed.

        "content": "A Pennsylvania school district's decision to remove a song from a recent student choral concert has divided the community and spurred a review by a civil rights group. “ Lift Every Voice And Sing,” a late-19th century hymn sometimes referred to as the Black national anthem, was among several songs that were to be performed during the May 7 show by the Spring Cove Middle School chorus. The Altoona Mirror reported that district officials cut the song the day before the concert, saying students had voiced concerns about the song and the “divisiveness and controversy in the nation.” The district also received several calls from people regarding the song and its inclusion in the concert, officials said. This raised concerns about potential disruptions at the show. School Board President Troy Wright called the decision a “lose-lose situation” and said parents were threatening to pull their children from the concert over the song. “We can’t make everyone happy,” Wright told the newspaper. “We have to do the balancing act between who supports it and who doesn’t support it, and our job is trying to find the balance between it.” The decision to cut the song was made by District Superintendent Betsy Baker and Middle School Principal Amy Miller. Baker said “Lift Every Voice and Sing” was one of many songs selected for the chorus by the music teachers who “picked songs that they felt were appropriate.” Because the chorus practiced other songs, one of those was picked to fill the slot. “We wanted everyone to feel comfortable,” Baker told the newspaper, saying the decision to cut the song was “clearly a divisive issue here\" and stressing that race had nothing to do with the decision. \"There was no right decision, but we focused on letting all of the kids participate in the concert,\" Baker said. Stephen Hershberger, whose son was among the students performing in the chorus concert, was among residents who criticized the decision. “Cutting the song just sends the message that a few individuals’ discomfort outweighs the perspective and care and concern of minority students and others who don’t have the same beliefs as them,” Hershberger told the newspaper. The Blair County NAACP has said it executive board will proceed with a formal investigation into the district's decision, the newspaper reported.",

        "content": "Latinos seeking jobs and affordable housing have transformed Hazleton, Pennsylvania, in recent decades, but a federal lawsuit argues the way representatives are elected to their local school board is unfairly shutting them out of power. Nearly two-thirds of students in the Hazleton Area School District are Hispanic, but no Hispanic person has ever been elected to its school board, prompting the court challenge claiming non-Hispanic white voters have employed the district's “at-large” election system to keep things that way. Two mothers of children enrolled in the anthracite coal region district sued in February, asking for changes to a system they argue dilutes their voting strength and violates the federal Voting Rights Act and the constitutional right to equal protection of the law. The district's 78,000 residents are about 55% white, 40% Hispanic and 5% Black, Asian or multi-racial, according to the lawsuit, with Hispanics concentrated around Hazleton. Hazleton is among several smaller cities in eastern Pennsylvania where Latino populations have grown large enough to have significant impacts on elections, including this year's hotly contested races for president and U.S. Senate. The Hazleton board has shown “a significant lack of responsiveness” to the needs of the district’s Hispanic residents, the plaintiffs argued in the lawsuit. “This includes, but is not limited to, disregard for serious concerns relating to disparate student discipline, student registration procedures founded on unfair stereotypes, inadequate school staffing, lack of qualified translators and lack of effective communication with parents,” according to the lawsuit. The district requires three separate proofs of address to establish residency from those seeking to be registered for school. A bilingual sign to that effect is posted at the entrance to the administration building, with “must have three” underlined and “no exceptions!” added in handwriting. Latino leaders say such proofs can be a challenge to produce for those who are new to the country and may lack stable living arrangements. Some say school translators are overworked and understaffed. And there is a feeling that students without strong English skills can be subject to harsher disciplinary treatment. “We are in an area that is very conservative,” said Vianney Castro, a native of the Dominican Republic and a Democrat who lost November's mayoral election in Hazleton by about 25 percentage points. “They have refused to change. And everything that is happening around us is change.” Tony Bonomo, president of the Hazleton Area School Board, said electing voters by region may be more fair, but he and the other incumbent board members are not likely to initiate such a change. “I do think we’re probably close to having that happen,” said Bonomo, a seven-term Democrat. “You almost have to. When you you have a district that is 60% Latino or whatever, something has to happen.” In seeking dismissal of the case last month, the school district's lawyer argued the two plaintiffs are not entitled to sue under the Voting Rights Act and that voters are divided more by partisan political affiliation than by race and ethnicity. “Plaintiffs fail to allege with any credible specificity that the claimed Hispanic group of voters is politically cohesive or that the White majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually to defeat the minority’s preferred candidate — both assumptions flatly refuted by the reality of the partisan demographics of Hazleton,” the board’s lawyer wrote. The nine members of the all-white school board are elected in the district as a whole, an at-large election system the board adopted in 1989 amid policy disputes over spending. Previously, board members were elected from smaller regions within the district. The Pennsylvania State Education Association says 310 of the state’s 500 school boards, like Hazleton Area, have boards elected entirely at-large, 175 elected from regions within the overall district and 15 using a hybrid system. The Hazleton Area School Board filled vacancies with non-Hispanics twice in recent years, the Hazleton Standard-Speaker reported in February. The Bethlehem Area School District settled a similar federal lawsuit in 2008 prompted by a decision to sidestep two Hispanic candidates and appoint a white man to fill a vacancy. Under that settlement, Bethlehem, about 50 miles from Hazleton, created three geographic seats but continues to elect the other six members at-large. The influx of new residents has long been a topic of conflict in Hazleton. The City Council approved the Illegal Immigration Relief Act in July 2006, seeking to deny business permits to companies that employ people who are living in the country illegally, fine landlords who rent to them and require tenants to register and pay for a rental permit. A federal judge struck down the ordinance. The state's booming Latino population is experiencing growing pains as it works to translate raw numbers in political power, said state Rep. Manny Guzman, a Democrat from Reading and vice chair of the Pennsylvania Legislative Latino Caucus. “We need to do a better job of turning out our voters and building a bench within these respective areas,” Guzman said. The U.S. Justice Department earlier this month filed a document supporting the ability of private plaintiffs, such as the two women who are suing the Hazleton district, to bring such challenges under the 1965 Voting Rights Act.",

        "image": "https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2022/08/FCANCER-license-plate-Delaware.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675",
        "content": "Delaware’s vanity license plate program is unconstitutional because it allows officials to discriminate against certain viewpoints when deciding whether to approve applications, a federal judge has ruled. Tuesday’s ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Kari Lynn Overington, 43, of Milton, a breast cancer survivor whose “FCANCER” license plate was recalled in 2021 because it contained a “perceived profanity.” Overington filed a lawsuit that year challenging the decision, and the American Civil Liberties Union later took up her case. “I’m very grateful that I was able to have my voice heard. What they were doing was wrong,” Overington told The Associated Press on Wednesday. In a deposition last year, Overington testified that when she applied for the vanity plate, she explained that it meant “fight cancer.” DMV officials asked her about Facebook posts showing her wearing a T-shirt reading “f—- cancer\" and celebrating her “f—- cancer” anniversaries, using an expletive and not the word “fight.” A spokesman for the Delaware Department of Transportation said the agency will review the decision before commenting on it and the future of the vanity plate program. A DOT attorney said at a March court hearing that Transportation Secretary Nicole Majeski had talked about getting rid of all vanity plates. Although the lawsuit stemmed from Overington’s feelings about cancer, it exposed how the Division of Motor Vehicles has handled attempts by drivers to express themselves, including those taking aim at President Joe Biden with “Let’s Go Brandon” criticisms. In ruling for Overington, Judge Gregory Williams rejected the DMV's arguments that the alphanumeric combination of letters and numbers on vanity plates constitutes “government speech” and can be regulated as officials see fit. The DMV based its argument on a 2015 Supreme Court ruling allowing Texas to prohibit the Sons of Confederate Veterans from creating a specialty license plate design featuring a Confederate battle flag. Williams noted that the Texas case involved the background art and designs on specialty plates, not the alphanumeric text. Since then, courts in California, Maryland, Rhode Island and Tennessee have ruled that alphanumeric text on vanity plates is private speech, while Hawaii and Indiana courts have said it is government speech. “This court agrees with the majority of courts on this issue,” wrote Williams, declaring that Delaware’s regulations permit viewpoint discrimination and are unconstitutionally overbroad and arbitrarily enforced. Unlike in Delaware, Hawaii’s rules are more defined and objective, simply banning “vulgar” words while including details about which dictionary should be consulted, the judge noted. In Delaware, no vanity plate can be issued if it is “considered to be obscene” by DMV officials. The regulations also state that plates that make “unflattering statements about any particular group or raise politically sensitive issues” should be referred to top administrators for review. DMV records disclosed in the lawsuit illustrate the arbitrary approach officials have taken in denying vanity plates, using terms such as “negative,” “questionable,” “mean,” “evil,” “inappropriate,” “disgusting” and “could be offensive.” In making their decisions, officials frequently relied on the “Urban Dictionary,” a crowd-sourced website that invites people to submit and define slang words and phrases. In one case, officials combined two acronyms found on the site to conclude that “SNDNSNW” did not really mean “sand and snow.” “A lot of them, you really got to scratch your head,” ACLU attorney Dwayne Bensing said Wednesday. “You kind of saw a race to the bottom … as to who could have the most dirty-minded interpretation.” DMV officials have been particularly sensitive about vanity plates with possible sexual innuendo and those aimed at Biden. “Let’s Go Brandon,” and any of its permutations, for example, are off limits. The phrase dates to a crowd chant after a NASCAR race in Alabama in 2021. The crowd chanted “F--- Joe Biden” during a televised interview with race winner Brandon Brown, but an NBC reporter incorrectly said fans were shouting “Let’s go, Brandon.” Although Delaware DMV official Charles Gourley declared “FJOEB” to be “defamation to our current sitting president,” even the name “Brandon” is problematic. A driver wanting “FJBLGB6,” explained that it referred to “kids names,” but DMV official Robyn Bose instead described it as “hate speech and fighting words and vulgar.” Delaware is not the only state where officials are sensitive to vanity plates critical of the president. An Ohio man filed a federal lawsuit earlier this month after his application for a vanity plate reading “F46 LGB” was rejected in 2022. That same year, Alabama officials reversed course and allowed a gun store owner to keep a vanity plate reading “LGBF JB” after initially telling him it would not be renewed.",

        "content": "New Jersey's casinos, horse tracks that accept sports bets and their online partners won more than half a billion dollars from gamblers in April, an increase of 10.4% from a year earlier, state gambling regulators said Thursday. But that was due in large part to the state's second-best month ever for internet gambling. The industry's key business — money won from in-person gamblers — continued to sag, down 6.3% from a year ago. Figures released by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement show the casinos, tracks and their partners won nearly $511 million in April from in-person gambling, internet betting and sports bets. But money from internet and sports bets must be shared with casino partners such as sports books and tech platforms and is not solely for the casinos to keep. For that reason, casinos consider in-person winnings to be their core business. And it's one that continues to struggle. Six of the nine casinos won less from in-person gamblers in April than they did a year earlier. And six of nine casinos also won less in-person money this April than they did in April 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Jane Bokunewicz, director of the Lloyd Levenson Institute at Stockton University, which studies the Atlantic City gambling market, said that while in-person casino winnings are likely to improve in the coming summer months as visitation spikes, Atlantic City may see more of its revenue growth come from non-gambling areas such as food and beverage sales. “It will be many months before a clear picture of this trend is available, but operators’ recent investments in improving resort offerings suggest that a significant shift in the market’s overall revenue mix could be coming,” she said. “A focus beyond gaming, to the elements that make Atlantic City unique and a stronger competitor against the threat of New York City casinos, is simply good business.” In terms of in-person revenue, the Borgata won $58.3 million, up half a percent from a year earlier; Hard Rock won $41.1 million, up 6%; Ocean won $28.8 million, down 15.6% in a month during which part or all of its casino floor was shut down for four days while switching from one computer system to another; Tropicana won $17.7 million, down 9.2%; Harrah's won $16.4 million, down nearly 25%; Caesars won $16 million, down 18.4%; Bally's won $13.1 million, down 4.9%; Golden Nugget won $12.7 million, down 3.1% and Resorts won $12.4 million, virtually flat from a year ago. Including internet and sports betting revenue, Borgata won $107.7 million, down 0.2%; Golden Nugget won nearly $66 million, up 20.4%; Hard Rock won $55.2 million, up 18.6%; Ocean won $35.7 million, down 8.6%; Tropicana won $34.8 million, up nearly 28%; Bally's won $21.5 million, up 5%; Harrah's won $18.3 million, down 16%; Caesars won $16.1 million, down 19.3%; and Resorts won $12.1 million, down nearly 2%. Among internet-only entities, Resorts Digital won $66.4 million, up 7.2%, and Caesars Interactive NJ won $612,910 in a month in which three internet gambling sites switched from the interactive company to Tropicana. Internet gambling had its second-best month in April with nearly $188 million won online, an increase of 18.2% from a year ago. Sports betting brought in over $1 billion in April, with $106 million of that total kept as revenue after paying off winning bets and other expenses. The Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, near New York City, won the lion's share of that at $73.1 million. Resorts Digital won nearly $19 million; Freehold Raceway won $2.2 million, and Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport won $953,798.",

But the U.S. Census Bureau data out this week also shows San Antonio, Texas, could surpass Philadelphia in the coming years if trends continue. The data shows that Philadelphia lost 3.3% of its population — roughly 53,000 residents — between April 2020 and July 2023, dropping the city’s overall population to about 1,550,542. San Antonio, meanwhile, saw the largest numerical increase in its population of any city in the country in 2023, adding about 22,000 residents last year. Its population now stands at 1,495,295, according to census estimates, or about 55,000 people behind Philadelphia. The data also shows Philadelphia is not the only major city to see its population shrink. Nearly all its peer cities in the Northeast and Midwest saw losses, too — some coming at much greater rates. New York City saw a 6.2% decrease in population during the peak pandemic years, while population drops in Boston and Baltimore also outpaced Philly’s decline from 2020 to 2023. Some West Coast cities also shrank more than Philly, including San Francisco, which lost 7.4% of its population, and San Jose, California. On the opposite end, five of the nation's 10 largest cities added population, mostly in the South and Southwest.",

He is an actual joy,” Jack’s teacher, Laura Grabon, said. According to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), “Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a large group of rare genetic disorders that affect the addition of sugar building blocks, called glycans, to proteins in cells throughout the body.”  When a person has CDG, problems occur in how the sugar building blocks are attached to proteins. This affects how cells in every part of the body function which can lead to a wide range of health problems, according to CHOP. How does a child get CDG? According to CHOP it's genetic, so in most cases, it is inherited from parents. If only one copy of a gene’s pair has the mutation the person would not have CDG, the disorder only typically occurs when both parents have the genetic mutation.  Chop says that when a person has CDG there can be many different signs and symptoms including:  Then, as children enter adolescence and grow to adulthood, additional symptoms may include: Despite the difficulties Jack might go through with CDG, his symptoms do not stop him from spending time with friends and learning at school.  He was pretty shy at first, but on this CDG day he had no problem showing off his writing or leading his classmates through a lesson. His classmates are not shy to talk about Jack. \"He's fun and kind,\" one classmate said Another student said, \"he's nice and plays with me.\" Grabon said, “He’s reading on grade level, he's writing his letters and words and he’s beyond proud.” Teaching about differences at this young age benefits everyone, not just for now but in the future too.",

Mark Kelly Tyler, had said the main damage was to the lower-level windows at the church. Tyler told NBC10 that his first thoughts were fears that the attack could be fueled by hate. He was \"relieved\" to learn that it didn't appear the attack was political in nature as past attacks have been. \"It appeared to be the work of just one person,\" Tyler said. \"He probably didn't even recognize what Mother Bethel is, what it means to so many people.\" The damage was about $18,000 thousand, and Tyler said when the community heard the story, they stepped up to help pay for new windows. \"We thought this was going to be an insurance claim and that no one would even know. And it was actually thanks to the media breaking the news, kind of against our wishes, but once it was out there, it went viral in the best possible way and people would not stop giving,\" Tyler said.

        "content": "Sen. Bob Menendez said Thursday that his wife will undergo a mastectomy after she was diagnosed with breast cancer, a revelation made just as the first evidence — pictures of 13 gold bars and over $480,000 in cash seized from the couple's home — was shown to jurors at his New York bribery trial. The New Jersey Democrat said he was revealing his wife's health crisis at her request after repeated inquiries from the media. “We are, of course, concerned about the seriousness and advanced stage of the disease,” the senator said in a statement. He added: “She will require follow up surgery and possibly radiation treatment. We hope and pray for the best results.” Previously, lawyers for Nadine Menendez had requested her trial on charges in the case be delayed after she was diagnosed with what was only previously described publicly as a serious health issue. Judge Sidney H. Stein had postponed her trial until at least July. Nadine Menendez, who married the senator two years after she began dating him in 2018, has pleaded not guilty. One of her lawyers declined comment in response to Bob Menendez's disclosure Thursday. The senator, on trial with two of three businessmen who allegedly paid him bribes, has pleaded not guilty to charges of bribery, fraud, extortion, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent of Egypt. A third businessman has pleaded guilty in the case and will testify against the others. Menendez's statement about his wife was released just after opening statements were completed and the presentation of evidence began at his trial in Manhattan federal court. The trial's first witness was an FBI agent, Aristotelis Kougemitros, who described leading a June 2022 raid on the couple's Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, home. He testified that two 1-kilogram (2.2-pound) gold bars, 11 1-ounce gold bars and $486,461 in cash were among valuables found in the home, along with cellphones and jewelry. In all, 52 items were seized. At first, Kougemitros said, the FBI had directed agents to photograph any cash that was found, but not necessarily to seize it. But he said that based on his experience and training, along with the “totality of the circumstances,” that he decided the amount of cash was so voluminous that it would be seized. “I believed there was evidence potentially of a crime,” he said, drawing an objection from Menendez's lawyer that was sustained by the judge. Through dozens of photographs and the agent's testimony, jurors were taken on a tour of the home as Kougemitros described where cash and the gold bars were discovered by a team of eight agents that was later supplemented by two Manhattan agents who brought cash-counting machines. The gold bars were found in a safe and on the floor nearby inside locked closets in a bedroom, he said. Much of the cash was found stuffed in jacket pockets, in two pairs of boots and on a shelf in the home's basement, he said. One pair of Timberland boots contained $14,500 in cash nearly evenly divided while another set of boots also had cash stuffed in each boot, he said. A black jacket, which was among four jackets found to contain cash, had $21,000 in envelopes in its pockets, Kougemitros said. The other jackets, he added, had $4,300, $6,000 and $8,000. On a shelf nearby, he said, a plastic bag contained $100,000, while another bag held $95,000. Earlier in the day, lawyers for New Jersey real estate developer Fred Daibes and businessman Wael Hana delivered their opening remarks to jurors a day after a prosecutor and Menendez’s lawyer gave opening statements. Attorney Lawrence Lustberg, representing Hana, said prosecutors had built their case against his client on “innocent acts.” He said Hana was longtime friends since 2009 with Nadine Menendez and that Hana and Nadine Menendez had exchanged expensive gifts over the years. He said there was never a time when Hana either directly to Bob Menendez or indirectly through Nadine Menendez gave a bribe in exchange for official acts by the senator. Attorney Cesar De Castro, representing Daibes, told jurors the case was about relationships and prosecutors were trying to exploit facts about a three-decade friendship between the senator and Daibes to claim crimes occurred. He said they will conclude his client was not guilty. On Wednesday, attorney Avi Weitzman, representing Bob Menendez, told jurors his client was unaware that his spouse had accepted gifts from the three businessmen and did not know about cash and gold bars hidden in a closet at their home. The statement came after an opening statement by Assistant U.S. Attorney Lara Pomerantz in which the prosecutor repeatedly highlighted the gold bars and cash found in the home. Menendez has held public office continuously since 1986, serving as a state legislator before 14 years as a U.S. congressman. In 2006, then-Gov. Jon Corzine appointed Menendez to the Senate seat he vacated when he became governor. The trial, which began Monday, is projected to last up to two months. ___ Catalini reported from Trenton, New Jersey.",

        "content": "Hundreds of riders took to the streets in a nearly silent ride -- the smooth, soft sounds of spoked wheels spinning across concrete was nearly inaudible -- as bicyclists in Philadelphia joined riders across the country for a \"Ride of Silence\" to remember cyclist who died on the road. On the city's streets, riders rode in memory of the 14 bicyclist throughout the Delaware Valley who died over the past year. Organizers of the night's event said that total ties for the highest number of deaths recorded in the area in the past 20 years. In fact, according to the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia, hit-and-run deaths in the city reached an all-time high last year. In 2022, the group found the city saw 34 such incidents. According to numbers from the Philadelphia Police Department, last year, the city saw 39 deadly hit-and-run crashes. On Wednesday night, outside City Hall, riders read the names of bike riders who died in crashes, in order to help remember their loss. Names like Billy McWilliams, who was just 16-years-old when he was killed during a hit and run incident in Northeast Philadelphia last summer. And, Mario D'Adamo III, a 37-year-old attorney from South Philadelphia who was also killed during a hit-and-run incident while riding his bike in the bike lane at FDR Park last August. In March, Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker signed an executive order in the hopes of reaching the goal of no traffic deaths in the city. It supports the effort called Vision Zero Philadelphia that is aimed at improving traffic safety on city streets. \"You should be able to ride safely wherever you go in the area and of course as cyclists you have responsibility to also respect other people as well,\" said Ray Scheinfeld, of the Philadelphia's Ride of Silence.",

        "content": "American sports may have seen its most epic battle of the year: a single raccoon vs. a team of men trying to capture it with trash cans. The stripy tailed interloper stopped play for almost two minutes in the Major League Soccer game between Philadelphia Union and New York City on Wednesday night, prompting a battle of wit and skill with staff on the field of Subaru Park in Chester, PA.   “We need to find him a ball because he’s moving very well in the center of midfield,” said Callum Williams, the commentator on Apple TV. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything quite as bizarre as this, particularly given the amount of time he’s remained on the field” he added. A stadium official approached the urban scavenger with the most appropriate of impromptu capture devices — a trash can — but the creature was too quick and got got away. Having run the almost the full length of the field in its bid for freedom, a second member of staff then attempted to stop the furry fugitive, before a third man armed with yet another trash can finally managed to capture it. By this point the match commentators were rooting for the raccoon. “This is marvelous entertainment. Go on, raccoon! You can get away,” Williams said, before adding “Don’t hurt him!” as the plastic prison was at last put into place. Dubbed “Raquinho” by some, it now holds the not particularly well-contested record of spending the most amount of minutes of any raccoon on the field in MLS history, the league said. Fans speculated which team would be first to sign the raccoon, given its impressive footwork and acceleration. One YouTube commentator argued that it had already shown more promise than any Manchester United attacker this season. The raccoon was picked up by a local pest control company and released back into the wild, Philadelphia Union said in a statement on X. Fans speculated which team would be first to sign the raccoon, given its impressive footwork and acceleration, with one YouTube commentator arguing that it had already shown more promise than any Manchester United attacker this season. The raccoon's appearance was not a good omen for the home team: Philadelphia lost the game 2-1, leaving the team in ninth place in the MLS table after 12 games.

        "content": "A former GOP candidate for Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor -- who was also involved in a political action committee that claimed liberals were “indoctrinating” students -- will serve a year of probation after pleading no contest to giving alcohol to teenagers while hosting her daughter's birthday party in Bucks County. On Wednesday, May 15, 2024, Clarice Schillinger, 37, pleaded no contest to providing alcohol to minors during her daughter's birthday party back in September of last year. No contest means Schillinger neither admitted to nor disputed the charge. She will receive 12 months of probation. Charges of harassment and simple assault that stemmed from allegations that Schillinger also punched a teenager at the party were withdrawn. “I’d like first to thank my children, my family and friends, my attorney, and all of the incredible members of the community who have stood by me and showed unwavering support. In the blink of an eye, my life changed, along with the lives of my children. A series of false allegations drawn out in the media have cost me almost everything. No family should ever go through this,\" Schillinger wrote in a statement on Wednesday. Schillinger's legal counsel Brian McGonagle also provided a statement. “September 2023 found Clarice Schillinger caught in the crosshairs, facing several unwarranted charges that led to her becoming the subject of crippling negative media attention,\" he wrote. \"While it’s unknown what caused the spread of misinformation, an onslaught of clickbait headlines ultimately caused Clarice to lose the life she once knew. She lost her livelihood, received death threats, and had to move from her home to protect her children’s privacy and wellbeing.\" The investigation began on Sept. 30, 2023, shortly after 3 a.m. when police responded to a reported assault at a home that Schillinger was renting on Liz Circle in Doylestown, Pennsylvania.  Responding officers spoke with the 911 caller and her 16-year-old son. The mother, son and other witnesses told investigators Schillinger had hosted a birthday party on Sept. 29, around 9:30 p.m. for her teen daughter at the home and approximately 15 to 20 teens attended, according to the criminal complaint.  Schillinger told the teens to stay in the basement of the home which was stocked with alcoholic beverages in a bar area, police said. Schillinger allegedly poured shots for the teens and drank with them, even playing drinking games.  The witnesses said an argument occurred during the early morning hours of Sept. 30 between a group of drunk adults at the home that caused the teens to want to leave. During the argument, Schillinger’s boyfriend, Shan Wilson, allegedly punched a 15-year-old teen in the face. Schillinger then took Wilson to the second floor of the home, investigators said.  Wilson then attacked a 16-year-old boy, investigators said. Schillinger’s mother, Danette Bert, who was intoxicated, also punched the boy in the eye, according to the criminal complaint.  As other teens at the party started to leave, Bert allegedly chased the teen boy in the kitchen before attacking a 17-year-old girl. Police said the attack was captured on cellphone videos.  Schillinger was also accused of punching another teen boy in the face though those charges were later withdrawn. Police had also responded to the same home nearly a week prior on Sept. 24, 2023, for a report of underage drinking. During that incident, Schillinger was allegedly intoxicated and uncooperative with police who noticed multiple beer cans around the property and about 20 teens that fled into the house, according to the criminal complaint.  Schillinger was arrested and charged on Oct. 26, 2023. Wilson and Bert were also arrested and pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, according to court records. Schillinger was a Republican candidate for Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor in 2022 before losing the GOP primary. Schillinger was also executive director of Back to School PA, a federal PAC that aimed to combat “liberal teachers’ unions and special interest groups that are responsible for indoctrinating our children,” according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.  \"Today, almost a year later, my case has been resolved,\" Schillinger wrote on Wednesday. \"Finally, we can breathe and focus on rebuilding our lives. With forgiveness in my heart and determination propelling me forward, I embrace the opportunity to rise from adversity and contribute positively to the world. Onward and upward, I march, steadfast in my commitment to serve those in need and to foster healing and hope in our community.” McGonagle also wrote on Wednesday that they were celebrating the \"small wins.\" \"Clarice has finally restored her good name and is ready to look forward. While she wouldn't wish this situation on anyone, this ordeal has given her a new perspective on life, family, community, and what truly matters. Clarice is a loving mother, devoted daughter, and loyal friend to many. I know Clarice will use this experience to heal, forgive, and continue to serve and be an advocate for others,\" he wrote. \"With the case behind her, Ms. Schillinger is eager to share her experience to help educate and protect other Pennsylvania moms and continue her support of Pennsylvania youth and schools.\"",

She was so tiny that she needed a paper plate instead of a cone to keep her from getting to her staples. But she made it through,\" the shelter said in a Facebook post. Roo healed up while in foster care and now loves nothing more than to jump onto furniture and run up and down the stairs, according to the shelter. The shelter said Roo's adoptive family found her by \"serendipity.\" Her new owner said she had recently lost her own cat and she dreamt about Roo after hearing her story. \"Upon meeting Roo for the first time, Roo immediately curled up in the adopter's arms the same way her previous cat used to, went to sleep, and was reluctant to be taken away from her. It was as though Roo chose her new home and when she was finally cleared medically to go to her forever home, we knew she already had her place picked out,\" the shelter said.

        "content": "The start date of the trial for the sexual assault case involving Carter Hart and four other players from the 2018 Canadian world junior team could come out in about a month. When the case appears in court June 11, the trial start date is anticipated to be scheduled, a spokesperson for the Ontario superior court confirmed Wednesday to NBC Sports Philadelphia. As reported in April, it does not appear that the trial will begin until after the 2024-25 NHL season is underway. The Flyers open training camp in September and the regular season in October. Hart has been away from the team since Jan. 23, when he requested and was granted an indefinite leave of absence. On Feb. 5, London, Ontario police announced it had charged Hart, the Flames' Dillon Dube, the Devils' Cal Foote and Michael McLeod and former NHLer Alex Formenton with sexual assault, stemming from a June 2018 incident. A week after the goaltender left the Flyers, Hart's legal representation stated that \"he is innocent and will provide a full response to this false allegation in the proper forum, a court of law.\" At Danny Briere's end-of-the-season press conference April 19, the general manager did not have any update on Hart's status. The Flyers plan to go into camp with Samuel Ersson and Ivan Fedotov forming their goaltending tandem. Hart, who turns 26 years old in August, will be a restricted free agent this offseason. He was on the final year of a three-year, $11.937 million contract. In June, the Flyers can extend him a qualifying offer to retain his rights.

        "content": "Philadelphia police are searching for a suspect and a person of interest after two men were arrested in connection to an attack on an off-duty officer who was robbed of his weapon and struck by a car following an argument and fight over the weekend, investigators said. Police identified 38-year-old Arthur Jones as a suspect in the attack. He stands 5-foot-6 and weighs 180 pounds, police said. He is considered armed and dangerous. Philadelphia police are also searching for a woman who they want to question about the incident. Police released surveillance photos of the woman where she can be seen wearing a gray sweatsuit with gray furry boots. She was carrying a pink purse. If you have any information on the whereabouts of Jones or the woman, please call Philadelphia Police at 215-686-TIPS. Prior to releasing the photos of the suspect and person of interest Tuesday night, police had announced two arrests in connection to the incident. Investigators said a 42-year-old officer with the 22nd District had finished an overnight shift and left police headquarters early Sunday morning. The officer was in plainclothes and driving home along the 2100 block of Oxford Street shortly after 7 a.m. when he spotted a crowd and a black BMW blocking the intersection. Officials say the off-duty officer waited about four minutes and through multiple red lights but the vehicle and crowd remained in the street. The officer then honked his horn and a woman in the crowd began arguing with him, police said. Another man, who police said went by the name \"Duke,\" then began arguing with the officer, investigators said. “Duke” then struck the officer in his face multiple times, according to police. The officer then got out of the car and identified himself as a police officer, investigators said. “Duke” then pulled out a gun and held it down to his side, according to police. Police said a struggle then ensued between \"Duke\" and the officer. Another man, later identified as 24-year-old Yusef Coleman, then approached the officer from behind and placed him in a headlock, investigators said. Coleman was armed and the officer struggled with him over the gun, according to police. The officer managed to push the weapon away and the magazine fell out of Coleman's gun, investigators said. The officer then pulled the trigger and fired the remaining round, according to police. \"The firearm that he's struggling over, he has a hand on it. The offender has a hand on it. At some point he's able to get the magazine dislodged. It was an extended magazine,\" Philadelphia Police Deputy Commissioner Frank Vanore said. \"But the officer, due to his training, knows that there's another round in the chamber.\" \"Duke\" then pointed a gun at the officer and demanded he release the weapon, police said. At the same time, a nearby after-hours bar had just closed and a crowd of about a dozen people arrived at the scene. Investigators said the off-duty officer was then beaten by multiple people and his personal weapon was stolen from his holster. A responding on-duty officer then arrived at the scene, causing the crowd to disperse and both \"Duke\" and Coleman to flee, police said. Coleman went into the black BMW and drove off, striking the off-duty officer's leg in the process, according to investigators. The off-duty officer was taken to the hospital and treated for a concussion, multiple injuries to his face and bruising, police said. Detectives looked at the officer’s body camera footage as well as surveillance video from the area. Investigators recognized Coleman and police determined an area they say he normally frequented. Sunday afternoon, Coleman as well as the black BMW were found on G and Hilton streets. Coleman was taken into custody and the vehicle was recovered. Coleman has been charged with criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault, assault of a law enforcement officer, robbery, theft by unlawful taking, weapon violations, and related offenses. Later on Sunday, three women who investigators said were involved in the incident, arrived at 22nd District police headquarters and spoke with police. No charges have been filed against them though it’s unknown at this time if they will eventually face any charges. On Tuesday, police announced that \"Duke\" was also arrested. They have not yet revealed his full name or the charges he faces. Police also said they recovered the off-duty officer's stolen gun.",

        "image": "https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/sextortion-case.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675",
        "content": "It's a crime that police say often embarrasses the victim and those behind internet sextortion count on that embarrassment in order to get what they want. But, when the victims speak up the cases can lead investigators to more victims. Sextortion is against the law in Pennsylvania and police often suspect the cases go unreported because of the embarrassment it can cause. Police say that Antonio Nieves of Birdsboro, Berks County, has been arrested and charged for alleged sextortion. Internet data pinpointed activity from an anonymous Instagram account. \"You're never anonymous online. There's always some way to trace it back,\" Bensalem Police Sgt. Glenn Vandegrift said. A woman went to the police to figure out where harassing posts were coming from and the man they say was behind them. \"A female victim reported it. She was receiving messages threatening that they were going to post nude photographs of her online if she didn't provide more nude photographs. She said that the Instagram account was from an anonymous user and she also had some information that she received over Snapchat,\" Vandegrift said. Police say that the person behind the account harassed the victim but she was unable to determine who was sending the messages. \"Just because you create an account and you don't tie your name to it doesn't mean you're not going to get caught,\" Vandegrift warns. Police say the accounts were eventually traced back to Antonio Nieves and according to court documents he made admissions to police as to what he had done. Investigators say Nieves knew the victim and had images of her from when she was a teenager. It's one reason why police are warning everyone to never exchange intimate photos with anyone because they can be altered and used against you. And, if you ever get these harassing messages, even from an account you can't put a name to, don't let the embarrassment or fear keep you from reporting it. Nieves is charged in this case and was released on $60,000 unsecured bail. When NBC10 went to the home listed on court documents for Nieves, no one answered the door. Police give credit to the victim in the case and urge any others to come forward. \"Please report this because you're a victim in these cases and there could be numerous other victims out there,\" Vandegrift explained. Police say that often people are contacted through social media or even gaming websites. Sometimes, victims think that if they provide the images no one will know, but they say that opens the door for victims to be used over and over again. Once the images are out there, officials say they can then be used by others. If you know anything about this or other cases involving internet sextortion, call police.",

From his New Heights podcast -- which he does with his, somewhat well-known brother Travis -- to his charity work with the Eagles Autism Foundation and founding the nonprofit (Be) Philly Foundation, Kelce can be seen all over the place. And now, his bearded mug can be seen emblazoned against a Dunkin' shop, located along the 900 block of West Chester Pike in Havertown. The mural featuring Kelce was unveiled on Monday and is intended to celebrate his recent retirement from football. During the unveiling ceremony, Dunkin' delivered a check for $13,000 to the (Be)Philly Foundation -- founded by Kelce -- that is focused on providing financial support and increased visibility to evidenced-based organizations that work to improve the mental, physical, and environmental health and well-being of Philadelphia Public School students. The work was produced by Philadelphia-based artist Glossback, who said in a statement that he wanted to create a mural on his neighborhood Dunkin' as a \"thank you\" for Kelce's 13-year career as a Philadelphia Eagle. In a statement, Dunkin' representatives said they hope the mural serves as a way to recognize Kelce's continuous work for the Greater Philadelphia area both on and off the field.",

        "image": "https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/AP24134663335200.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=320%2C180",
        "content": "Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko said the long delay by the U.S. Congress in approving military aid for his country was “a colossal waste of time,” allowing Russian President Vladimir Putin to inflict more suffering in the 2-year-old invasion and prolonging the war. The severe lack of ammunition, which forced outgunned Ukrainian forces to surrender village after village on the front lines, also sowed concern among Ukraine’s other Western allies about Kyiv's prospects in repelling the Russian invasion, Yushchenko told The Associated Press in an interview Monday. That sent a signal to Putin to “attack, ruin infrastructure, rampage all over Ukraine,” said Yushchenko, a pro-European reformer who sought to distance Kyiv from Moscow during his 2005-2010 administration. “And, of course, this undermines the morale of those in the world who stand with and support Ukraine,” said Yushchenko, who was in Philadelphia to speak at a World Affairs Council event. The delay “is not fatal” to Ukraine, but it forced Ukraine's war planners to revise the current year's campaign, he said. Yushchenko has backed the handling of the war by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and has asserted that no Ukrainian politician would give up territory in order to end the war. Yushchenko said it would be a “big mistake” for the U.S. and Europe to expect such a deal for peace, and would only embolden Putin to attack again. It would, he said, “give Putin five or seven years to get stronger and then start this misery again.” On the battlefield, Russia is pushing ahead with a ground offensive that opened a new front in eastern Ukraine's Kharkiv region and put pressure on overstretched Ukrainian forces. Yushchenko urged Western allies to make political decisions faster to aid Ukraine in a fight that soldiers are waging every day around the clock. “The front line is working 24 hours, it doesn’t take vacation,\" he said. After the U.S. aid was approved last month, President Joe Biden said he was immediately rushing badly needed weaponry to Ukraine as he signed into law a $61 billion war aid measure for Ukraine. Without it, CIA Director Bill Burns has said, Ukraine could lose the war to Russia by the end of this year. Still, only small batches of U.S. military aid have started to trickle into the front line, according to Ukrainian military commanders, who said it will take at least two months before supplies meet Kyiv’s needs to hold the line. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday that the Biden administration was “trying to really accelerate the tempo” of U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine following the monthslong delay by Congress. “The level of intensity being exhibited right now in terms of moving stuff is at a 10 out of 10,” he said. The U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken, arrived in Kyiv on Tuesday in an unannounced diplomatic mission to reassure Ukraine that it has American support. Biden and Ukraine's allies in Congress pushed for months to overcome resistance from hard-right Republican lawmakers in the House over renewed American support for repelling Russia’s invasion. Final action only came after Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson pushed past that opposition last month to bring Ukraine aid to a vote. The funding impasse dated back to August, when Biden made his first emergency spending request for Ukraine. Since Russia’s February 2022 invasion, the U.S. has sent more than $44 billion worth of weapons, maintenance, training and spare parts to Ukraine. Yushchenko acknowledged the huge losses that Ukraine has suffered in over two years of war, costing lives every day and forcing regular Ukrainians to join the fight. But he said that he was ashamed to hear arguments about “war fatigue” and that it shouldn't be an excuse to stop fighting. “Every day we pay with our lives,” Yushchenko said. “The lives of children and women, the lives of Ukrainian soldiers. Our infrastructure is being destroyed every day.” Despite his harsh criticism of the U.S. delay in approving the latest military aid, Yushchenko acknowledged that Ukraine has been able to recapture a significant part of the occupied territory thanks to Western support. More gains can be achieved if the allies are united, Yushchenko said. “For Putin, the main geopolitical challenge is freedom and democracy. And today he is using all available resources to show that the Western world is weak” and unable to coalesce, Yushchenko said. He has said he believes victory for Ukraine is inevitable, given the sacrifice of the country's citizens to fight, and sees the war as a larger, defining battle to defend democracy from tyranny and imperialism. Yushchenko came to power as a popular opposition leader in the 2004 Orange Revolution protests, beating Putin’s preferred candidate. As president he adamantly pushed to move Ukraine out of Moscow’s shadow and integrate more closely with Western Europe. But his presidency was marked by political skirmishing that paralyzed government and prevented any of his promised reforms from being passed. He lost power amid a plunging Ukrainian economy during the 2008 global financial crisis and tensions with Russia highlighted by a clash over gas prices. Yushchenko survived a dioxin poisoning during his 2004 election campaign, and several former Russian intelligence officers accused Moscow of being behind the poisoning. The poisoning forced Yushchenko to temporarily abandon campaign activities in the midst of Ukraine’s hotly contested presidential race, and severely disfigured his face. But it also earned him the sympathy of many Ukrainians. He has said he subsequently underwent more than two dozen surgeries. Arhirova reported from Kyiv, Ukraine. Associated Press writer Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, contributed to this report.",

        "content": "After a heated meeting with the community on Monday night, the board of the Pennridge School District has voted to approve a policy that will provide students -- no matter their gender identity -- with bathrooms that can accommodate them. With a vote of 5-to-4, the board ruled to reverse a policy that required students to use the bathroom of their biological sex. And, starting in August, the school district will provide separate bathrooms for students and faculty use depending on gender identity. The bathrooms will be labeled as: faculty use, bathrooms for biological males, bathrooms for biological females, bathrooms for those who identify as male as well as bathrooms for those who identify as female. There will also be single use bathrooms that can be used by students no matter how they identify. In a meeting on Monday night, a graduate of the district, who said they identify as non-binary, argued the change was needed to permit others like them from being harassed at school. \"I'm worried about being harassed. Like, I just want to use the bathroom,\" they said. \"I don't want people to pay attention to me, but, I have to worry about that.\" Yet, the change was met with vitriol from some in attendance. \"We don't like this. It looks like you're playing politics with our kids,\" said a father of a student in the district. One mother of a student in the district, who spoke to the board, said the district was taking parenting decisions away from parents. \"With this policy, you're now trying to dictate how you are going to act as parents to our children against our will,\" she said. \"You are not medical or mental health professionals. You are also not complying with the majority desires of parents in the community who have given you ample reasons to keep the current policy.\" The move comes after President Joe Biden's administration overhauled Title 9 in April which found the previous bathroom policy to be considered discriminatory and a violation of Title 9. Those new regulations go into effect Aug. 1.",

        "content": "The Philadelphia Soul's return to Arena Football League was short-lived, but team leadership is promising the Soul will live on. A post on the X social media platform on Friday, May 10, announced that the Philadelphia Soul was \"taking a pause\" for the rest of the 2024 AFL season. \"We look forward to bringing Soul football back for all of #SoulNation next year,\" the post on the team's verified X page said. Just days earlier, the Soul's X page promoted the Soul's Sunday, May 12, 2024, road game against the Nashville Kats. The Kats wound up hosting the Salina Liberty instead, falling 50-30, according to the Kats' social media. That kind of hodgepodge game is unfortunately fairly typical during the reboot of the AFL, as pointed out by Pro Football Talk's Mike Florio. The Iowa Rampage and Georgia Force had already folded and the AFL has no had games broadcast on NFL Network as was first announced. The Soul (well sort of them since they used mostly replacement players for their opener on the road against the Louisiana Voodoo) went 0-2 before folding. The team's last game on Sunday, May 5, on the road against the Minnesota Myth wasn't even streamed, \"due to technical difficulties,\" according to the team. The team's website, PhiladelphiaSoulFB.com, was down by Monday, May 13, 2024. It was a far cry from the Jon Bon Jovi-owned and Ron Jaworski-owned Soul teams that won three arena league titles while playing most home games in the Wells Fargo Center. The 2024 Soul was set to play its home games at Trenton's CURE Insurance Arena, but the Soul never took the field for a home game. Tickets that were previously on sale for games scheduled for May 26, June 23 and June 30. Logan on Friday didn't immediately know how ticket refunds would be handled. Soul GM Kelly Logan joined the Take the 8 Count podcast to discuss what led to ending the 2024 season. \"unfortunately guys we just don't have the money,\" Logan said he told the players. Logan said that the players had already lost housing and that some of the Soul players who stuck around were disheartened. Logan mentioned players being kicked out of the Super 8 motel in New Jersey as foreshadowing what was to come. Logan said only three players made the trip to the Voodoo game. Logan said he didn't even get jerseys for the players until they showed up for the Louisiana game, representing that game a tryout for the players who filled in. Will the Soul be back? “My goal is to come back [to the AFL] next year, or be somewhere, with the name of Philadelphia Soul,\" Logan said. \"I just want to tell the fans that I do appreciate you guys, I really did my best,\" Logan said. Will that happen? Time will tell.",

        "content": "Editor's Note: May 15, 12:44 a.m.: A previous version of this article incorrectly identified a wanted suspect in the attack as one of the suspects in custody. The article has been corrected and new details on the investigation can be found here. Philadelphia police are searching for another suspect and a person of interest after an off-duty officer was attacked, robbed of his weapon and struck by a car following an argument and fight over the weekend, according to investigators. Two men have been taken into custody but officials are looking for a woman and another male suspect. Police identified 38-year-old Arthur Jones as a suspect in the attack. He stands 5-foot-6 and weighs 180 pounds, police said. He is considered armed and dangerous. A woman is also wanted by police for questioning about the incident. Police released surveillance photos of the woman where she can be seen wearing a gray sweatsuit with gray furry boots. She was carrying a pink purse. Investigators said a 42-year-old officer with the 22nd District had finished an overnight shift and left police headquarters early Sunday morning. The officer was in plainclothes and driving home along the 2100 block of Oxford Street shortly after 7 a.m. when he spotted a crowd and a black BMW blocking the intersection. Officials say the off-duty officer waited about four minutes and through multiple red lights but the vehicle and crowd remained in the street. The officer then honked his horn and a woman in the crowd began arguing with him, police said. Another man, who police said went by the name \"Duke,\" then began arguing with the officer, investigators said. “Duke” then struck the officer in his face multiple times, according to police. The officer then got out of the car and identified himself as a police officer, investigators said. “Duke” then pulled out a gun and held it down to his side, according to police. Police said a struggle then ensued between \"Duke\" and the officer. Another man, later identified as 24-year-old Yusef Coleman, then approached the officer from behind and placed him in a headlock, investigators said. Coleman was armed and the officer struggled with him over the gun, according to police. The officer managed to push the weapon away and the magazine fell out of Coleman's gun, investigators said. The officer then pulled the trigger and fired the remaining round, according to police. \"The firearm that he's struggling over, he has a hand on it. The offender has a hand on it. At some point he's able to get the magazine dislodged. It was an extended magazine,\" Philadelphia Police Deputy Commissioner Frank Vanore said. \"But the officer, due to his training, knows that there's another round in the chamber.\" \"Duke\" then pointed a gun at the officer and demanded he release the weapon, police said. At the same time, a nearby after-hours bar had just closed and a crowd of about a dozen people arrived at the scene. Investigators said the off-duty officer was then beaten by multiple people and his personal weapon was stolen from his holster. A responding on-duty officer then arrived at the scene, causing the crowd to disperse and both \"Duke\" and Coleman to flee, police said. Coleman went into the black BMW and drove off, striking the off-duty officer's leg in the process, according to investigators. The off-duty officer was taken to the hospital and treated for a concussion, multiple injuries to his face and bruising, police said. Detectives looked at the officer’s body camera footage as well as surveillance video from the area. Investigators recognized Coleman and police determined an area they say he normally frequented. Sunday afternoon, Coleman as well as the black BMW were found on G and Hilton streets. Coleman was taken into custody and the vehicle was recovered. Coleman has been charged with criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault, assault of a law enforcement officer, robbery, theft by unlawful taking, weapon violations, and related offenses. Later on Sunday, three women who investigators said were involved in the incident, arrived at 22nd District police headquarters and spoke with police. No charges have been filed against them though it’s unknown at this time if they will eventually face any charges. On Tuesday, police announced that \"Duke\" was also arrested. They have not yet revealed his full name or the charges he faces. Police also said they recovered the off-duty officer's stolen gun.",

        "content": "Punxsutawney Phil's offspring now have names that just might help the famed weather-forecasting groundhog to predict when spring will begin. Phil's human handlers chose Mother's Day to announce that the two kits born this spring to Phil and his partner, Phyllis, are named Sunny and Shadow. Sunny is a female, Shadow a male. Each spring, Phil makes a prediction about the length of the remaining winter. According to tradition, if he sees his shadow there will be six more weeks of cold. This year, Phil did not see his shadow and therefore predicted an early spring. “These kits of his are not replacements, they're not the heir apparent,” Dan McGinley, vice president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club Inner Circle, said in a phone interview Monday. “Sunny and Shadow will not be part of the ceremony — it's still Phil's job. There's still only one Punxsutawney Phil.” The club received hundreds of suggestions for the pups' names. The final decision emerged after a one-on-one between Phil and the club's president, Tom Dunkel. “Today the first family of groundhogs has grown, Punxsutawney Phil and wife Phyllis have two kits of their own,” McGinley read from a scroll announcing the names of the pups “born to royalty” in a video posted on social media on Sunday. The babies were discovered in March by a club member who was feeding fruit and vegetables to Phil and Phyllis. The groundhog family lives in a climate-controlled burrow at the local library.",

        "content": "Childish Gambino, a.k.a. Donald Glover, is headed out on tour this summer -- for possibly the last time, as Glover has said he plans to retire the alter ego after a final album set to release this summer -- and he is expected to stop at Wells Fargo Center on August 21. On Monday, Glover announced the The New World Tour as he surprised fans with the release of Atavista -- which is a reimagined version of his 3.15.20 album. The album includes two new tracks: “Atavista'' and “Human Sacrifice.\" Additionally, he also unveiled an official music video for “Little Foot Big Foot,” directed by Hiro Murai, featuring Young Nudy. Gambino is also expected to release his new album -- a soundtrack to the upcoming film, Bando Stone and the New World -- this summer. Glover has said in the past that he plans to retire the Childish Gambino moniker after that album drops. The U.S. leg of Childish Gambino's New World Tour will kick off on Aug. 11 at the Paycom Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and will stop at Philadelphia’s Wells Fargo Center on Aug. 21. Organizers said that Gambino will then begin the European/UK and Australian/New Zealand legs of The New World Tour in Lyon, FR, on October 31 before concluding at RAC Arena in Perth, WA on February 11.

        "image": "https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/menendez-trial.png?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all",
        "content": "Sen Bob Menendez, a Democrat, went on trial in Manhattan federal court Monday, accused of accepting bribes of gold and cash to use his influence to deliver favors that would help three New Jersey businessmen. Menendez, 70, sat with his lawyers and listened as Judge Sidney H. Stein told two separate groups of 50 prospective jurors about the charges against Menendez and two of the businessmen. The judge told them the “sitting U.S. senator from the state of New Jersey” had been charged in a conspiracy in which he allegedly “agreed to accept bribes and accepted bribes.” After he warned them that the trial was expected to last up to seven weeks (to which there were audible groans in the courtroom), Stein let jurors raise their hands if they believed they could not serve for that length of time. Then, he took them one at a time into a separate room to ask them why. Menendez is on trial with two of the businessmen who allegedly paid him bribes — real estate developer Fred Daibes and Wael Hana. All three have pleaded not guilty. A third businessman has pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against the other defendants. The senator's wife is also charged, but her trial is delayed until at least July. Stein had not finished questioning prospective jurors who said they could not serve when he finished for the day without yet beginning the process of asking general questions of all jurors, such as whether they know any of the parties to the case, including lawyers, the defendants and possible witnesses. The judge gave no indication whether he thought it was likely that openings would occur Tuesday. When Menendez left the courthouse at the end of the day, he gave a friendly wave toward reporters who asked him to speak as he walked quickly to a waiting car, but he left any meaningful comment for another day. In the morning, Menendez, wearing a suit with a red tie, was dropped off in front of the federal courthouse at 8:15 a.m., forty minutes before former President Donald Trump's motorcade passed by on its way across the street to state court, where he is on trial for allegedly falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to a porn actor before the 2016 election. He did not speak to reporters who were kept behind barricades as he entered a security pavilion where everyone entering the courthouse is scanned. The trial, the second in seven years for Menendez, has already sent the senator's political stature tumbling. After charges were announced in September, he was forced out of his powerful post as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The three-term senator has announced he will not be seeking reelection on the Democratic ticket this fall, although he has not ruled out running as an independent. The previous prosecution on unrelated charges against him ended with a deadlocked jury in 2017. In the new case, prosecutors say the senator's efforts on behalf of the businessmen led him to take actions benefitting the governments of Egypt and Qatar. Menendez has vigorously denied doing anything unusual in his dealings with foreign officials. Besides charges including bribery, extortion, fraud and obstruction of justice, Menendez also is charged with acting as a foreign agent of Egypt. Among evidence his lawyers will have to explain are gold bars worth over $100,000 and more than $486,000 in cash found in a raid two years ago on his New Jersey home, including money stuffed in the pockets of clothing in closets. The Democrat's wife, Nadine Menendez, was also charged in the case, but her trial has been postponed for health reasons. She is still expected to be a major figure. Prosecutors say Nadine Menendez often served as a conduit between the men paying the bribes and Menendez. The senator's lawyers in court papers have said they plan to explain that Menendez had no knowledge of some of what occurred because she kept him in the dark. According to an indictment, Daibes delivered gold bars and cash to Menendez and his wife to get the senator's help with a multimillion-dollar deal with a Qatari investment fund, prompting Menendez to act in ways favorable to Qatar's government. The indictment also said Menendez did things benefitting Egyptian officials in exchange for bribes from Hana as the businessman secured a valuable deal with the Egyptian government to certify that imported meat met Islamic dietary requirements. In pleading guilty several weeks ago, businessman Jose Uribe admitted buying Menendez's wife a Mercedes-Benz to get the senator's help to influence criminal investigations involving his business associates.

Police detailed surveillance video shared by a local business, saying it showed \"a male with long hair being punched and kicked several times.\" The organizers of the event, Goodtime Amusements, based in Hellertown, said the carnival was cancelled \"indefinitely\" because of \"out of control behavior and the unrest that transpired.\" \"This is the first time I've had permits revoked in 37 years of operation,\" Jefrey Good with Good Time Amusements said. \"This past weekend, an incident involving a large group of teenagers disrupted the carnival at Exton Square, which necessitated intervention to ensure the safety of all patrons and community members. As a result of this, local authorities made the decision to close the carnival for the remainder of the event - a decision that was not made lightly, but that prioritized the security of our guests, employees, and the community,\" a statement from PREIT about the carnival at Exton Square said. Officials said that there were several witnesses to the incident and police are still working to identify the assailants, the victim and locate other witnesses. \"We just have a societal issue with youth doing as they please I suppose. Everybody sees it,\" Good said.

        "content": "Police in Delaware are investigating after a teen boy was killed and another critically injured in a shooting outside of the Concord Mall in Wilmington, Delaware, on Saturday night. According to the Delaware State Police, on Saturday, May 11, 2024, at about 10:45 p.m., troopers responded after a shooting in the parking lot of the Concord Mall, along the 4700 block of Concord Pike, in Wilmington, to find two teenagers that had been shot. Officials said that troopers began life-saving efforts on both boys and they were immediately transported to nearby hospitals. However, despite the efforts of first responders, officials said a 16-year-old boy -- who police provided no further identifying details on -- was pronounced at the hospital, while the other, a 17-year-old boy, was placed in \"serious\" condition, according to law enforcement officials. According to the state police, an investigation into the incident found that a fight is believed to have broken out at the entrance to the L.E.A.D.

Fest Carnival posted a flyer on its social media stating that the carnival would be closed Sunday night due to the weather and giving their condolences.

        "content": "Editor's Note (May 16, 2024, 6:12 a.m.): Gov. Josh Shapiro signed the \"tranq\" bill on May 15. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro will sign legislation to criminalize the misuse of a powerful animal tranquilizer called xylazine that is showing up in supplies of illicit drugs and contributing to a growing number of human overdose deaths, the first-term Democrat's office said Wednesday. Xylazine, which is being mixed into fentanyl and other illicit opioids, will remain legal for its intended use by veterinarians. The bill received approval from the state House of Representatives and the Senate in the past week. Under the bill, xylazine (a.k.a. tranq) will be listed as a “schedule III” drug under Pennsylvania’s controlled substance law, formalizing an order that Shapiro issued last year when Pennsylvania joined a growing list of states that were moving to restrict access to xylazine. Xylazine is a prescription sedative used by veterinarians to safely handle and treat farm animals, wildlife, zoo animals and household pets such as cats and dogs. Officials say the pain-relieving, muscle-relaxing drug, sometimes referred to as “tranq,” is often abused by being added to fentanyl and heroin. It was detected in 3,000 U.S. drug deaths in 2021, according to the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. The illicit use of schedule III drugs carries a penalty of imprisonment of up to five years. The law would require that the drug be stored safely when used professionally, to prevent theft or improper access. Federal officials last year declared xylazine-laced fentanyl an “emerging threat” and introduced a plan to scale up testing, treatment and efforts to intercept illegal shipments of xylazine. Xylazine can cause breathing and heart rates to fall to dangerous levels when used in humans. When injected it can cause large open sores and infections, sometimes leading to amputation.",

        "content": "Officials with the Philadelphia Parking Authority began a new effort Monday that is intended to focus on punishing those who park illegally in ways that impede the mobility of people with disabilities. Two weeks ago, officials with the PPA detailed a new ADA Mobility Access Initiative that introduces new public education efforts and enhanced enforcement on illegal parking that impedes mobility of people with disabilities -- including prohibited parking on sidewalks and blocking curb cuts and crosswalks. PPA Executive Director Rich Lazer admitted that for a long time drivers were able to get away with parking illegally. Drivers who continue to park illegally will be fined. The fines will range from $50 to $76 depending on where the person is parked and the violated, according to the PPA. What happens if people choose not to pay the fines? They'll face getting a boot put on their car instead. In order to present this initiative, the PPA has partnered with Variety, a nonprofit in the Delaware Valley that supports children with disabilities. \"The PPA is honored to partner with Variety - the children's charity of the Delaware Valley - on this very important and worthwhile initiative. They are a tremendous charity with a long history of serving young people with disabilities. They were instrumental in helping us with the messaging and production of the PSAs,\" said PPA Executive Director Rich Lazer in a statement. Along with a ticketing crackdown, the PPA and Variety have produced a number of new informational videos that can be viewed online. In a statement, the organizations said that the goal of this new effort \"is to change behavior and raise public awareness to the adverse impact on people with disabilities when motorists park illegally on sidewalks or block curb cuts and crosswalks.\" In order to give residents ample notice of the pending enhanced enforcement, the PPA distributed warning notices in the lead up the start of the new initiative.",

        "content": "HOWELL, Mich. (AP) — A judge set a fall trial Friday for a pharmacist charged with second-degree murder in the deaths of 11 Michigan residents who died in a 2012 meningitis outbreak linked to contaminated steroids from a Massachusetts lab.\n\nEfforts by Glenn Chin and state prosecutors to reach a plea bargain “have been unsuccessful,” said Livingston County Judge Matthew McGivney, who set jury selection for Nov. 4.\n\nMichigan is the only state to charge Chin and Barry Cadden, an executive at the New England Compounding Center in Framingham, Massachusetts, for deaths related to the outbreak.\n\nMore than 700 people in 20 states were sickened with fungal meningitis or other debilitating illnesses, and dozens died as a result of tainted steroids shipped to pain clinics, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe lab’s “clean room,” where steroids were prepared and staff typically wore coveralls and hairnets, was rife with mold, insects and cracks, investigators said. Chin supervised production.\n\nChin, 56, is currently serving a 10 1/2-year federal sentence for racketeering, fraud and other crimes connected to the outbreak, following a 2017 trial in Boston.\n\n“I am truly sorry that this ever occurred,” he said at his federal sentencing.\n\nChin’s attorney, James Buttrey, declined to comment outside court Friday.\n\nIn April, while waiting for a status hearing in the case, Buttrey told a prosecutor that Chin was concerned that a plea deal in Michigan still could keep him in custody beyond his federal sentence.\n\nChin’s lawyers have repeatedly argued that second-degree murder charges are not appropriate, though they have lost at every turn.\n\n“There has never been a second-degree murder charge arising from what is really a products liability case in this country. Certainly this is a novel idea in Michigan,” attorney Kevin Gentry told the state Supreme Court in 2022.\n\nCadden, 57, was recently sentenced to at least 10 years in prison after pleading no contest to involuntary manslaughter. Second-degree murder charges were dropped.\n\nCadden’s Michigan sentence will run at the same time as his 14 1/2-year federal sentence, and he will also get credit for time in custody since 2018. Overall it means he might not have to serve any additional time behind bars, a result that rankles victims’ families.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

(WILX) - A local high school senior captured the attention of some of the nation’s most prestigious universities. Kelli Higgins from Jackson High School sat down with News 10 to talk about her journey to the Ivy League.\n\n“I was accepted into Harvard, Yale, Columbia, and the University of Pennsylvania.”\n\nFour Ivy League universities have their eyes set on the graduating senior. She called it a long process of visiting campuses, attending admitted students weeks, and learning more about each of the ivies.\n\nWith dreams of becoming a lawyer and considering the political and law opportunities, Higgins said she was ready to make a decision.\n\n“I decided on Harvard.”\n\nShe said the main reason was “because I had prior experience at the school through attending programs there, and I just really enjoyed the campus culture.”\n\nHiggins said she is not the first Jackson High School graduate to attend an Ivy League, but she said she is the first Person of Color.\n\n“So, at Jackson High,” she said, “we’ve obviously seen people attend Ivy Leagues, be accepted into Ivy Leagues, which is very inspiring to see. However, we haven’t seen someone go to Harvard, especially a Black woman, go to an Ivy League as well.\n\nShe called it “a really big deal.”\n\nHiggins said she took advanced placement classes and participated in extracurricular activities involving government and law, all brushing up on essay writing and interview skills. During freshman year, she said she joined the Mayor’s Youth Council. “Where I got to work on ordinances and just help improve the quality of life for youth in Jackson.\n\n“Additionally, I have worked at the Capitol interning with different politicians, such as Senator Sue Shink.”\n\nShe may not be the first student from Jackson High to attend the ivies, but she’s the first in her family.\n\nShe leaves for Harvard University at the end of August.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

        "content": "LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - Friday, May 17, marks 70 years since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brown vs Board of Education. The ruling established that segregation in public schools is unconstitutional.\n\nLocal experts say 70 years later, we still have a long way to go.\n\nAfter the ruling in 1954, MSU Professor Terah Chambers says about 40,000 black teachers were forced out of the profession. She estimates that number may be higher and says the loss of representation is something that schools still haven’t come back from.\n\n“It was a huge loss, in terms of the actual numbers of educators, but also in terms of the impact they would’ve had on our educational system over time,” said Chambers, who is also MSU’s Associate Dean for Equity and Inclusion.\n\nAccording to the Lansing School District’s Human Resources Report from 2018 to 2023, teachers in the predominantly black district were overwhelmingly white.\n\nLansing School Board President Rachel Willis knows just how important representation is for students of color, as her mother was a member of that same board.\n\n“We know that the field of education is predominantly white and not necessarily a diverse field. During Black History Month this year, we recognized Dr. Olivia Letts, who was the first black teacher in the Lansing School District. Dr. Olivia Letts lived during my lifetime, so we’re not very far removed,” said Willis.\n\nWorking to end the long-standing issues of fewer teachers of color in the classroom, she says the district has created an Equity Advisory Committee and works closely with universities to recruit staff of color.\n\nMSU Assistant Professor John Kuk says issues like these still run deep and are extremely difficult to change.\n\n“If you look at the map in the 1950s ′s, and the map in recent years, they will look more or less similar in terms of racial segregation happening. Any city you pick, you’re still going to see that massive segregation pattern,” said Kuk.\n\nHoping to move integration forward by understanding how the past impacts the present day.\n\nIn the 22-23 school year, the most recent year we have data, Lansing teachers were about 80% white. Black educators comprised about 10% of their teaching staff that same school year.\n\nThe district created the Equity Advisory Committee shortly after Ingham County declared racism a public health crisis.\n\nLansing School District Human Resources Update by Samantha on Scribd\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

        "content": "LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - Former Michigan State University head football coach Mel Tucker’s lawyers were in court Thursday morning in connection to the ongoing case between him and Brenda Tracy.\n\nThe lawsuit focused on text messages released last year by Tucker and his attorneys. Messages that Tracy said would harm her businesses.\n\nIn September, Tracy accused Tucker of sexually harassing her. Following the allegation, MSU conducted a Title IX investigation and determined that Tucker had sexually exploited Tracy, leading to his subsequent firing.\n\nTucker’s name was rarely mentioned during the hearing, but today’s decision means he would be able to use text messages between Brenda Tracy and her assistant in a case challenging his firing by Michigan State University. Tracy’s attorneys tried blocking the release saying they effectively ruined her non-profit. Tucker’s attorneys said the texts show their relationship was consensual.\n\nTracy’s attorneys filed a lawsuit over text messages between Tracy and her now-deceased friend and assistant Ahlan Alvarado.\n\nIn the court hearing on May 16, the plaintiff—an attorney representing Tracy’s businesses, LLC and nonprofit—accused Tucker that the texts his attorneys released during the Title IX investigation could have tarnished her nonprofit.\n\n“This case is specifically about an organization that used to do so much good for sexual violence survivors for women in women’s shelters and children who are with them in these women’s shelters,” said Eric Delaporte, Brenda Tracy’s Attorney.\n\nIngham County Judge Wanda Stokes dismissed the case Thursday—saying Tracy didn’t provide ample proof of an invasion of privacy, misappropriation of business records, and eavesdropping by the former MSU football coach. A total of 7 complaints were filed with the Ingham County court.\n\n“They still have the text messages. You can’t convert something when the person still has them,” Andrew Abood, Mel Tuckers, Attorney.\n\n“Based upon the court reading of the briefs, reading of the law, and the allegations and the complaint. The court is going to grant the motion for summary disposition,” Judge Wanda Stokes, Ingham County.\n\nStokes ruled a dismissal with prejudice in favor of the defendant - Tucker, meaning Tracy’s businesses can’t retry the case. Delaporte said several times during the hearing that he represents Tucker’s LLC and non-profit.\n\nThis doesn’t end the legal troubles for Mel Tucker. He has sued MSU over his firing. in March, Brenda Tracy filed “an intent to sue” Tucker. A first step before a lawsuit can be filed. Tucker and his wife are currently going through a divorce.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

        "content": "LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - Priscilla Bordayo believes in rehabilitation and restoration for every person, even her own father, who sexually abused her when she was only a teenager.\n\nBordayo said her father is a changed man, and it’s because of evidence-based programming that focuses on rehabilitation. Now, she wants to see those same programs applied in Michigan’s justice system, to offer peace of mind for crime survivors like herself, and offenders.\n\n“This bill came straight from survivors,” Bordayo said. “Survivors said what they want more than anything is what happened to them, not to happen again.”\n\nNonprofit organization Crime Survivors for Safety and Justice, of which Bordayo is the Michigan Statewide Manager, is behind a series of bills introduced in the Michigan Legislature last week that would let prisoners earn productivity credits on a monthly basis, working toward a possible 20% off their time served.\n\nCredits would be earned through prisoner participation in any program that focuses on rehabilitation, from workforce training to education, or treatment and re-entry.\n\n“It’s not a matter of if they come out, it’s when they come out,” Bordayo said. “And the question we have to ask as a community is how do we want them to come out?”\n\nWhile some violent criminals would be exempt from earning credits, including those serving time for first- or second-degree murder, the possibility of a productivity credit program is concerning to Ingham County Prosecutor John Dewane.\n\n“I believe in truth in sentencing,” he told News 10. “That’s been around for 25 to 30 years, and that provides certainty to victims.”\n\nDewane said he’s advocating for victims who want to see their offenders serve the time they were given. Additionally, he said Michigan is already seeing fewer inmates returning to the prison system after they’ve been released, and that it’s because of programs already being offered.\n\n“So, to me, why should you get good time credit for things that you should already be doing in an attempt to make parole at your first review?” Dewane said.\n\nRegardless of how many productivity credits an inmate earns, whether they’re granted early parole would still be up to a parole board. A package of Senate Bills outlining the productivity credit program was introduced on the Senate floor last week. They’ve been passed along to the Senate Committee on Civil Rights, Judiciary and Public Safety.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

They are now offering $10,000 to anyone who has information that can lead to the solving of the crime.\n\nHomeWorks president and CEO Chris O’Neill first noticed gunshots on his electrical equipment in April 2023. He thought it was just a one-time occurrence, but he started to notice a pattern.\n\n“The areas that were seeing it were specific to Eaton, Ionia and Clinton counties,” O’Neill said. “The repetition we’re seeing, you know, one almost every single month.”\n\nChris and the local police have been working to solve this crime since the beginning, but it still hasn’t been solved. The company is now turning to the public for support.”\n\n“Because of the rural nature of our service footprint and that these are occurring in rural spaces overnight, it’s compounded the issue of trying to gather information to bring this to an end,” said O’Neill.\n\nThe Ionia County sheriff’s office sent a statement. “If a citizen sees something in their neighborhood that is out of the normal, don’t approach or confront. Be a great witness by noticing details such as clothing type and color, height, hair color and style, vehicles (make, model, color), and direction of travel,” the statement read.\n\nThe equipment damaged included voltage regulations, transformers and capacitors. So far, this has cost the company $250,000. O’Neill said power outages have happened as a side effect of this. He said he wants to solve this and continue to provide reliable electricity for his customers.\n\nTo report information about these crimes, call the Michigan State Police Lakeview Post at (989) 352-8444 or HomeWorks at (800) 562-8232.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

        "content": "LANSING, Mich. (WILX/WNEM/WLUC) - New election laws designed to increase transparency to election data and remove barriers to voting are being considered by lawmakers.\n\nThe bills being considered by the Michigan Senate would do a number of things including encouraging the Secretary of State to partner with universities to create a nonpartisan institute that centralizes election data in one database.\n\nAnother bill would make interpreters available at polling locations, create curbside voting for voters with disabilities and allow groups to provide food, drink or entertainment in voting lines, as long as it doesn’t promote a candidate or interrupt the voting process.\n\nThere are over 1500 clerks in the state of Michigan. Currently, to get access to the state’s full election data, people have to file a Freedom of Information Act request (FOIA) with each of those clerks. Democrats and voting rights advocates say the proposed database and institute would take some of the load off clerks and make it easier to access election data. The new Michigan Voting Election Database and Institute would also provide training on Michigan’s voting systems and research on things like voter demographics. However, Republicans are raising concerns saying the data that’s provided could be biased.\n\nOne of the bill sponsors, Sen. Jeremy Moss (D), Southfield said the goal is not to skew or provide data that would only benefit one party, but provide more information on election results.\n\n“The goal is to take this data from these elected officials and house it within the institute for anon-biased, nonpartisan source a university to be able to provide this information to those who request it,” Sen. Moss explained.\n\nRepublican Senator and Vice Chair to the Senate Committee on Elections and Ethics, Sen. Ruth Johnson (R), Holly raised the issue with a portion of the bill that allows the Secretary of State to control the database and institute if they choose not to partner with a university.\n\n“That means whoever the Secretary of State is can make all those decisions on what [information] is going out, and it could benefit one party over another. I mean, this is not necessarily an institute; this gives the Secretary of State that option, too,” Sen. Johnson stated.\n\nLawmakers are also considering a bill allowing groups to provide food, drink and entertainment for voters waiting in line. Another provision would provide interpreters for voters who have a language barrier and curbside voting for those with mobility issues.\n\nSen. Ed McBroom (R), Waucedah, questioned if adding curbside voting is necessary, pointing to emergency absentee ballots that are already provided for those who can’t make it to the polls.\n\n“Right now, under current law, somebody can even have a ballot delivered to their home on election day, or to a jail cell or a hospital bed. Why is this an improvement on the current emergency ballot provisions,” Sen. McBroom asked.\n\nBill sponsor Sen. Erika Geiss (D), Taylor said the bill would further ensure those who can’t access a polling site still have the option to vote.\n\n“There have been instances where voters have gone to cast a ballot only to find on arrival that an elevator was out of service, the stairs were too cumbersome to traverse or the physical distance of the polling location presented a significant challenge,” Sen. Geiss explained.\n\nWhile Democrats say the bill gives voters more rights, Republicans say it sets clerks up for more lawsuits. Voting rights advocate Erica Peresman of Promote the Vote believes the new bills would ultimately make it easier to vote and provide information that could help improve Michigan’s voting systems.\n\n“I think we can all agree, despite any political difference we may have, that we want our elections to be freely and fairly run everywhere in our state,” Peresman said.\n\nThe laws are still being discussed in committee, meaning changes could be made as lawmakers continue their work on improving transparency and access to Michigan elections.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

        "content": "LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - Six Michigan men were arrested for allegedly being responsible for the theft of over 400 vehicles worth about $8 million throughout the state.\n\nMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said the alleged criminal ring targeted new car storage lots at manufacturing facilities, dealerships, parking lots and individual residences. It is alleged the criminal ring operated in over 40 jurisdictions in Oakland, Washtenaw, Macomb, and Wayne counties—with other instances occurring in Eaton and Kent counties.\n\nThe stolen vehicles were allegedly sold below market value on the black market to buyers interested in purchasing unregistered vehicles. Nessel said the stolen vehicles were linked to armed robberies, weapons offenses, felony evasion of police, car-jackings, murder and attempted murder. The group is accused of using countersurveillance to seal the car quickly and efficiently, allegedly shooting at officers and ramming security vehicles if confronted.\n\n“The activities of criminal organizations like these go far beyond theft,” said Nessel. “They cause millions in financial losses to our retail partners, sow fear, and endanger lives. Vehicles stolen as part of this criminal enterprise go on to become tools in violence, posing additional threats to public safety. I commend the hard work of the FORCE Team, Troy Police Department, and other local law enforcement agencies to investigate and dismantle this operation.”\n\nThe investigation into the crime ring began in August 2023 by the Troy Police Department and partnered with the attorney general’s FORCE Team in early 2024 to mitigate the criminal organizations. The investigation received help from agencies from the municipal police departments of Auburn Hills, Canton, Dearborn, Detroit, Eastpointe, Farmington Hills, Lansing, Livonia, Novi, Roseville, Royal Oak, Sterling Heights, Southfield, Walled Lake, and Warren, as well as the Oakland County Auto Theft Group and Macomb County Auto Theft Unit.\n\nThe following suspects were charged with Conducting a Criminal Enterprise and Use of a Computer to Commit a Crime, both 20-year felonies:\n\nKevin Lamont Stevenson Jr., 21, of Detroit, who has been additionally charged with nine counts of Receiving and Concealing a Stolen Motor Vehicle\nJoseph David Doyle, 25, of Onsted, who has been additionally charged with six counts of Receiving and Concealing a Stolen Motor Vehicle\nBraylen Jeese Green, 20, of Wixom, who has been additionally charged with nine counts of Receiving and Concealing a Stolen Motor Vehicle\nDejhon Trevon Bush, 20, of Detroit, who has been additionally charged with seven counts of Receiving and Concealing a Stolen Motor Vehicle\nZamarr Terrell Johnson, 18, of Troy, who has been additionally charged with 12 counts of Receiving and Concealing a Stolen Motor Vehicle and two counts of 4th Degree Fleeing or Eluding\nDesmond Maurice Wilson, 21, of Detroit, who has been additionally charged with nine counts of Receiving and Concealing a Stolen Motor Vehicle and one count of Breaking and Entering with Intent.\n\nThe attorney general’s office is working with Michigan State Police to find and arrest two more suspects. They have not released the suspect’s names.\n\n“In my tenure of 30-plus years, I have never seen such bold and brazen thefts from new car auto dealerships,” said Rod Alberts, co-executive director of the Detroit Auto Dealers Association. “This has become an epidemic of organized criminals preying on businesses in our communities and putting law enforcement and the general public in harm’s way, not just during the theft itself, but on the streets after they have stolen the vehicles. I want to thank the Attorney General and her staff for the steps and actions they have taken. It will make a difference.”\n\nThe investigation is ongoing. All suspects are in jail in multiple locations throughout southeast Michigan.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

        "content": "FLINT, Mich. (WNEM) - A toddler died after shooting himself and his father is facing charges, according to Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton.\n\nOfficers with the Flint Major Crime Unit were dispatched to a Flint home on the 700 block of E. Philadelphia Avenue for a report of a shooting about 2:45 a.m. on Wednesday, May 15.\n\nA toddler died after shooting himself and his father is facing charges, according to Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton.\n\nUpon arrival, officers found the victim, a 2-year-old boy, with a gunshot wound to the head, Leyton said.\n\nThe toddler’s 26-year-old father was at the home at the time of the shooting, and he told officers the toddler shot himself with an airsoft gun, Leyton said.\n\nOfficers followed the blood trail to an upstairs bedroom where they located a Glock 22 40-caliber pistol, Leyton said, adding the gun was registered to a 31-year-old Flint man who does not have a Concealed Pistol License (CPL). The gun was found on a bed alongside a pool of blood and what appeared to be brain matter.\n\nLeyton said the toddler was taken to Hurley Medical Center where he was pronounced dead at 3:04 a.m.\n\nInvestigators determined the toddler’s father was with two cousins at the Philadelphia Avenue address earlier in the evening, Leyton said. One of the cousins was the Flint man the pistol was registered to, and the other was that man’s brother, a 25-year-old Flint Township man who does have a CPL.\n\nInvestigators executed a search warrant and said a strong odor of marijuana was detected at the residence. Investigators determined the men were smoking marijuana, Leyton said, adding it is believed the cousins left the Philadelphia Avenue address at 1 a.m.\n\nAt some point, the toddler’s father heard a gunshot and found him with the gun and a gunshot wound, according to Leyton.\n\nInvestigators searched the home and found a trail of blood going from outside the home to the living room, where there was a large amount of blood and suspected brain matter, Leyton said. The blood continued up the stairs to the bedroom, where a bag of a “leafy green product,” suspected to be marijuana, was found, Leyton said.\n\nInvestigators discovered the Glock 22 40-caliber pistol loaded with a magazine with 15 live rounds, Leyton said, adding there was a fired cartridge casing still in the magazine well of the pistol.\n\nLeyton said there was a large pool of blood on the bed’s pillows, along with suspected brain matter, and a bullet hole was found in the ceiling directly above the pillows. Investigators retrieved a fired slug from the ceiling.\n\n“This is a terrible tragedy. A little 2-year-old guy, he’s gone,” Leyton said.\n\nArrest warrants for the father and two cousins have been drafted by the prosecutor’s office and submitted to the district court, Leyton said, adding after the warrants are approved, arraignments will follow.\n\nLeyton said the father is facing the following charges:\n\nViolation of Michigan’s safe storage law causing death\nInvoluntary manslaughter\nFelon in possession of a firearm\nLying to a police officer regarding a violent crime investigation\nPossession of a firearm while under the influence of a controlled substance\nThree counts of felony firearm\n\nLeyton said the cousins are each facing the following charges:\n\nViolation of Michigan’s safe storage law causing death\nInvoluntary manslaughter\nPossession of a firearm while under the influence of a controlled substance\nTwo counts of felony firearm\n\nThe incident remains under investigation.\n\n“Under Michigan’s safe storage law, the owner of the residence is responsible and the owner of the firearm is also responsible so, there’s no excuse. You have to lock up a firearm and store it if there’s a minor present,” Leyton said.\n\nMichigan’s safe storage law took effect this past February, requiring weapons to be unloaded and locked with a locking device, or stored in a lock box, if it is reasonably known that a child is likely going to be at the location.\n\n“You need to lock your gun in a securely locked box if there’s a minor child in the house,” Leyton said. “Because a little child is going to be curious, they’re going to get their hands on that gun, they’re not going to understand the ramifications of pulling the trigger, and we’re going to have a dead 2-year-old boy.”\n\nHowever, this isn’t the first time since the law that a child in Genesee County has shot themselves.\n\nOn February 14, a day after the measure went into place, 3-year-old girl shot herself in the head in Flint.\n\nShe survived, and her father is facing multiple felonies, including violation of the Michigan safe storage of firearms law. The 2-year-old boy’s father is now facing that charge as well.\n\nRelated: Flint toddler who shot herself undergoes another major surgery\n\n“I want the public to know I’m going to enforce this law to the fullest extent,” Leyton said.\n\nTV5 is not releasing the name of the father or the child because the father has not yet been arraigned.\n\nLeyton and MSP said there are resources available for parents and gun owners. Each MSP post has gun locks available to residents. Anyone can show up and ask for a gun lock.\n\nSubscribe to the TV5 newsletter and receive the latest local news and weather straight to your email every day.\n\nCopyright 2024 WNEM.

        "content": "LANSING, Mich. (WILX)—On Wednesday, Jackson hosted a discussion about gun violence and how to stop it.\n\nKatherine Schweit is a Jackson native and former Chicago prosecutor turned FBI agent. She was tasked with leading the FBI’s active shooter initiatives immediately after the Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting back in 2012. Now, she travels around the country to tell people how they can help stop violence in schools, businesses, and in their daily lives.\n\n“We have to want to have less firearms violence, or we won’t have it. We won’t do a better job at it unless we choose to do it,” said Schweit.\n\nIn uncharted territory, she was tasked with how to define what is classified as a shooting that has multiple casualties.\n\n“We worked with the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, we’re going to call these active shooters because active shooters are when an individual is actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a crowded area,” said Schweit.\n\nNow that it’s been defined, she says people are always concerned about sending their kids to school, but people don’t know that active shooter situations happen more often at businesses than anywhere else.\n\n“We found that for every two shootings in a place of business, there was only 1 in a school,” said Schweit, pushing for better mental health resources in schools but also in general nationwide, “We also found that in middle schools and high schools, middle school and high school kids shoot up their own schools. Your problem is inside the school.”\n\nHow can normal people stop an active shooter, though? Schweit says to act before the shooting occurs.\n\n“You could be saving your life or the life of a loved one by calling law enforcement, calling a school counselor, calling a pastor, and saying I’m concerned about this person. Of the 160 shootings, 13 percent of those were successfully and safely interrupted by an unarmed civilian, 13%,” said Schweit.\n\nSchweit also brought up the Oxford High School shooting, where she says not only was the trial unprecedented with charging the parents but also that Ethan Crumbley was charged with terrorism. She says this is the first time a school shooter was charged with that, but she doesn’t believe it will be the last.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

        "content": "LANSING, Mich. (WILX/WNEM/WLUC) - Lawmakers moved legislation forward Wednesday that supporters say would protect renters’ rights and opposers say would take rights away from landlords.\n\nThe bill package passed by the House Judiciary Committee Wednesday would amend the Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination in real estate transactions based on someone’s race, sexual orientation, or gender identity, to also include people’s source of income. The law would prohibit landlords with five or more rental units from denying a lease to someone based on their receiving government assistance.\n\nMany people who receive assistance through a veteran’s housing voucher or Section 8 voucher in Michigan are being turned away by landlords because they do not have a stable enough income. The bill sponsor, Rep. Jason Morgan (D), Ann Arbor, argued that if people can afford to pay their rent, they should be able to rent regardless of how they can afford it.\n\n“We have landlords who will say, no, I don’t want to deal with those folks, and I’m not going to rent to them. This bill would protect these people. So, they’re getting the same fair shot that anybody else who can demonstrate their rent would get,” Rep. Morgan explained.\n\nWhile the bills did move forward Wednesday, that didn’t come without some pushback from Republican lawmakers. Rep. Andrew Fink (R), Hillsdale County, said he’s concerned the change would put an unnecessary economic burden on landlords and developers, in turn hurting development in the state.\n\n“My concern would be that this would fail to address the fundamental problem that we have, which is a lack of housing supply of all kinds,” Rep. Fink said.\n\nRep. Morgan argued lawmakers should be helping people during the state’s housing crisis, not making it tougher for people trying to find housing.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

        "content": "LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - Court documents obtained by News 10 reveal new details about the death of a 25-year-old on Georgetown Blvd that happened on May 12.\n\nAt around 7 a.m. on May 12, police responded to a physical altercation between Zacarri Marquise Taylor, 25, and several others near the 2100 block of Georgetown Boulevard.\n\nOfficers learned Taylor was taken from a home to an unknown location by multiple suspects, and the man could be seriously injured. Officials later found Taylor dismembered at an undisclosed location.\n\nPrevious Coverage:\n\n25-year-old man killed on Georgetown Blvd in Lansing\n‘High probability of additional arrests to come’ in Georgetown Blvd homicide, says Lansing Police Chief\n\nCourt documents reveal that a witness saw Leonard Felton Hayes, along with his brother, Marcus Lee Hayes, get into a fight with the victim that appeared to result in their death.\n\nDocuments state that in a video capturing the altercation, Leonard Hayes can be seen physically fighting the victim after being hit by them. The video then showed Leonard Hayes strangling the victim on the floor of the living room of the Georgetown Blvd. apartment.\n\nThe victim was seen signaling to forfeit the fight and then became unresponsive. Leonard Hayes continued to strangle the victim.\n\nIn the documents, Marcus Hayes stated that he proceeded to strangle the victim after Leonard and then helped him get the victim out of view of the known camera in the apartment into the kitchen.\n\nOfficials said Leonard Hayes wrapped the victim in a bed sheet and then carried the victim to his car, where Marcus Hayes stated he rode in the rear passenger seat with the victim lying across the backseat.\n\nMarcus stated that they picked up a third person, Terrence James Jones, who sat in the front passenger seat, and he suggested directing them to the residence of an associate of Jones on Malcolm X Street.\n\nMarcus Hayes said in the documents that they brought the victim’s body into the basement of the home, where they discussed whether or not to burn the body.\n\nLeonard Hayes stated in the court documents that the body would be dismembered, and the men agreed so. The body was dismembered by Marcus Hayes, according to documents.\n\nA search warrant was obtained, and the body was eventually found dismembered, a gruesome detail in the case that’s now being handled by Ingham County Prosecutor John Dewane’s office.\n\n“Whether it’s dismembering, setting it afire, discarding it in a landfill, or anything like that nature,” Dewane told News 10. “So it doesn’t surprise me that a person who has the ability to murder somebody, would take the body and try to make it disappear.”\n\nDewane said because the case is pending, and the prosecution is just getting started, it’s difficult for him to comment on the details, but based on what he’s learned so far he said it’s “very graphic, and it’s disturbing to hear what occurred in that case.”\n\nDocuments state that Leonard Hayes has convictions for a controlled substance in 2007, CCW, and felony possession in 2018, and a firearm discharge in a building in 2018.\n\nMarcus Hayes has multiple convictions, including fraud charges and controlled substance violations.\n\nTerrance Jones has been convicted of armed robbery and homicide in 2006, as well as two counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm in 2020.\n\n“My goal is to ensure that victims have their day in court and that they’re heard,” Dewane said. “And if you commit serious violence in our community, you’ll be held accountable by my office.”\n\nThe Hayes brothers and their alleged accomplice, Jones, are expected to be back in court May 31 to determine if there is enough evidence to send the case to trial.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

        "content": "EAST LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - We rely on our farmers to produce fresh fruits and vegetables, and they rely on the weather to keep the fresh foods coming. A new partnership between Michigan State University (MSU) and the State Department of Agriculture is working to address challenges in farming.\n\nThis new partnership aims to help farmers adjust their practices to climate change. To this end, the state of Michigan granted MSU’s New Agricultural Climate Resiliency Program $5 million to fund four projects. The funds for agricultural research will be released to MSU over three years.\n\nThat includes developing climate-smart technology to optimize irrigation, cropping systems, and pest management. Agriculture experts say this is a long-term experiment to solve the challenges of the future.\n\n“Whether it be extreme precipitation, whether it be drought,” said George Smith. Or an unexpected early frost. All types of weather conditions that can destroy crops and put a pause on your next salad.\n\nGeorge Smith, with the Michigan State AgBioResearch, says new state funding will benefit agriculture’s future.\n\n“These innovations are gonna help keep our agriculture industries in business because they need solutions, and it’s a really tough time for agriculture right now,” said Smith.\n\nHillcrest Farms has provided fresh produce for more than 20 years.\n\n“In the beginning, production was predictable,” said Mark Kastner. “You could pretty much predict the weather and you could grow around or in harmony with the weather. Climate change has changed. Now we grow on our own schedule, and we adapt our protection to protect us against the weather changes.”\n\nKastner now plants his crops inside greenhouses to protect against changes in weather.\n\n“We’re seeing the effects of climate change in real-time now,” said Tim Boring, Michigan Department of Agriculture and Development. “And that poses a unique challenge to a state like Michigan with a really diversified cropping system.”\n\nThe funds will also protect the quality of Michigan water, which Smith says will be important for future generations.\n\n“Michigan is the most diverse agricultural state in the country with a reliable source of water,” said Smith. “We can’t take that for granted, and we have to make sure we utilize the water we have efficiently.”\n\nAgriculture experts say Michigan is heading in the right direction when it comes to agriculture, as the state ranks sixth in the nation for total production.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

(WILX) - You may have heard of the local superheroes from Michigan’s League of Enchantment. It’s a group of about 20 people who wear superhero costumes and go to local hospitals, spreading smiles to sick children in Mid-Michigan.\n\nThe organization was moving when a trailer carrying more than $40,000 worth of items blew a tire and caught fire. Costumes, computers, and toys for hospital care packages were destroyed.\n\n(WILX)\n\nNow, the league needs some help of their own as they try to get back to bringing joy to kids.\n\nThe non-profit is made up of people who live and work in Lansing, like President Shamus Smith.\n\nOn Wednesday, Smith told News 10 how the fire started.\n\n“We were moving all of our items from our storage area in Dewitt to our new office in Leslie.”\n\nSmith said there were “large storage totes filled with toys that we sort and take to the hospitals with us on our visits.” He said just south of Holt Road, he started to notice smoke coming from the back of the moving trailer.\n\n“I pulled over and walked back to see what was going on. Flames were shooting out of the fender well. I kind of went into rush mode. Ran around the back thinking I could put it out. Opened up the backdoor, got hit by a wall of flames and smoke.”\n\nSmith said his arms and legs are a bit singed, but his wife, Katie, also known as Wonder Woman, said the real damage was done to the items inside the trailer.\n\n“Just so much cause we had already taken some of our care packages out, but this was probably 40 to 50 percent of what we had left. Just trying to stuff in the trailer, trying to make sure that we made this run really worth it, and yeah, just lost everything.”\n\nKatie said, “There were thousands of comic books in there.”\n\nShe called it a mix of emotions. “There were a lot of memories in that trailer, lot of things that we can’t replace. But then the overwhelming support from the community has just been absolutely amazing.”\n\nSmith said they have an Amazon Wish List.\n\nMultiple toy drives have been set up in the community to gather toys and other items so the league can continue their mission. You can donate items to the following businesses:\n\nSummit Comics and Games\nTinkr Labs\nPreuss Pets\n\nThe league has also started a fundraiser on Facebook. So far, they’ve raised more than $5,000.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

        "content": "LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - Canadian wildfires have reached the northern and central United States.\n\nLast year, air quality alerts in Michigan lasted several days due to the hazy smokey air. And there is potential for the smoke to return this year.\n\nKeeping track of air quality and the health impact of the smoke is important, even if the wildfires are not as bad as last year.\n\nMany Michiganders are already dealing with seasonal allergies. But the EPA says these wildfires carry a mixture of pollutants that will also make you cough and wheeze, making it difficult to breathe.\n\nCanada’s wildfire season is already affecting the US. Smoke has moved into neighboring states and it’s only a matter of time until heavier smoke hits Michigan.\n\n“We saw just a tremendous amount of smoke that came from all the wildfires that burned last year come into our region, and that’s something that we will have to watch out for again this year,” said First Alert meteorologist Colton Cichoracki.\n\nCichoracki says these wildfires are a result of mild winters in Canada along with dry weather.\n\n“You need rain, you need snow, you need cooler temperatures, and they just haven’t seen a lot of that over the past few years in Canada,” said Cichoracki.\n\nRobert Wahl, a public health professor at Michigan State University, says whatever’s in the fire’s path is going to burn. This includes chemicals and what Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy calls volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Exposure to these pollutants can lead to a variety of health effects.\n\n“People who have asthma are more likely to have asthma exacerbation or have their asthma triggered. If you have underlying heart conditions, you’re more likely to have a heart attack,” said Wahl.\n\n“It can change your lung function, how well you can breathe, how well you exchange your oxygen,” said Karen Barker of UM Health Sparrow Carson.\n\nIf wildfire smoke hits Mid-Michigan, some people may experience symptoms that mimic seasonal allergies. Young children, those over 65, and people with lung and heart conditions are most at risk. Barker says to keep an eye out for air quality alerts and remain cautious.\n\n“Stay inside, use your air conditioning, and if you have to go out, limit your time and activities,” said Barker.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a mobile app called AirNow. It provides daily air quality updates—including a map—and information on active wildfires.\n\nRight now, state-issued air quality alerts, because of smoke coming from Canada, include Montana, North and South Dakota, and Minnesota, as well as parts of Wisconsin and Iowa. Michigan has not issued an alert at this point.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

        "content": "LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - Drowning deaths are on the rise after decades of decline, and the number has increased by 500 deaths from 2019 to 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nThe study found that 40 million adults in the United States don’t know how to swim, and over half of adults have never taken a swimming lesson.\n\n“The CDC stating that teaching swim lessons directly correlates with saving lives completely aligns with what the YMCA believes about the importance of water safety,” said Megan Hunt, the Executive Program Director at the YMCA in Jackson.\n\nChildren 1 to 4 years old, adults 65 years and older, and black people of all ages are at higher risk as they have seen the largest increase in drowning deaths.\n\n“For the most part people will think “I learned how to swim I can handle any situation” but that’s not the case, people usually overestimate their abilities. Yes, we want everyone to know how to swim but we want people to understand knowing how to swim doesn’t substitute proper supervision of children or even teenagers,” said Dave Benjamin, the co-founder of Great Lakes Surf Rescue Project.\n\nThe CDC says water training is vital, not only for children but for their parents as well. Drowning is one of the three leading causes of unintentional deaths for people 5 to 34 years old.\n\n“We have a lot of parents that sign their kids up for swim lessons and then they’ll say you know what I don’t know how to swim either. We recognize that sometimes being afraid of water or uncomfortable around water is not just children that feel that way but adults too,” said Hunt.\n\nThe study found that swim lessons were a proven way to prevent drowning, but disparities like a lack of access to lessons, lessons being too expensive, and historical factors prevent the people who need lessons from getting them. Organizations like the YMCA are working to close that gap during May, Water Safety Month.\n\n“Our free water safety program in May really focuses on teaching kids to think about what it means to be safe around water but also teaching parents about what it means to be safe around water,” said Hunt.\n\nWater safety activists are pushing for a water safety curriculum in schools nationwide. A bill that was introduced in the Michigan Senate would require public schools to teach students water safety.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

If you have any questions or any doubts, always turn the tank off and bring it to a retailer so they can inspect it and point you in the right direction,” said Scott Underwood, president of the Michigan Propane Gas Association.\n\nAnother important propane safety tip is to always barbecue at least ten feet away from structures and never store propane tanks indoors.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

        "content": "LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - Two peregrine falcons that nest on top of Lansing’s Board of Water and Light (BWL) recently saw their four eggs hatch. At just four weeks old, the babies have now been banded and named.\n\nThe Falcon family welcomed three males and one female. Their names are Sonic, Blue, Asher and Marty.\n\nThe nest has been on top of BWL’s Eckert power station since 2004, and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has been banding the falcon chicks since 2008. Banding helps track the birds when they become adults.\n\nThis banding process was special, as it was the last one the DNR would do in Michigan.\n\nDina Maneval, also known as “the falcon lady,” has been helping the peregrines since the beginning of 2004. She is now able to see her efforts come full circle.\n\n“They started to lay their eggs up at our roof area,” Maneval said. “I noticed in 2004 that it’s the peregrine falcon, and I said, ‘ok, we’re gonna protect these guys.’”\n\nThe peregrine falcon, the fastest creature on earth, was on the endangered species list of Michigan since 1970. Wildlife biologist Chad Fedewa says they have now been downlisted from an endangered species to a threatened species.\n\n“It’s a good thing that they’re being downlisted, and efforts like this aren’t needed anymore,” Fedewa said.\n\nBWL has been helping the falcon’s nest for 20 years. Even though future falcons won’t be banded, BWL will continue to be a home for them for years to come.\n\nFedewa said all four falcons are healthy and will be ready to leave the nest in three weeks.\n\nTo view the BWL’s falcon cams, click here.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

(WILX) - Civics students at Michigan State University (MSU) have created a website called the “Lansing Citizens Manual.” The goal is to get more young people involved in their community and local government.\n\nAs part of their coursework, the students who created the website wondered why young people aren’t more involved in local politics.\n\n“One of those explanations is that young people don’t see themselves represented in civic institutions, or they don’t see themselves as meaningful participants in the democratic story,” said Nicolas Babarskis, an MSU PHD Student who was closely involved with the websites creation.\n\nHoping to change that view, about 20 MSU students and their professor, Sarah Reckhow, created the website. It provides information about getting involved, local history, and even a game where players can solve problems throughout the city.\n\n“One of my students did an amazing job pulling together all these resources of local organizations that involve youth in Lansing. So many different organizations focus on service or engagement or interest,” said Reckhow.\n\nThe team held a focus group at Lansing Eastern High School, and their students later tested out the completed website. Social studies teacher Sarah Graham says it’s a tool that people, both young and old, could benefit from.\n\n“Especially at the city level, ‘cause so much of our civics education is federal, and that’s important, and state is important too, but local is really what affects our day-to-day life,” said Graham.\n\nA semester-long project inspired by a similar manual created for the city of Detroit.\n\n“There’s an awareness that we need young people to be more engaged in our politics,” said Reckhow.\n\nHoping to show Lansing teens how to make their voices count.

Officials later found Taylor dismembered at an undisclosed location.\n\nLansing Police Chief Ellery Sosebee said the altercation was not gang related and the suspects that were arrested at the scene are in the process of being arraigned. Sosebee said there is a “high probability” that there will be more arrests in connection to the incident soon.\n\nThe suspects arrested in the incident were identified as the following:\n\nMarcus Lee Hayes, 35\nLeonard Felton Hayes, 42\nTerrance James Jones, 37\nLeonard Hayes (left), Marcus Lee Hayes (Middle), Terrance James Jones (Right)(Lansing Police Department)\n\nThe three were charged with open murder and disinterment and mutilation of a body.

It was just a terrible situation, and we got there, and our cops got the person, the folks responsible, immediately.”\n\nIn the first three months of the year, there were zero homicides reported in Ingham County. According to the Ingham County Prosecutor, in comparison, there were four homicides in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThe most recent homicide happened on May 4, 2024, when Lansing police found 14-year-old Jaquez Moye-Young dead following a shooting. Mayor Andy Schor says the city is doing everything it can.\n\n“There was a domestic violence situation. It’s very difficult to combat that,” said Schor. “We’re doing a lot of work. We have Advance Peace that is helping out in preventing retaliations, but when you have someone who’s very bad and does something very bad in a domestic way, it’s just something that you have to navigate, and we had several months where we didn’t see that.”\n\nPolice said they have multiple suspects in custody, which is still an ongoing investigation.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

        "content": "LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - Moores Park has seen better days and will soon see even better.\n\nThe City of Lansing is following through on its plan to restore and reopen the historic Moores Park Pool.\n\nMoores Park Pool has gone through several phases. Now, restoration is finally here, and News 10 has the details. This is a major effort to restore the pool to its former glory.\n\nAfter months of conversations around construction, designs, and a community-led clean-up, Moores Park Pool is now entering its restoration process.\n\n“We have met so many people who are like, I used to swim in that when I was a kid. I used to sit on the benches waiting in line. So many memories from Lansing residents,” said Emily Steves of Lansing Parks and Recreation.\n\nThe century-old pool and its unique shape and design make it an important part of Lansing’s history.\n\n“Wesley Bintz was the city engineer for the City of Lansing, and he designed that pool. So, that’s what makes it significant to us because it kind of the first of many,” said Stevens.\n\nWhat makes Moores Park Pool so unique are the bathrooms beneath the pool. In 2019, the city noticed that the pool began to leak, forcing them to close the pool. Over $6 million later, Moores Park Pool is getting a new life. Brett Tripp, general manager of Rhino Construction, says restoring the pool has been a team effort, from the community clean-up to local contractors joining in to repair the pool.\n\n“Within this renovation, more than 50% is local Lansing-based contractors. It’ll get all new plumbing, it’ll get all new mechanical, it’ll get all new electrical, it’ll get an entirely all-new pool surface,” said Tripp.\n\nThe city’s goal is to keep the pool’s 1920s look, and it plans to use every penny of the over $6 million to restore every detail.\n\n“People are like, it can’t be that much, but it is especially historic, but the city is, we are committed to making sure we get there,” said Stevens.\n\n“There’s this custom concrete pickets; all the broken ones will be replaced. All the globes, you can see the pictures of the pool in its hay day. Had these beautiful globes on top, all of those will be restored,” said Tripp.\n\nAs rehab begins, everyone has the same hope—a pool filled with not only water but also people, and 100 more years of memories.\n\nRhino Construction said the pool’s rebuild begins on Wednesday. It is expected to reopen in the summer of 2025. The only other issue is finding enough lifeguards to staff the pool.Subscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

        "content": "LANSING, Mich. (WILX/WNEM/WLUC) - Protesters gathered in Lansing Tuesday, demanding state officials do something about the rising rent and home prices.\n\nSince the Pandemic, renters and first-time homebuyers in Michigan have struggled to find something affordable. According to Rent.com, Michiganders, on average, are nearly paying an extra $300 a month for rent since the Pandemic hit in 2020.\n\nProtesters, part of the Rent is Too Damn High Coalition gathered outside the Building Michigan Communities Conference Tuesday, where state officials and leaders in the housing industry met to discuss ways to solve the state’s ongoing housing crisis.\n\nProtesters say their goal is to bring awareness to the issue and demand laws currently being considered by the legislature that would protect renters’ rights be passed. The proposed legislation would prevent landlords from hiking rents too high, give renters counsel during the eviction process and prevent a landlord’s ability to withhold a lease based on the person’s income or if they’ve previously been incarcerated.\n\nFrom March 2023 to March 2024, Michigan saw the second-largest spike in rent prices in the country. The nearly 10 percent increase has Michiganders, on average, paying an extra $97 a month. One of the protesters, Vonettea Sanders, said she’s looking for a new place to live after her housing community of nearly a decade raised rent to a rate she couldn’t afford.\n\n“I’m being priced out and pushed out through eviction. These landlords have too much power, and our politicians have an opportunity to change what’s going on and they’re not doing anything about it,” Sanders claimed.\n\nThe Michigan State Housing Development Authority’s Josh Pugh said they are working with lawmakers to try and secure more funding for affordable housing. He also pointed to investments made last year where they gave out $1.2 billion for affordable housing and first-time homebuyers with plans to give out even more this year.\n\n“Rent is too high in Michigan right now. So, we’re focused on doing everything we can to bring that down by building more of every kind of housing and working with locals to make sure those priorities are set at the local level and not just at the state Capitol,” Pugh explained.\n\nThe Coordinator for the Rent is Too Damn High Coalition, William Lawrence, said state leaders should be doing more.\n\n“We need to see more from the legislature to protect renters and stand up to the landlords who right now are blocking progress at the state level,” Lawrence said.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

(WILX) - “This time, I don’t want to wait until another tragedy occurs,” said Saylor Reinders, MSU Students Demand Action.\n\nTragedies like the Oxford High School and Michigan State University (MSU) mass shootings. Saylor Reinders says that gun safety laws won’t bring her peers back.\n\n“It’s about making sure that people aren’t dying because guns are the number one killer of kids today,” said Reinders. Leaders from Moms Demand Action and Students Demand Action are pushing for more safety bills like banning guns at polling places. Kazia Kelly has carried a gun for four years, and she says education starts at home.\n\n“That’s really why we want to pass safe homes, safe Schools,” said Kazia Kelly. “That’s where MDHHS is going to be if this gets passed: give home information to all families who attend Public Schools.”\n\nGovernor Gretchen Whitmer signed a package of gun safety bills into law in 2023. Now, advocates say there’s still more to be done. And those same laws have the backing of many gun owners.\n\n“Our ask, we want again to keep everyone safe,” said Kelly. “Our communities, our families, and I am a gun owner. Anyone who is a responsible gun owner knows we need secure storage, and we need measures in place again to keep everybody safe.”\n\nNews 10 reached out to the Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun Owners and the Michigan Firearms Association for comment and did not receive a response.\n\nReinders says the gun prevention bills were a step in the right direction, but it doesn’t stop there.\n\n“Gun violence is a very multifaceted issue, and it demands nuance solutions,” said Reinders. “So, while we can pass lots of legislation, I don’t think that’s the only solution. I think we also need community violence prevention.”\n\nViolence prevention, they hope, stops the next shooting. Starting this week, if you buy things like trigger locks or gun safes, you do not need to pay sales tax on those items.\n\nThat was part of the legislation Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed into law after the shooting at MSU.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

(WILX) - The 2024 PGA Championship gets underway in Louisville, Kentucky Thursday and ahead of the tournament, News 10 caught up with PGA President John Lindert, who is from Grand Ledge and is also the Director of Golf at the Country Club of Lansing.\n\nThis year’s PGA Championship will be hosted by Valhalla Golf Club, a well-known major championship course. Nearly all of the top-ranked golfers in the world will be in the tournament field. Big names as well including 15-time major champion Tiger Woods. Something unique about the PGA Championship is it’s the only major where there are no amateurs in the field.\n\nLindert has been in the Louisville area for days getting ready for the tournament. He and the tournament’s director spoke to the excitement surrounding the event as we inch closer to the opening round on Thursday.\n\n“I am looking forward to creating memories for people. I remember when my grandfather took me to my first Championship and the memories I had; I am looking forward to creating that for another grandfather and his grandson. or mother and daughter, or whoever comes out and joins us. or best friends. making memories is what we are here for,” said PGA Championship Director Ryan Ogle.\n\n“I think we are going to have somewhere in the neighborhood of 98-99 of the top 100 players on the official world golf ranking playing in this, so it is the strongest field in major championships,” said John Lindert, PGA of America President.\n\nBefore the championship, PGA HOPE, which stands for Honoring Our Patriots Everywhere, held its 9th Secretary’s Cup for Military Veterans from across the country. Around 48 Veterans teed off the University of Louisville Golf Club.\n\nThe event aims to help rehabilitate Veterans through golf. The tournament took place on Monday, with twelve teams, each consisting of one PGA of America golf professional and four military veterans, competing in a nine-hole match.\n\nLindert said that this event is special to him, as his father served in the South Pacific during World War II. Lindert says that the Veterans who took part in this special event have over 570 years of combined service.\n\n“HOPE kind of helps the players get reintroduced into society,” said Lindert. “We have seen players who have gone on and actually wanted to be in the industry and have become golf professionals. So it is not only rehabilitating individuals, but it has actually saved lives and changed lives. It is very impactful. But we love to start our championship week off with the Veteran’s championship, if you will, with HOPE.”\n\n“We want them to feel the pressure of playing for something and representing again, but it is a safe environment,” said Christopher Nowak, PGA of America Military and Veteran Liaison. “In hopes that their brain will look at some sort of anxiety issue, stressful issue, different now that they have had a positive outcome.”\n\nThe teams for the Secretary’s Cup arrived in Louisville, Kentucky on Friday as part of the overall experience. On Saturday, the Veterans and PGA of America golf professionals attended a welcome reception at Churchill Downs. They will also be attending the PGA Championship practice round at Valhalla on Tuesday.\n\nLindert tells News 10 the PGA Championship sold out quickly, and thousands of fans will be heading to Louisville, Kentucky this week. According to a report from the Sports Business Journal, tournament officials are expecting around 200,000 fans throughout the week at Valhalla Golf Club.\n\nLindert also says he’s looking forward to this week when his family will be traveling to join him in Louisville for the tournament. You can see or hear Lindert on several TV and radio broadcasts throughout the week. He will also hand the coveted Wanamaker Trophy to the winner of this year’s PGA Championship at the tournament’s conclusion.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

There’s another word for that: grooming,” said one woman during a public comment.\n\n“When we heard the news of this lesson being canceled, we were very disappointed,” said a DeWitt Public Schools parent.\n\nIn April, the Superintendent sent a letter to parents about the lesson that included reading a book, “They, She, He, Me: Free to Be!” it also included teaching proper pronoun use and genders. The optional lesson was ultimately canceled days later after backlash.\n\n“Teaching our children that they can sit there and pick their own gender; Very sad what’s going on today, very sad,” one man from Dearborn said during a public comment.\n\n“I think about the opportunity to educate their peers, and that opportunity was taken away,” said a parent of DeWitt Schools.\n\nOther people arguing this is not a conversation that is appropriate for school.\n\n“I believe the statistic is 1 in 6 students graduate illiterate. Do we really have time to be teaching such an elective course?” said one DeWitt resident.\n\nDespite interruptions from the crowd, Superintendent Dr. Shanna Spickard confirms that their students are fine and that the district will continue working on the best solution for everyone.\n\n“Our students are excelling, and they’re doing a great job, and there’s a lot of false information about proficiency and graduation rates. Our graduations are in the high 90s, our students are excelling at our target of 80 percent average or higher, our proficiency scores are above state and county averages,” said Dr. Spickard.\n\nThroughout the entire ordeal, Dr. Spickard revealed that multiple school staff members had received online threats and even their information doxed on social media. She said most of those came from people outside the DeWitt community. Since then, there has been increased security at the schools and offices.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

        "content": "LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - Many parents stayed home, and childcare providers closed their doors. National Day Without Childcare is bringing attention to a childcare system that many say needs fixing.\n\nWorkers at one local childcare center understand why this day is important; they couldn’t close their doors on parents.\n\nAccording to the Care.com 2024 Cost of Care Report, in 2023, a family spent an average of 24% of their household income on childcare. 47% of families spent more than $1500 a month or $18,000 a year. That’s more than the average in-state tuition at a public four-year college in Michigan, roughly $15,000.\n\nAcross the nation, parents and childcare providers are rallying together, advocating for affordable and accessible childcare and a livable wage for early childhood educators.\n\nIn Lansing, Helping Hands Christian Learning Center supports the National Day Without Childcare but finds closing a challenge when considering working parents.\n\n“A day without childcare would be really hard cause a lot of our families, they need to work. And so, by us being closed, it would be like a nuisance to them,” said Director of Helping Hands Rachelle Parmelee.\n\nAccording to Care.com, the weekly rate of daycare was $210, about $10,000 a year in Michigan.\n\nParmelee, director of Helping Hands, says their tuition is used to keep their center open.\n\n“The building itself, all of our staff and employees, the food that we serve, we provide all meals for them. And just providing that safe and nurturing care that goes along with childcare,” said Parmelee.\n\nAmy Sofian, Head Preschool Teacher at Helping Hands, has worked in childcare for 25 years. She says that as a parent, she struggled to afford childcare, and with child workers making $12 to $15 an hour, making ends meet has become a new challenge.\n\n“It’s important that we not only get paid our worth but what is necessary for us to survive. The care that we provide here, especially the care that I provide, is the same care I would provide my son,” said Sofian.\n\nSofian is glad Helping Hands stayed open but hopes this national day helps get the word out.\n\n“If a lot more people, a lot more centers knew about this kind of protest, I guess you would call it, that it would bring to light the importance of childcare,” said Sofian.\n\nMichigan’s Department of Lifelong Education, Advancement, and Potential announced earlier this month a $59 million investment that will expand and improve 1,100 childcare facilities across the state. This investment follows Governor Whitmer’s push for free universal preschool.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

        "content": "LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - Former President Donald Trump’s election lawyer, John Eastman, spoke in Lansing on Thursday, claiming the 2020 election was stolen.\n\n“Krebs, the head of CISA, the security agency in Washington DC, says it was the most secure election in history. That’s laughably false,” said Eastman.\n\nThe event in Lansing was held by Michigan Fair Elections.\n\nIn Georgia, John Eastman has been criminally indicted on conspiracy, fraud, and other charges. He is now suspended from practicing law in Washington, D.C., and the state of California. In March, a judge also recommended the lawyer be disbarred. Eastman tells News 10′s Jordyn Burrell that he has no regrets about getting involved with the former president. He says he is standing up for the truth and insists, despite evidence to the contrary, that there were illegalities in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“I have no regrets look it’s extremely important that we follow the constitution and play by the rules when we have elections. Rule number 1 is the constitution assigns plenary authority to the state legislatures to direct the manner to choose electors. That was not followed in Michigan,” said Eastman.\n\nMichigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson says the event was not held to inform but instead pushed election lies as part of a political agenda.\n\n“It’s ironic that one of the least trustworthy voices is somehow now seeking a mantle as someone you should listen to about elections in Michigan. I think the bottom line is citizens shouldn’t be fooled and to expect tactics like these,” said Secretary Benson.\n\nAn investigation by Michigan’s Senate Republicans following the 2020 election found no widespread or systemic fraud, but Eastman continues to question how ballots were handled.\n\n“Signature verification didn’t go on in the TCF Center in Detroit; observation that is required by the law was shut down and prevented in large numbers in the TCF center in Detroit, so these are the kinds of things, the laws that were broken that opened the doors for fraud. Quite frankly, the Michigan investigation was pretty anemic,” said Eastman.\n\nThose claims have been proven false. The city of Detroit says signatures were not being checked at the TCF Center because they were checked before arriving. She says voters need to know there are safeguards in place as they prepare to cast their votes for another presidential election months from now.\n\n“We’re supporting efforts on both sides of the aisle to speak the truth and to bring people together and really try to solve problems for our citizens instead of getting in the mud pit around false information about our elections,” said Secretary Benson.\n\nEastman is encouraging people to volunteer to be poll watchers or poll workers. That may be one area of agreement with Secretary Benson who says helping with elections can also help restore confidence in our election system and voting outcome.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

        "content": "LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - Children of color are put into the system at a disproportionate rate, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nFailing to identify cases of child abuse or neglect can have negative impacts. However, over-reporting can lead to families being caught in the court system and their children pushed into the foster care system. One local advocate shares she believes there are ways to avoid this.\n\nChildren of color make up 31% of Michigan’s population according to Michigan’s Child Welfare Improvement Task Force, yet they make up 51% of the state foster care population.\n\n“When we separate families, we don’t give anyone a pathway to doing it better,” said Tashmica Torok, co-director of the Firecracker Foundation in Lansing.\n\nThe organization frequently works with the foster system. Torok says the problem of over-representation starts with the mandatory reporting of abuse and neglect and the lack of understanding of cultural differences.\n\n“Nurses and doctors or we’re talking about police officers or we’re even talking about teachers. Most of those people don’t share the identities or cultural practices of the people that they’re calling in the state to respond to.”\n\nChildren are then investigated, and parents enter custody battles which result in trauma for the children involved.\n\n“Anytime we remove a child from a family regardless of the circumstances we have to understand we are causing harm and trauma.”\n\nTorok says changing the way reports are reviewed and refining abuse and neglect is necessary.\n\nDesign a different way of approaching harm and violence that doesn’t mean immediate separation, punishment, and harm to the biological family. That is [actually] struggling with inequities and intergenerational trauma.”\n\nAlong with offering parents support in hopes of keeping their child in their home.\n\n“Whether that looks like mental health care, or restorative justice, or transformative justice. There are lots of models for repairing harm and conflict resolutions between people including children.”\n\nMichigan’s Child Welfare Improvement Task Force offered recommendations to Michigan’s Department of Health and Human Services to address racial disparities in the state’s child protection system. Like services and support for relatives and family friends, services that reduce placement in childcare institutions, and funding to assist with these recommendations.\n\nA study from the American Academy of Pediatrics says cases with black children are more likely to be accepted for investigation leading to the removal of a child from their family for a longer period of time and taking longer for the case to be closed.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

(WILX) - Making sure peoples’ mail gets where it needs to go is a big enough job on its own, but letter carriers for the USPS double that workload every May, to give back to the communities they serve.\n\nThe Stamp Out Hunger food drive returned Saturday, giving postal workers across the U.S. an opportunity to give back to the communities they serve. But one Lansing letter carrier has made the event a family affair.\n\nSix days a week, Andrew Kozan delivers mail to people on his south Lansing route, but on Stamp Out Hunger day, he’s also delivering meals to people in need.\n\n“Well for me, it definitely helps our community, because we know a lot of people need food with grocery prices being extremely high,” he said. It definitely helps the people who need it.”\n\nLast year, Stamp Out Hunger raised more than 117,000 pounds of nonperishable food items for local pantries nationwide. It’s a tradition Kozan has taken part in for more than a decade, but he doesn’t work alone.\n\nWhen he’s picking up bags of food from the porches of Lansing residents, the rest of the Kozan family is rolling along in the car, right by his side. An already convenient way to help the Greater Lansing Food Bank keep its shelves stocked, made even more efficient, and more fun with the help of Kozan’s wife, Emily, and his son, Vincent.\n\n“They end up doing a lot of trips back and forth from the street back to the post office to drop off the food, so we like to come out here and help dad get the job done,” Emily said.\n\nWhile she stays behind the wheel, Vincent stays ready to move in backseat, hopping out the side door each time his dad picks up a bag of food, and putting it in the trunk. It’s not just a unique way to spend his Saturday, it’s his way to give back.\n\n“I like coming to do Stamp Out because it helps other people,” he said. “I think it’s fun to do this.”\n\nOnce the Kozan’s trunk is full, Andrew keeps moving on his route to pick up more bags in his USPS van, while Emily and Vincent drop the donations for sorting at the post office. The Kozans say their system is built on teamwork, and they’ve managed to perfect it over the last few years.\n\nThey say it’s special way for them to give back to their neighbors as a family.\n\n“There are many more years to come of this,” Andrew said. “Every year we’re going to do it, every May. Every second Saturday in May is Stamp Out Hunger.”\n\n“It’s our tradition,” Emily added.\n\nStamp Out Hunger only comes around once each year, but the Kozans say local pantries can use donations from the community at any time. They’re hoping to encourage other people to do their part, too.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.

        "content": "LAS VEGAS, Nev. (FOX5) - Thousands of overdose prevention supplies are being distributed across the Las Vegas Valley this year, especially during the weekend of the Electric Daisy Carnival when hundreds of thousands of people are in town.\n\nIn 2023, the Las Vegas Valley saw a record number of deadly fentanyl overdoses with 361 people.\n\nHarm Reduction Circle heads to music festivals across the country and offers thousands of doses naloxone, fentanyl test strips and other supplies. Attendees of EDC can ask volunteers for supplies and instructions on how to use Narcan or test strips.\n\n“I like to compare it with CPR. 51% of Americans have been trained on CPR at some point in their life. You learn CPR to facilitate the people around you. Same thing with carrying Naloxone,” said founder Annastasia Rose Beal.\n\n“Harm reduction is even more important this year than ever. We’ve seen more than 140,000 overdoses this year in the US. And it’s not just impacting opiate users. It’s impacting non opiate users, people that are doing party drugs like cocaine and ecstasy, and buying fake pressed pills. Attendees might find a dealer on the street or wherever they got their substances from. Now there’s fentanyl in it and they had no idea,” Beal said.\n\nThe Southern Nevada Health District is tracking and monitoring locations of overdoses and deaths, and will distribute harm reduction supplies and kits to people on the streets or partner organizations.\n\nThe data was included in a report from SNHD.\n\n“Fentanyl is primarily driving our overdoses or fatal overdoses in Clark County. We’re also seeing an alarming trend of fentanyl being adulterated into stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine. That suggests that there are people who are using fentanyl who don’t know that that’s what’s in their supply. There’s an ever-evolving illicit drug supply,” said Jessica Johnson, a SNHD health education supervisor.\n\nThrough more funding, SNHD was able to ramp up its Narcan distribution and gave out 11,000 doses in January alone. Distribution happens through partner organizations or even through handing out supplies to people on the streets.\n\nHarm Reduction Circle will be in the Valley all EDC weekend. You can contact them at 949-659-8180 or via direct message on Instagram.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU. All rights reserved.",

        "content": "RENO, Nev. (AP) - A conservative activist who embraced unproven election fraud claims has lost an appeal to the Nevada Supreme Court in his bid to oust a top county election official and others.\n\nThe high court on Wednesday upheld a lower-court judge’s earlier dismissal of Robert Beadles’ lawsuit, which claimed that Washoe County’s registrar of voters, the county manager and a county commissioner violated the state constitution by failing to respond to his complaints of fraud.\n\n“Taking all the factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing every inference in favor of Beadles, he can prove no set facts that would entitle him to relief as pleaded,” the Supreme Court ruled.\n\nBeadles, who once briefly ran for Congress in California in 2010, has alleged that the election system is rife with “flaws and irregularities” that robbed him of his vote in 2020.\n\nBeadles lost an earlier lawsuit in state court in 2022 that sought heightened observation of Washoe County’s vote-counting process. He has helped lead attempts to recall or otherwise oust numerous county officials since he moved to Reno from California in 2019.\n\nWashoe County, which includes Reno-Sparks and the north shore of Lake Tahoe along the California line, is considered a swing county in the Western battleground state of Nevada. Registered voters are divided roughly in equal thirds among Democrats, Republicans and nonpartisans.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s ruling said Beadles misapplied a section of the Nevada Constitution guaranteeing the right to assemble and petition the Legislature in his most recent lawsuit, which sought the removal of Jamie Rodriguez, then-Washoe County registrar of voters; Eric Brown, county manager; and Alexis Hill, county commission chairwoman.\n\n“There are no set of facts that could prove a violation of that constitutional right based on respondents’ failure to respond directly to Beadles’ allegations,” Chief Justice Lidia Stiglich wrote in the five-page ruling.\n\nThe ruling said state law permits a voter to file a complaint with the secretary of state’s office about election practices, but “these laws do not establish that respondents had a duty to respond to Beadles’ allegations.”\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Deacon Tom tells us, they’re taken care of too.\n\n“We also provide free pet food, so if a client has a pet, and the pet’s a family member like my dog’s a family member in our house, we’re providing for the pet too, and the client is just as thankful, even more thankful, for the pet food because it’s caring for their family member.”\n\nCatholic Charities also helps keep families’ cupboards full.\n\n“We also have a food pantry, that is serving people, the working poor, people who just aren’t making enough to make ends meet, and we serve about 150 families a day.”\n\nThe dining hall has long been a gathering place for those in need to get a hot, delicious meal.(Courtesy: Catholic Charities of Southern Nevada)\n\nAnd the group fills the stomachs of those who may not have a kitchen, let alone a cupboard.\n\n“Every day we provide a fresh, hot meal to anyone who needs it, and typically that can be over 500 families a day, 500 individuals and families, “ says Deacon Tom. “They’re coming for a free meal, because they have no place else to go.”\n\nAnd, he says, everyone is welcome.\n\n“I like to say we don’t check religious ID cards around here, so all God’s children are welcome for food, and resources. We’re here to help, we’re not here to judge,” he says.\n\n“It’s a meal delivered with compassion. It’s a high-quality meal, it tastes good. And we have volunteers every day to help us deliver that meal to the clients. So the food is the help and the service is the hope.”\n\nDeacon Tom says it’s been a worthy mission for decades, and it will continue to be so well into the future.\n\n“We’ve been doing this meal for more than 50 years, every single, never missed a day, and that’s God’s grace, that’s the generosity of this community that allows us to do this work, so it’s humbling for me, and I’m grateful and say thank you.”\n\nHe invites not only those in need to visit Catholic Charities but the general public as well.\n\n“I invite people to come and see for yourselves, take a tour, sign up on our website, and come and take a look for yourself so you can see God’s vulnerable children are getting help and hope here.”\n\nYou can sign up for a tour, make a contribution, or learn more about the services offered on Catholic Community Services of Southern Nevada’s website.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

In the video, Westover appears to yell in a tightly-swaddled child’s face, before slamming the child into a bed or cot face down. Then, Westover can be heard saying, “I just body slammed you.”\n\nThe mother of that child, Elisa Valdez, told FOX5 she was horrified when she saw the video.\n\n“Angry at first, extremely angry. I mean who would do that to a three year old?,” Valdez questioned. Valdez stated she confronted the head of the academy, but he gave no apology and showed no remorse.\n\n“He basically said ‘she didn’t really do anything.’ I don’t know how anybody could watch the video and say that and think that nothing happened,” Valdez asserted.\n\nShaylyn Mandado, who worked with Westover at Shenker Academy for three years, says she started noticing abuse last summer, but it escalated in the last couple of months.\n\n“It kind of escalated really fast, where she got really, really, rough with the kids… and then, when we tried to mention it to our higher ups, they kind of dismissed us,” Mandado recounted.\n\nShenker Academy’s attorney said as of Friday, their only comment is that Westover is no longer employed at the school. They did not specifically address the allegations.\n\nFOX5 obtained a letter sent to Shenker Academy parents Friday that stated, in part, “the teacher was placed on administrative leave immediately after the board was notified of these accusations…the safety and well-being of our students is our highest priority.”\n\nAnyone with any information about this incident or knows of other victims is urged by police to contact the LVMPD Abuse Neglect Section by phone at 702-828-3364, or by email at abuseneglectreporting@lvmpd.com.

(FOX5) - In response to the rising number of complaints about residential solar companies, the Nevada State Contractors Board has announced the launch of a special Solar Investigations Unit.\n\nAccording to officials, the unit will aim to target solar companies with complaints “involving theft, fraud, abandonment, diversion of funds, and unlicensed contracting.”\n\n“Of the 3,000 complaints the Board receives annually, nearly one-third are homeowner complaints about solar companies,” said Nevada State Contractors Board Executive Officer Margi Grein. “Complaints include misleading sales tactics with promised benefits such as rebates, government incentives, and the complete eradication of electric bills.”\n\nIn April, FOX5 reported on one contractor accused of stealing around $250,000 without performing any work over the past two years. The 43-year-old man is facing seven felony counts and one misdemeanor as a result, which may involve up to 65 years in prison.\n\nThis is the latest effort from the contractors board to hold companies that have harmed homeowners accountable.\n\nAdditionally, the board will be partnering with prosecutorial agencies to provide increased consumer protection against scams, deceptive loans, and aggressive sales tactics. The unit will also meet regularly with state agencies to collaboratively work toward finding “fair and effective solutions,” according to the board.\n\n“We are sending a message to the residential solar industry that protecting consumers is at the forefront of our mission and we will take whatever measures are necessary to continue protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the public,” said Grein.\n\nHomeowner workshops will also be held to provide homeowners with information and education on how to identify licensed contractors, red flags that may indicate scams, and how to apply for the Residential Recovery Fund.\n\nHomeowners can easily verify a contractor’s license by visiting the NSCB website at www.nscb.nv.gov to ensure that the contractor is licensed for the work to be performed.\n\nFor more information on the NSCB Solar Investigations Unit or to file a complaint, homeowners should contact the NSCB at (702) 486-1100 (Southern Nevada) or (775) 688-1141 (Northern Nevada).\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

(FOX5) - A “Master Plan” is being developed for the site of the former Tropicana Hotel to better integrate a baseball stadium and forthcoming resort, according to the chairman of Bally’s Corporation, which could change the placement of both attractions on the property and centralize a ballpark.\n\nThe 36-acre portion of land at the corner of Tropicana Avenue and Las Vegas Boulevard is owned by GLPI, which offered nine acres to the Athletics for stadium development, leaving 27 acres for a future Bally’s property. GLPI and Bally’s committed the southeast corner of the property for stadium development.\n\nAccording to Chairman Soo Kim, plans are in the works to create more synergy with a ballpark, a resort and the Strip. Kim met with FOX5 in the Las Vegas Valley to discuss developments.\n\n“Our initial plan was to set the stadium back and leave the rest of the site open to development,” he said. “There is a prevailing thought that maybe we should explore putting it more centrally,” Kim said.\n\nA potential centralized stadium location will, in turn, impact pedestrian and vehicle access for both the ballpark and resort, spurring the need for a cohesive Master Plan. The plan will require coordination with neighboring properties as well, he said.\n\n“There’s an opportunity to offer the patrons more integration, and in that way, make the rest of the remaining acreage more valuable. Great sporting experiences are shared outside the arena, whether it’s the walk, or the concourses, or the energy outside the stadium,” Kim said.\n\n“Modern arena design is what happens outside the stadium. That energy is the way to go,” Kim said. “I think the stadium Is going to be an amazing amenity for the city, for tourism and the community. It’s on us to bring a resort to life that’s as exciting as [John] Fisher’s plan for the stadium,” he said.\n\nThough a representative on a recent Bally’s earnings call indicated that the operator could take time to develop a new resort, Kim said that executives are exploring the possibility of building “simultaneously” alongside stadium construction.\n\n“There’s a lot of work being done. There’s a lot of important decisions we’re trying to make. We had a simple solution early, and now we’re trying to come up with an optimal solution,” he said, saying that members of the Las Vegas Valley community will be pleased with the future results after years of planning and construction.\n\nRepresentatives of the Athletics, LVCVA and Stadium Authority have said construction could start in spring of 2025 and be ready by spring of 2028.\n\nThe company will be “fiscally prudent” as it decides on a construction timeline. he said. Although construction could commence simultaneously, Kim said completion of the entire resort could occur in stages after the stadium’s 2028 opening day.\n\nAlthough Kim previously discussed in 2023 a focus on a “sports” theme for a future property, he said the priority has been to finalize the Master Plan.\n\nDemolition of the Tropicana Hotel is on time and on schedule with an implosion planned for October or even September, he said, all to deliver a site ready for the Athletics to commence stadium construction.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

        "content": "LAS VEGAS, Nev. (FOX5) - Is East Las Vegas more impacted by air pollution than other areas of the valley? That is the question researchers set to answer. They equipped street vendors with mobile air monitors for an EPA funded study, and also placed monitors in homes and businesses throughout the community.\n\nWorking on the streets, vendors are exposed to a lot of street traffic every day and extreme heat in the summer. In East Las Vegas, there’s not a lot of green space as compared to other parts of the Vegas Valley. That is why East Las Vegas community members, leaders, and advocates are all coming together.\n\n“It is important for all of us to have access to clean air… this community has one of the worst air quality metrics in the region... Things like respiratory disease, asthma, all of those things are exacerbated by poor air quality,” shared Lauren Boitel, Executive Director of Impact NV.\n\n“Buen Aire Para Todos” or good air for all, is a two-year study on air quality in East Las Vegas paid for by EPA grant money.\n\n“We did 20 indoor sensors, 20 outdoor quality sensors, and 20 mobile sensors on street vendors,” explained Boitel. The air quality monitors were placed in homes, in apartment complexes, and even on the carts of street food vendors like Eduardo Moreno who spoke to FOX5 via translator.\n\n“He decided to participate in this study to be more aware of the air quality where he works at during the day... Thanks to the mobile monitors, he has been able to see air quality is good in the morning and then later on in the day is when the air quality worsens,” the translator relayed.\n\nThe device shows the vendors a color in real time: green being good, red being bad.\n\n“Each device picks up the amount of particulate matter in a home or outside in real time and it shows up on a map... It will help us make recommendations for what the city can do,” Boitel reported.\n\nThe study ended on April 30th and results are still being complied, but preliminary results confirm the air in East Las Vegas is worse than other parts of the Las Vegas Valley. Scientific findings, as well as the feedback of those who took part in the study, will be submitted to the City of Las Vegas in the next month.\n\nThe study is a collaborative effort of Make the Road Nevada, Impact NV, Desert Research Institute, and the City of Las Vegas.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

        "content": "LAS VEGAS, Nev. (FOX5) - Nevada State Education Association representatives shared strong opposition to the Oakland Athletics’ stadium plan for the south end of the Strip during a Las Vegas Stadium Authority meeting Thursday.\n\n“We’ve spent more time implementing a world class stadium than we have working to build a world class K-12 education system,” Alexander Marks, representing NSEA, lamented after the meeting. “We’re 48th in the nation, we’ve got the largest class sizes in the nation, and we’ve got the highest vacancy rates. When our politicians get distracted by shiny objects like stadiums, those issues fall by the wayside.”\n\nMarks was one of two NSEA members who spoke out against the plans for the ballpark, which will cost an estimated $1.5 billion, $380 million of which will come from a combination of state and county help.\n\nThe board held a couple of votes on the park, one of which acknowledged that Major League Baseball team owners have given their blessing for the A’s to move to Las Vegas. The other recognized that the A’s themselves are committed to moving here.\n\nThe board workshopped a non-relocation agreement that would keep the A’s legally bound to Las Vegas until at least 2051, and will vote on it at a later meeting.\n\nMonday, the Nevada Supreme Court rejected a bid by Schools over Stadiums, with whom NSEA is affiliated. The group wanted to put stadium funding on the ballot and let voters have a say. It opposes Nevada tax dollars being used to build a stadium, and is vowing to renew its fight in 2026.\n\n“When we ask for a 20% salary increase and they tell us that’s too expensive, or when we ask for class size reduction measures and we’re told that’s too expensive, and then they turn around and give a billionaire $380 million in public money, that offends everybody,” Marks told FOX5.\n\nThe state legislature did set aside $250 million for teacher pay raises, although a similarly-priced class size reduction bill did not pass.\n\nAt the tail end of this meeting, the board also received a report on the revenue brought in by Allegiant Stadium. It showed about a 13% boost, thanks in large part to hosting the Super Bowl.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU. All rights reserved.",

(FOX5) - “This is probably the first time to our knowledge that a program like this has been deployed in an urban city looking at storm drains where individuals are living in these areas,” said Edwin Oh, Ph.D., associate professor at the UNLV School of Medicine.\n\nA first-of-its-kind study years in the making at UNLV, in partnerships with the Southern Nevada Health District, Water Authority, and others, showed video of wastewater collection, stating, “Typically, this is what wastewater from the Strip might look like in a manhole.”\n\nIt all started with wastewater surveillance in 2020, looking for the pathogen that causes COVID-19.\n\nShowing a water sample, Oh said, “That will represent about 12 hours of waste that’s coming from the airport that’s collected every 5 minutes so as to give us a composite sample of both locals and tourists.”\n\nDr. Edwin Oh and his team soon realized if they could identify these pathogens in wastewater, maybe they could use the same method to study the water in the Las Vegas flood control channels.\n\n“This is the flow that we’re talking about. There really, really isn’t much water there.” Oh added, “We didn’t think that this was going to work, and surprisingly enough, this sample here contained DNA, RNA that allowed us to get a better sense of variants that were present.”\n\nWater samples were collected weekly from channels like the Flamingo and Tropicana Washes, the same tunnels where more than a thousand unhoused people are known to live.\n\n“The challenge with unsheltered homelessness in a city like ours is only growing. We’re talking about thousands of people who are living in these tunnels, and therefore, there are potentially thousands of people who don’t have access to healthcare resources,” Oh said.\n\nDr. Oh says it’s a population that’s underserved in healthcare and underrepresented in medical studies.\n\n“We don’t have much data about testing and vaccination of unsheltered individuals,” Oh mentioned. “Using this source of water, we’re able to track how much of this pathogen might be present in a community that typically doesn’t get tested.”\n\nResearchers not only found SARS-CoV-2 in the samples, fluctuating over a span of seven months, but could also identify variants in the water.\n\n“The data suggests that by monitoring these storm tunnels, researchers can find times in the year when they see spikes in the viral pathogens,” Oh explained. “When we see these spikes, we can then deploy resources that are usually limited. To provide a choice for the community there to decide whether they would want to be tested, whether they would want to be vaccinated.”\n\nDoctor Oh now hopes to further develop this method to identify other health trends in storm drain water samples.\n\n“To look for influenza, to look for chlamydia, to look for Candida auris, to look for a number of different pathogens which could be treatable, and there could be a vaccine that’s available,” Oh said.\n\nAnd he foresees other big cities adopting the same method, replicating the same DNA of this groundbreaking research.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

        "content": "LAS VEGAS, Nev. (FOX5) -They were delayed for months, but now some wrong-way driver alert signs are operational around the Las Vegas Valley.\n\n“The system is functional to the point where when somebody drives the wrong way entering the freeway at one of those four interchanges, it triggers the system, sets off the flashing beacons that are designed to alert drivers to turn around before they enter the freeway,” said Justin Hopkins with NDOT.\n\nThe flashing wrong-way warning signs are located at Starr Avenue and I-15, Skye and Kyle Canyon and Durango at U.S. 95. The Durango location has been operational for a while as part of an initial three-year pilot program.\n\nNDOT believes some wrong-way warning signs for drivers have saved lives.\n\nThat pilot program, conducted with signs mostly in Northern Nevada, had impressive results. NDOT says nearly 90 percent of drivers who encountered the signs stopped, turned around and never made it onto a highway in the wrong direction.\n\nHopkins says impaired and distracted driving are the main reasons for wrong-way driving crashes.\n\n“What we really want to do is have these systems in place so they can get people’s attention and hopefully correct their bad decisions, correct their bad behavior, correct them from getting on the freeway in the wrong direction before they ever enter the main line,” said Hopkins.\n\nIf a car still ends up making it onto a highway in the wrong direction, an automatic alert is generated at a traffic management center, as is video of the vehicle. Hopkins says officials can then track the car with traffic cameras and let law enforcement know where it is, so they can stop the vehicle.\n\nOne eventual goal is to alert the public on highway traffic signs that a wrong-way driver may be coming their way.\n\nHopkins says more wrong-way driver alert sign systems are coming to the valley but says they may not know where they will be located for another six months or so.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

Kahn, the dean of the Kirk Kerkorian School of Medicine at UNLV.\n\nThe state has three medical schools.\n\nTotal Number of Medical School Graduates\t2024\nUNLV\t66\nUNR\t69\nTouro University Nevada\t157\n\nDr. Kahn says cites several reasons behind the shortage.\n\n“One is to grow our own, need to have more medical students, but more importantly we need to have more residency positions, second thing is we need to make it easier for fully credentialed physicians to come into the state,” he said.\n\nIn order to become a licensed doctor you have to complete a residency or post-graduate training which is typically between 3-5 years after medical school. Statistically, where you do your residency is where you’ll end up practicing.\n\n“I think it is important for me to stay, for my own health, try to get a doctor’s appointment, how long it took, I could see how the need is so large here, and I really want to pioneer that and get more help, doctors here,” said Megan Sherman, a first year student at UNLV”s medical school.\n\nBut some students will have to leave the state because of their specialty.\n\n“Residency positions in large part funded by the federal government through the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Nevada has about 404 funded positions compared to California that is over 9,000,” Dr. Kahn said.\n\nThere are also caps on Medicare funding imposed in 1997, but in 2021 Congress approved an additional 1,000 funded slots over five years starting in 2023, however many of those positions will go to large metropolitan areas where the cost of living is high.\n\nUNLV is working with the Governor Lombardo to fund more residency positions, and is also looking to hire 80 new positions at its medical school to help expand class sizes in the near future.\n\nThe U.S. will face a physician shortage of up to 86,000 physicians by 2036, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Your wallet may soon be getting thinner.\n\nVisa on Wednesday announced major changes to how credit and debit cards will operate in the U.S. in the coming months and years.\n\nThe new features could mean Americans will be carrying fewer physical cards in their wallets, and will make the 16-digit credit or debit card number printed on every card increasingly irrelevant.\n\nThey will be some of the biggest changes to how payments operate in the U.S. since the U.S. rolled out chip-embedded cards several years ago. They also come as Americans have many more options to pay for purchases beyond “credit or debit,” including buy now, pay later companies, peer-to-peer payment options, paying directly with a bank, or digital payment systems like Apple Pay.\n\n“I think (with these features) we’re getting past the point where consumers may never need to manually enter an account number ever again,” said Mark Nelsen, Visa’s global head of consumer payments, in an interview.\n\nThe biggest change coming for Americans will be the ability for banks to issue one physical payment card that will be connected to multiple bank accounts. That means no more carrying, for example, a Bank of America or Chase debit card as well as their respective credit cards in a physical wallet. Americans will be able to set criteria with their bank — such as having all purchases below $100 or with a certain merchant applied to the debit card, while other purchases go on the credit card.\n\nThe feature, already being used in Asia, will be available this summer. Buy now, pay later company Affirm is the first of Visa’s customers to roll out the feature in the U.S.\n\nSome of Visa’s new features are in response to online-payments fraud, which continues to increase as more countries adopt digital payments. The San Francisco-based company estimates that payment fraud happens roughly seven times more often online than it does in person, and there are now billions of stolen credit and debit card numbers available to criminals.\n\nOther new elements are also in response to features that non-payments companies have rolled out in recent years. The Apple Card, which uses Mastercard as its payment network, does not come with a printed 16-digit account number and Apple Card users can request a fresh credit card number at any time without having to dispose of the physical card.\n\nVisa executives see a future where banks will issue cards where the 16-digit account number, if the new cards come with them, is largely symbolic.\n\nAmong the other updates unveiled by Visa are changes to tap-to-pay features. Americans will be able to tap their credit or debit cards to their smartphones to add the card to mobile wallets, instead of using a smartphone’s camera to scan in a card’s information, or tap the card to their smartphones to approve a transaction online. Visa will also start implementing biometrics to approve transactions, similar to how Apple devices use a fingerprint or face scan to approve transactions.\n\nThe features will take time to filter down to the banks, which will decide when or what to implement for their customers. But since the banks and credit card companies are Visa’s customers, and issue cards with the Visa label, these are features that the financial institutions have been asking for.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Officials say the individual called the tip line provided and stated that this was “done during a time of desperation while being deeply stuck in the mud.”\n\nThe individual added that it was never their intention to harm the tower. Park officials say they will not disclose any further information about the individual.\n\n“We are grateful to the dozens of people who reached out to the park with information and for all the statements of support that we received from people who care about this place and its cultural resources,” said acting Superintendent Elizabeth Ibañez. “Although we would certainly prefer that this damage hadn’t happened, we are glad that the person who did this ultimately took responsibility for their actions and came forward.”\n\nCrews are working to assess the tower’s damage and make plans to restore to tower. Park officials remind the public that patience is key during the repair process, as “repairs done by well-intentioned people who don’t have the proper tools and training can do additional damage.”\n\nIn the meantime, officials are reminding those traveling through the park to carry a satellite-based communication device in areas where cell coverage may be spotty. Additionally, park-goers are reminded to stay on paved roads as temperatures continue to climb.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU. All rights reserved.",

She saw the need for basic necessities, and her team and mission has expanded to provide essentials in Los Angeles and cities like San Diego, Sacramento and Las Vegas, all seeing a surge in people who are homeless or in need of social services.\n\n“This just used to be my party city like everybody else.

You guys have a lot of youth out here that’s homeless,” she said.\n\nThough every city has resources and social services, Raines notices a common theme: many people don’t have access or do not know where to go. From families to individuals, those who lost their homes or need emergency help in a crisis often can’t find a rapid resource or a way to get to a location for aid.\n\n“Each city does provide resources. Are they achievable resources? No, not at that stage. I’m not saying resources are not out there. I’m saying it’s not realistic.

        "content": "LAS VEGAS, Nev. (FOX5) -Henderson, the second largest city in Nevada, is often overshadowed by the bright lights of Las Vegas, but now it is putting its own history in the spotlight.\n\nThe City of Henderson is offering a historic walking tour on Water Street using the technology of today to showcase it’s past.\n\n“We are really trying to take residents and visitors on a walk down memory lane,” shared Tiffany Reardon, Redevelopment Communications Specialist for the City of Henderson.\n\nHenderson was officially incorporated on April 16, 1953. Now seven decades later, as the population continues to boom, the city’s Historical Walking Tour focuses on those early days in the 50′s and 60′s. With the scan of a QR code, you can transport back in time.\n\nThe La Porta building at the corner of Water and Army, once home to the insurance agency of one of Henderson’s first city councilmen, is now home to the Purple Penguin and a number of other businesses.\n\n“I am a fourth generation Henderson native... I actually grew up here in the Townsite area and Water Street has always been the center of activity for me,” Reardon explained. Reardon knows the history of Henderson well.\n\n“Henderson has such a rich history that we are not sure all the new residents are aware of. It was formed in America’s defense during WWII. The Basic Magnesium Incorporated plant was actually the world’s largest producer of magnesium ingots that were used for munitions,” Reardon explained. The plant brought 15,000 people who established the Basic Townsite.\n\n“They thought it was going to be temporary and they didn’t expect to stay here but they got here and then they loved it,” Reardon recounted. During the war, women stepped up to work in the plant.\n\n“Behind me is the statue of Magnesium Maggie. Magnesium Maggie is Henderson’s version of Rosie the Riveter... Basic Magnesium was really setting a precedent and they were giving women equal pay for equal work which was sort of unheard of at the time,” Reardon reported.\n\nBasic Magnesium, integral to the founding of the city, is also how Water Street got its name.\n\n“Water Street is called Water Street because there is a large water main that run right down the street and it fed water to the industrial plants,” Reardon revealed.\n\nThe city also offers the tour virtually with stories at each stop recorded by major figures in Henderson. You can also download a map before taking the tour on the city’s website.\n\nhttps://www.cityofhenderson.com/government/departments/mayor-and-council/our-history\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

Charleston know how tough it’s been for the public not to hike the very popular Mary Jane Falls trail.\n\n“It was almost like they lost a family member,” said Ray Johnson with the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest.\n\nHeavy flooding from the remnants of tropical storm Hilary last year washed away part of the trail. A wall of water 300 feet wide left trees, tree roots and rocks scattered all over.\n\n“The sides can cave in. The footing is unsure. Any type of rescue type of event is then putting the rescuers at risk as well. So, for the time being, it’s very clear why these trails are closed,” said Johnson.\n\nFOX5 got an escorted tour of the Mary Jane Falls trail this week. Officials want people to see the condition of the trail, so they don’t try to hike it. The trail is closed, and anyone found on it could face a fine up to $5,000.\n\nBut during our tour, FOX5 saw nine people who were hiking the closed trail. Some said they saw “road closed” signs but walked into the trail anyway. One person, in a group of four people who walked through some large orange barriers, along with a large road closed sign, said he didn’t see the sign.\n\nIt's due to the damage inflicted by Hurricane Hilary last year.\n\nOfficials say hikers on the closed trail can cause some big problems if they have to be rescued. Fire officials on Mt. Charleston said a rescue could draw resources away from other emergencies on the mountain, such as a fire or car accident. They say they can call Las Vegas for backup but it would take those crews a minimum of 40 minutes to get up the mountain.\n\nForest officials talked to all nine people who were on the closed trail but didn’t cite any of them.\n\n“We’re using some of these efforts for education over citations. However, that doesn’t mean that people won’t get citations if they’re up here,” said Johnson.\n\nNational Forest officials say the closures of the Mary Jane, Cathedral Rock and Bristol Cone trails make up a very small portion of the mountain. They say 99 percent of the mountain remains open and they encourage people to take advantage of the many other trails available.\n\nThey also urge hikers not to wear flip-flops while hiking because of the risk of slip and fall injuries. And they tell people to be prepared for hikes by taking extra clothing for sudden changes in the weather.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU. All rights reserved.",

(FOX5) - Community Ambulance has more resources on the road than ever before, just in time for EDC at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway.\n\n“Community Ambulance has been providing medical services for this event since 2016, and once again we’re gearing up for well over 170,000 attendees, including the staff that will be out there,” said Glen Simpson, senior director of Community Ambulance. “We’re building an entire medical infrastructure out there to be able to support this small community that will fill in the speedway over the next several days.”\n\nSince last year’s festival, Simpson says Community Ambulance has added 150 staff to their lineup and more than a dozen trucks to their fleet.\n\nThey’ve also changed how they deploy those resources, thanks in part to lessons learned during Formula One and the Super Bowl.\n\n“Typically, we’d put a lot of people on ambulances and send them out there,” said Simpson. “We’ve refined that process, so a lot of our providers will end up going out on shuttles that we’ve chartered.”\n\nThis strategy is to help ensure that the event itself is fully staffed, but they also have enough ambulances on hand to respond to other calls throughout the city.\n\nSimpson says last year, thousands of people came through the medical tents at EDC, but only about two dozen had to be transported to hospitals, as most were treated on site.\n\n“So, if you really look at 175,000, 180,000 people, 24 transports - clearly, what we’re doing and the infrastructure that we’re building is working, meaning that we’re not impacting our community resources, we’re not impacting our already very busy hospitals,” said Simpson.\n\nThis year, he says the heat is their biggest concern.\n\n“As we walk into a warmer weekend, especially Thursday/Friday, we’re already making adjustments to our plan, and we’re adding some more staff to be able to support the anticipated high temperatures that we’re going to experience,” said Simpson. “Once you’re outside, once you’re on blacktop, that temperature only amplifies.”\n\nAlthough heat is still a concern this year, it’s less of a problem than in years past. The event used to be held in June during peak summer temperatures but was moved to May for the cooler temperatures. Since the move, there have been no major heat-related incidents.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU. All rights reserved.",

        "content": "LAS VEGAS, Nev. (FOX5) - In life, we can sometimes take the little things for granted such as having the ability to walk outside or being able to rest when our body needs to.\n\nHowever, for one little boy in the Las Vegas area, those normal things come as a challenge.\n\nCarter is 7-years-old and is your average kid. FOX5 was able to spend an afternoon with Carter to get to know his personality and how he is dealing with the rare skin condition that he was born with.\n\nWe soon realized, even though this little boy has a lot on his plate, he stronger than many of us.\n\n“My skin was hurting super bad when I woke up,” Carter said.\n\nCarter was born with two rare skin conditions called lamellar ichthyosis and ectropion. He was diagnosed with autism later.\n\n“His body over produces skin at rapid rate but his skin cell turnover isn’t up to par to release the dead skin cells,” his mom Shai Bresee said.\n\nCarter’s skin condition is far beyond just severe dry skin, his mom tells FOX5 she has to moisturize Carter up to seven times a day with special products.\n\n“We have to be very careful because we can cause more damage than good over exfoliating,” Bresee said.\n\nEven if his skin is soothed, Carter has another challenge that his mom can’t make better.\n\nGofundme goal for 7 year old dealing with rare skin condition doubles in 24 hours\n\n“His skin is so dry and tight that it pulls his upper lids basically flat,” Bresee said.\n\nCarter has not been able to close his eye lids since he was born. He has to sleep with his eyes open.\n\n“Why does such a great kid have to go through all of these every day struggles just to experience these normal day to day things,” Bresee said.\n\nThis summer Carter will get a skin graft surgery on his eye lids so he can hopefully close them for the very first time.\n\n“I’m going through a lot. It hurts, but I have to go through it until I get surgery and then it won’t really hurt anymore.” Carter said.\n\nFor it to not hurt anymore, the family will have to travel to San Diego for surgery, but it will get costly for the family which is why they are asking for help through this GoFundMe.\n\n“He will struggle no matter what we do so all we can do is help him struggle with less things,” Bresee said.\n\nEven through all the pain, Carter is still your every day kid. He tells FOX5, he likes to play video games, watch the Vegas Golden Knights and chill at home.\n\nWhen we told him he is like a real life super hero with how strong he is, he agreed.\n\nCarter’s condition makes his skin so sensitive it is hard to play in the park like the other kids, and when he does he has to wear a cooling vest.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

A Spanish native hailing from Madrid, Chef Serrano helped usher in the evolution of Las Vegas as a fine dining destination with the opening of Picasso in 1998.\n\nDuring its 25-year tenure, Picasso earned some of the industry’s top culinary honors, including becoming the first Las Vegas restaurant to receive a James Beard Award nomination for Best New Restaurant, one of the first two Nevada restaurants to receive the Forbes Five-Star Award, and one of only two restaurants in the city to receive two Michelin stars. Chef Serrano himself earned two regional “Best Chef” awards from the James Beard Foundation during his impressive culinary career.\n\nIn addition to its exquisite cuisine, the intimate restaurant was known for the authentic Picasso artwork adorning its walls and its spectacular views of the Bellagio fountains. It served as a filming location for 2001′s Ocean’s 11 starring George Clooney and Julia Roberts.\n\nFountain view tables at Picasso at the Bellagio in Las Vegas(MGM Resorts International)\n\n“I want to thank the team at MGM Resorts, who I have collaborated with over these 25 years to create something truly special at Picasso,” said Chef Serrano. “From our front of house staff to our wonderful chefs and the executive team, none of this would have been possible without everyone’s immense talents coming together. I’m forever grateful to everyone who contributed to making memories every night at Picasso.”\n\nBellagio’s President & COO Ann Hoff said, “As Chef Serrano embarks on this well-deserved retirement, we reflect on the remarkable 25-year journey of Picasso, a cornerstone of culinary excellence at Bellagio. His artistry has left an indelible mark on our guests and the Las Vegas dining scene. While we bid a very fond farewell to Picasso and the stellar team who provided unmatched hospitality to our guests for decades, we celebrate its enduring legacy and Chef Serrano’s immeasurable contributions to our culinary landscape.”\n\nThough Chef Serrano has stepped away from oversight of Lago’s kitchen, the restaurant remains open and continues to serve guests its renowned coastal Italian cuisine. He remains at the helm of Julian Serrano Tapas at ARIA Resort & Casino.\n\nBellagio said it plans to provide details on “an exciting addition” to its culinary portfolio in the coming months.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

The mop bucket was then observed being picked up by another inmate.\n\nThe informant confirmed to investigators that the compromised officer was LaWayne Hardiman. The informant also revealed Hardiman’s CashApp accounts, and that he would meet families of inmates at a Walgreens on Blue Diamond Road and Decatur Boulevard.\n\nInvestigators secured a warrant for the CashApp accounts and confirmed that $28,110 was sent from inmates or people associated with inmates. One transaction appeared to show an active account from a current inmate at NDOC, though the inmate would later reveal that he allowed his information to be used by a different inmate to open the account.\n\nA search warrant was also obtained for Hardiman’s person, vehicle, and residence. Investigators would make contact with Hardiman as he arrived for work at 5:00 a.m., and interviewed with him.\n\nHardiman would tell police that he received money from the families of inmates, but never the inmates themselves. When confronted with the number of transactions, he would further admit that he was “a good sports bettor” and would place wagers for inmates, then receive a portion of any winnings.\n\nHardiman was placed under arrest following the interview.\n\nA search of Hardiman’s residence would yield several phones “packaged in a way that was familiar to investigators as being introduced to a State prison,” along with several similar packages with vape pens, brown and green leafy substances, a small package of what appeared to be methamphetamine.\n\nIn a follow-up interview, Hardiman admitted that he had “met with someone” and planned to “smuggle the packages into SDCC.”\n\nA representative from NDOC tells FOX5 that Hardiman was originally employed by the Nevada Department of Corrections as a Correctional Officer Trainee in December 2020 and resigned in February 2022.  He was reinstated as an officer on Oct. 16, 2023, with a one-year probationary period.\n\nHe was terminated from his employment on Tuesday.\n\nHardiman is facing two counts of accepting a bribe as a public official and six counts of attempting to furnish a portable telecommunication device.\n\nHe is due in court for an initial appearance on Wednesday, May 15.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

Also, we are grateful to MGM for assisting with our transition.”\n\n“While we pause for the incredible transformation of this iconic property, I’d like to thank all team members at The Mirage for their incredible commitment and helping us provide memorable experiences for our guests,” said Joe Lupo, President of The Mirage. “We are planning to host collaborative hiring events with other employers in the Las Vegas community over the coming months. Connecting the thousands of talented Mirage team members who provide outstanding service with new employment opportunities is a top priority.”\n\nMirage employees who spoke with FOX5 say they’ll miss the property. A former executive with The Mirage echoed that sentiment.\n\n“We knew we had something special with the Mirage, and it proved to do exactly what we were talking about,” former executive Alan Feldman told FOX5 about the hotel’s opening in 1989. “It really changed the paradigm for the way in which hotels in Las Vegas are designed and presented to the public. The town is forever changed for the better as a result.”\n\nFeldman recognizes the circle of life that dictates change on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\n“As much as I would love for The Mirage to last forever, I’ve got to go back to that fundamental belief that we do well when we’re willing to part with some of the things in the past and try new things,” he said. “Am I sad the volcano is going to go away? Of course. But I’ve got to tell you, I’m pretty excited about a huge guitar-shaped hotel coming right to the Strip. That’s pretty cool.”\n\nHard Rock officials said the new property will double the number of jobs currently available in the Mirage and will offer severance packages for eligible employees.\n\nThe Culinary Union also released a statement following the announcement. Union Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge reiterated that the previously established union contract with the property will continue to protect the workers during the closure, and work to center them in the property’s future.\n\n“Culinary Union contracts include strong language on layoff, recall, seniority, training, and placement so that unionized workers who choose to retain their recall rights and are recalled within 36-months of layoff will have access to free job training and seniority right of first-access to available job openings when the property reopens, and placement into other job opportunities as they are available,” the union stated.\n\n“Culinary Union will also host multiple Rapid Response events for The Mirage workers at the Culinary Academy of Las Vegas to connect workers to unemployment, job fairs, union benefits, and other resources.”\n\nFor more information, visit this website.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

        "content": "LAS VEGAS, Nev. (FOX5) - Crowds showed up to support a plan for a new temple for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as neighbors continue their fierce opposition to the proposal.\n\nThe Las Vegas Planning Commission approved the Site Development Review in a vote of 6 with one abstention, adding conditions to address one aspect of residents’ concerns: before the church moves into the temple, the building must meet lighting standards for the neighborhood and must turn off parking lot lights overnight.\n\nThe project moves forward to a full City Council vote on July 17.\n\nHundreds of church members wore blue shirts and “vote yes” stickers, crowding the steps of Las Vegas City Hall. They also launched a counter-petition drawing close to 10,000 signatures. Church members voiced a need for a second temple on the other side of town; the only temple for 85,000 people lies at the edge of Sunrise Mountain on the far east side.\n\nIn late 2022, church leaders announced plans for a second temple at the 20-acre site off North Grand Canyon Road. City documents stated the height of the steeple would be 216 feet. The temple would be 70,000 square feet and a meeting hall would be 15,000 square feet. Parking would be required to accommodate visitors.\n\n“I know I’m looking forward to it. I live super close to it and I know it would benefit me greatly,” said church member Emma Brummett, who said family members also came to show support. “We can drive a lot quicker and be there more often,” she said.\n\nIn March, the City Council of Las Vegas voted to amend longstanding code in the district, paving the way for houses of worship to apply for a Special Use Permit to build in the area.\n\nSome community members are pushing back against the proposed temple near Lone Mountain.\n\nConcerned Neighbors launched a fierce opposition, created a petition with more than 5,000 signatures and launched a Preserve Rural Las Vegas website. Various neighbors have expressed concerns over traffic and the massive footprint, but many take issue with the height and lighting proposals in a rural area.\n\nLong-time rural zoning restrictions for the Lone Mountain area limit projects with massive footprints and height and lighting restrictions.\n\n“It’s too big and just doesn’t fit into the area,” said concerned neighbor Matt Hackley. “This isn’t an anti-church movement at all. This is simply a grassroots movement of our neighborhood to protect its rural status,” Hackley said.\n\nNeighbors said they had asked for compromises on concerns but church representatives and project officials seemed unwilling to make major amendments.\n\n“The arrogance and unwillingness to compromise in the name of the Lord I feel is unacceptable,” another concerned resident said.\n\nResidents likened the size and bright lights of various temples to “casinos” in a neighborhood.\n\nNumerous residents own and ride horses, and voiced concerns about the safety to continue to do so. Community members are also lobbying Clark County leaders as the project progresses through city and county commissions.\n\nA spokesperson for the project before the planning commission said the temple site is not a place for carnivals or large events. Several weeks ago, FOX5 spoke to church leadership about neighbors’ concerns. FOX5 was told that officials would address concerns— but some designs are intrinsic to their faith.\n\n“Temples are so special, they are so significant. We build them, and then we dedicate them to God, they are literally a house of the Lord. Things like the size and the height of the building are part of the deep religious meaning and symbolism of the building itself,” said Bud Stoddard, stake president of the Lone Mountain Stake, who spoke to FOX5 several weeks ago.\n\nThe City of Las Vegas said the proposed temple will now head to City Council for another full presentation, and then a vote on the project. City documents state as soon as the project is approved, it could be built in 36 months.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU. All rights reserved.",

What’s left of the trails are dangerous to hike.\n\n“We want folks not to go on those trails, \" said Jason Douglas, Mount Charleston’s Fire Protection District Chief.\n\nMt. Charleston locals and tourists debate whether the wild horses on Mt.

Last year, before the trail was washed out, 12 people needed to be rescued at Mary Jane Falls.\n\nAccording to Douglas, a rescue operation now could take as long as four hours. The Spring Mountain National Recreation Area is warning that people caught hiking the trails will be cited.\n\n“If convicted in court, you are facing up to a $5,000 fine,” said Nick Laprade with Forest Service Law Enforcement.\n\nThe bottom line: 99% of the mountain is open and ready for people to enjoy.

        "content": "LAS VEGAS, Nev. (FOX5) - Governor Joe Lombardo sent a letter to California Governor Gavin Newsom, sharing his concerns about the unintended consequences of California’s SBX1-2 legislation, which Lombardo said could further raise gas prices in California, Nevada, and Arizona.\n\n“Since 88 percent of Nevada’s fuels are delivered via pipeline and truck from refineries in California, it’s no surprise that California’s fuel policies significantly impact the costs and availability of fuel for Nevada’s residents and businesses,” Lombardo wrote.\n\n“As my administration has followed this issue, it seems that the new state agency the legislation created is getting closer to announcing a profits cap structure. While we have no details on what this might look like, I’m concerned that this approach could lead to refiners either constraining supplies of fuels to avoid a profit penalty or even leaving our shared fuels market entirely,” he added. “Either scenario would likely lead to limited supplies and higher fuel costs for consumers in both of our states.”\n\n“Should this happen, I am sure Californians and Nevadans would share a demand for answers and relief from higher fuel costs and the impacts those costs could have across the economy.”\n\nGovernor Joe Lombardo, in a letter to California Governor Gavin Newsome\n\n“Before proceeding with a profits cap, I would request an assessment of potential impacts of this approach across the West, including not only California, but Nevada and Arizona too. To assist with this, my Office of Energy stands ready to immediately engage in proactive conversations with the California Energy Commission,” Lombardo added.\n\n“Thank you for your consideration of this request. I’m hopeful that your administration will work to mitigate unintended consequences of SBX1-2, so that we can spare hard working Californians and Nevadans from further pain at the pump,” he wrote in conclusion.\n\nGovernor Lombardo’s letter comes ahead of the California State Assembly Utilities & Energy Committee hearing tomorrow, where the California Energy Commission will update the committee on the implementation of SBX1-2.\n\nOn Tuesday night, a spokesperson from Governor Newsom’s office sent the following statement to FOX5:\n\n“This is a stunt to appease Governor Lombardo’s Big Oil donors, who contributed tens of thousands of dollars to his campaign. He’s parroting their talking points, and he knows full well that oil refiners are driving up gas prices and making massive profits — harming residents of both of our states. Price spikes are profit spikes, and California is holding Big Oil accountable.”\n\nThe statement added that Governor Lombardo took over $40,000 from the oil and gas industry during his campaign.\n\nWednesday, FOX5 was sent a statement from Elizabeth Ray, Spox for Governor Joe Lombardo:\n\n“Governor Lombardo sent his letter to Governor Newsom in good faith to express serious concerns on behalf of millions of hardworking Nevadans currently suffering under inflation and high gas prices. Governor Lombardo isn’t intimidated by baseless attacks, and he’ll always speak up in the best interest of his constituents. Political gamesmanship isn’t the answer to legitimate policy concerns, and Governor Lombardo’s offer to have the Nevada Office of Energy assist the California Energy Commission in understanding the impacts of their policy decisions still stands – though Governor Newsom has no apparent interest in that.”\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

        "content": "LAS VEGAS, Nev. (FOX5) - The Nevada Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the former Las Vegas Raiders head coach cannot sue the NFL and must continue with arbitration.\n\nThe high court threw out a previous ruling on the matter from district court, which denied the NFL’s attempt to compel arbitration.\n\nIn a two-to-one decision, Justices Elissa Cadish and Kristina Pickering ruled that Jon Gruden is subject to a clause in the NFL’s Constitution that gives the commissioner authority over arbitration, as a former employee of the league.\n\nThe Commissioner shall have full, complete, and final jurisdiction and authority to arbitrate:\n\n...Any dispute involving a member or members in the League or any players or employees of the members of the League or any combination thereof that in the opinion of the Commissioner constitutes conduct detrimental to the best interests of the League or professional football.\n\nIn the ruling, the high court notes that Gruden’s argument that an undisclosed settlement from the NFL would have rescinded the employment agreement, and further, its arbitration requirements, but failed to provide evidence on the record.\n\nGruden would also claim in district court that Gruden was not given a copy of the NFL Constitution when he signed the agreement. However, the court found that his contract with the Raiders included a clause legally binding him to the constitution.\n\nGruden’s employment agreement with the Raiders meets these criteria. In it, Gruden agrees to \"abide by and be legally bound by the Constitution, Bylaws, and rules and regulations of the NFL in their present form and as amended from time to time hereafter... which are hereby made a part of this [a]greement.\"\n\nGruden also \"acknowledges that he has read the NFL Constitution and By-Laws and applicable NFL rules and regulations, and understands their meaning.\"\n\nHaving assented to the employment agreement, Gruden cannot now disavow that assent.\n\nIn Justice Linda Bell’s dissenting opinion, she stated that she did not believe the clause should apply to former employees.\n\nIn 2021, Gruden resigned from the Raiders after several racist, homophobic, and misogynistic emails emerged from his time as an ESPN broadcaster. He would go on to file a lawsuit against the NFL a month later, alleging that the league purposefully leaked the emails to force his resignation.\n\nFOX5 has reached out to Gruden’s attorney and the NFL for comments on the Supreme Court’s ruling.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

Sandoval Jr. would then reveal to police that the shooting occurred near St. Louis and 15th Street.\n\nOfficers arriving at the scene around 4:46 a.m. located a deceased female in the driver’s seat of a gray Honda. According to the report, the female had a gunshot wound to the head and would later be declared dead at the scene.\n\nSandoval Jr. would later identify the victim to police as his friend, 18-year-old Jazlynn Johnson. The report notes that Sandoval Jr. reiterated to officers that the shooting “was an accident,” but did not provide further details.\n\nOfficers transported Sandoval Jr. to LVMPD Headquarters for questioning. During the interview, Sandoval Jr. told officers that the shooting was “a [expletive] up accident and I hurt my friend,” but later said he would “rather have my lawyer present.”\n\nHe added, “...But I will say that it was an accident.”\n\nHe also denied knowing where the gun used in the shooting was.\n\nAn interview with his parents would reveal that Sandoval Jr. arrived home “hysterical and in a panic” around 3:00 a.m. According to the report, he hugged his mother while crying and repeating, “It was an accident.”\n\nHis mother would tell officers that he told her “I [expletive] up, I did something wrong. I shot my friend.” He would also ask his parents not to call the police to report the incident, though his brother would tell him “they had to because he had done something wrong,” according to the report.\n\nSandoval Jr. was placed under arrest for open murder, destroying/concealing evidence, and being a minor in possession of a firearm, and was booked into Clark County Juvenile Hall.\n\nHe is due back in court for a preliminary hearing on Wednesday, June 18.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

Also, the enhanced weapon search program that we’ve increased this school year, and again, I can’t say enough about the relationships that we have with our students to feel comfortable to report those incidents each and every school day,” said Chief Blackeye.\n\nChief Blackeye said one major problem that seems to be getting worse is traffic crashes involving student pedestrians around campuses. “Last year, I reported 70 students were struck by vehicles on their way to and from school in the school year,” he said. “Unfortunately, this year, that number is doubled.”\n\nWatch the presser through the media player above.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

        "content": "LAS VEGAS, Nev. (FOX5) - A local restaurateur is making his mark in the Las Vegas valley by turning his ghost kitchen into a restaurant.\n\nTino Rodriguez says the food he creates is “Mexicue,” or a fusion of Mexican ingredients and American barbecue. His restaurant, Humo Barbecue, recently opened in Henderson, but the road to get there included a few stops along the way.\n\nRodriguez spent nearly 20 years cooking barbecue and helping a company open more than a dozen restaurants across the country.\n\n“I opened about 13 restaurants, and it just kind of soared from there in the barbecue industry,” he told FOX5.\n\nAfter that success, Rodriguez was inspired to branch out on his own.\n\n“I was running seven barbecue restaurants and... I felt like I was the owner myself,” he said.\n\nThat led to an opportunity to open up a ghost kitchen in a Henderson bar. “I had a friend that was the owner of Gambit, and he let me know that he had some space at lunchtime ... [so] I could sling some barbecue.”\n\nRodriguez says while he was grateful for the space to work, he quickly realized it wasn’t for him.\n\n“It didn’t work for me... because we were a no-name company, no one really knew us, and I didn’t have a way to get out there,” he shared.\n\nHe says all his previous restaurant and ghost kitchen experiences made the transition smooth when it was time to open Humo Barbecue.\n\n“Having your own space, there’s nothing like it,” he said. “It’s like going from roommates to having your own house or living on your own. There’s nothing that can compare because you just run your own thing.”\n\nWhile the owner and pit master has led his team to where they are today, Rodriguez says social media influencers also helped make this journey possible.\n\n“Our first influencer was Jose the Taco Guy. He came in and I don’t know how he heard about us, somebody told me he was a friend of a friend,” he said. “He came in and put us on social media.”\n\nHe added, “There’s a bunch of influencers out there that did a lot for us and one just piggybacked off the other...”\n\nIf you’d like to give Humo Barbecue a try, it’s located on Sunset between Pecos and Sandhill.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

They wanted to see the Westside,” said Katie Duncan of the Harrison House. The home hosted tourists from decades past like Sammy Davis, Jr. and once listed the home for a stay on Airbnb. Duncan would like to list it again with approval from the city.\n\nSocial media has spurred a trend for Gen Z: venturing into local neighborhoods for authentic cultural experiences, history excursions and street food.\n\n“We believe the whole Westside has that appeal. Young people want to know their history suddenly, and they want good food. And we’ve got both,” Duncan said.\n\nNevada Partners and UNLV are collaborating with Westside residents, businesses and non-profits to boost tourism on the Westside: UNLV Tourism Business Igniter. The program with federal dollars helps local businesses develop a business, marketing and social media plan to attract tourists.\n\n“Cultural tourism is particularly relevant here in the Westside,” said Assistant Professor Marta Soligo, Director of Tourism Research for UNLV. When I asked our interviewees how would they like to see cultural tourism in the Historic Westside, we have so many answers. Some of them say music. They will love to see jazz clubs, and other say food,” Soligo said.\n\nSmall businesses like Soul Foo Young already see tourists from across the country. Owner Artisha Hall tells FOX5, she would love for tourists to spend a whole day in the Historic Westside, just like tourists do now in Chinatown and the Arts District.\n\nYou want to come and feel what was so great about the Westside and the nostalgia of it. If you do that, I think that you get more people over here. You tell them about the past, they’re intrigued to come see-- find out --and then they find me,” Hall said.\n\nThe city of Las Vegas has a vision for the Historic Westside with their “Hundred Plan”: it includes revival of Jackson Street, once home to numerous minority-owned businesses, and now owned by property owners looking for opportunities. There is a plan for an entertainment district around the site of the historic Moulin Rouge, the site of the resort and casino that welcomed all visitors during the era of segregation.\n\nFor more information on the UNLV Tourism Business Igniter, click here: Nevada Partners\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

(FOX5) - It is a question asked by many people in Southern Nevada.\n\nWhy did planners choose a city about 45 miles outside Downtown Los Angeles to connect to Las Vegas via high-speed rail?\n\nWork is now underway on Brightline West. The line broke ground last month, south of the Strip on Las Vegas Blvd. It will connect to Rancho Cucamonga, California.\n\nRancho Cucamonga is a straight shot down the I-15 on the other side of the Cajon Pass, one of only a few ways to get past a large mountain range and to the biggest cities in Southern California from Vegas. Freight trains currently use the route to transport goods out of Southern California and for drivers, it is the most direct route.\n\nOnce at the Rancho Cucamonga Metrolink station, existing railways can take you just about anywhere you want to go throughout Southern California. From Rancho, you can get deeper into San Bernardino County, Riverside County, Orange County, Los Angeles County, and even up the coast to Ventura.\n\n“It’s great because right now my wife is plugging in to go to Union Station from here and then we will go Metrolink up to Santa Barbara. There are so many different places you can go,” Rancho Cucamonga resident Steve Geist shared with FOX5′s Kim Passoth while she was visiting the station. The Geist’s trip for two to DTLA: $12.\n\n“You can avoid sitting in traffic. This train will be operating at close to 80 miles per hour. The vehicles there in the primary lanes are basically operating at a standstill,” stated Metrolink spokesperson Scott Johnson, looking out at traffic on I-10 from a train window. Johnson takes the train daily through Rancho, commuting from his home in San Bernardino to his office in Downtown Los Angeles, a trip that could take three hours during rush hour.\n\nMetrolink map(FOX5)\n\n“This express train that I am on will get me home in less than an hour,” Johnson revealed.\n\nOnce the Brightline West line is complete, the goal is to make Southern California accessible to Nevadans without the need for a car.\n\n“People who live in Las Vegas who want to explore Southern California, whether it be Los Angeles, any one of the destinations like Universal Studios, anything Downtown around the convention center, the beaches or Disneyland and other tourist destinations. There isn’t a single destination in Southern California, certainly not in Los Angeles, that you can’t reach either by Metrolink or using the Metro light rail,” Johnson contended.\n\nThe best part? A Brightline ticket will get you anywhere you want to go on Metrolink’s network.\n\n“The long-range goal of the service is that a single Brightline ticket will allow you to be able to transfer to and from Metrolink at no additional cost,” Johnson revealed. Johnson also told FOX5 that luggage would be transferred for you as well, like a layover at an airport.\n\nThe goal is to have Brightline West running by the summer of 2028 in time for the Olympics just down in Los Angeles. Metrolink is also investing billions ahead of 2028 with more than 20 improvement projects planned.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU. All rights reserved.",

(FOX5) - Many parents on social media expressed outrage over an amateur event featuring characters from “Bluey” with crowds of disappointed families, while the restaurant offered an apology and told FOX5 that they did not expect the massive turnout with high expectations.\n\nThe Dirt Dog restaurant event that was posted on Facebook had a response of 3,000 people. It advertised an event with Bluey and other characters from the popular show, and free offerings like face painting and desserts.\n\nPhotos from parents show lines out the door and people posted on social media concerns about capacity and crowd control. When inside the crowded restaurant, people encountered amateur costumes, homemade treats and face painting from a restaurant staff member.\n\n“I was mad. He looked unexpected,” said Sophia, a child who attended the event. “We could see his beard,” she said about the less-than-ideal Bluey impersonator.\n\n“The kids were distraught. Some kids were crying. Some kids were upset, crying in their parents’ shoulders,” mother Stephanie Hernandez said. “How could you do that to little kids: advertise something so fun and eventful for kids ranging from toddlers to six, seven years old, and not actually follow through with it? It was a very upsetting moment to see so many kids, especially my daughter, just really upset,” she said.\n\nDirt Dog management sat down with FOX5 to explain the well-meaning intentions behind the event. Staff like to plan events for their “regulars,” and they volunteered to be the costume characters, worked as staff for face painting and even baked goods for the event. One restaurant worker personally baked 125 cupcakes, but they were gobbled up shortly after the event started.\n\n“We expected like maybe 50 to 60 people--not in the sense of like the whole city coming out. Just now knowing who Bluey is, we would have planned ahead and would have had security,” said Taj Wilder, a spokesperson for marketing for the restaurant. She said while the event had 3,000 responses on Facebook, many other posts garner similar interest but crowds never turn out.\n\nWilder apologized to disappointed customers and promises more for customers and families.\n\n“We’re very much family. We love on each other, we support each other. We’re going to continue to make events, create events, especially free ones, for families to come out and have a good time with us,” she said.\n\nThe restaurant posted an apology on social media and promises to make it up to the community. Wilder tells FOX5, the restaurant’s marketing team from Los Angeles will come and plan a family-friendly event, and they are working to secure the real Bluey for an appearance.\n\nParents had mixed reviews and responses online to the event and the apology.\n\n“Thanks for ruining my 3 year olds day!” one parent said.\n\n“I drove one hour just to see a grown man in PJs,” another wrote.\n\nSome defended the restaurant. “A free event. It is a risk you take,” one parent said.\n\nOther parents were pleased with the event. “My son loved this event! Thank you for hosting!” another said online.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

The bill’s sponsor tells FOX5 this should be a sign that more laws around balloon releases are needed.\n\nThousands of people in the Las Vegas Valley were left without power after an NV Energy outage on Thursday night.\n\n“I think last weekend, what happened was a great sort of wake up,” Councilor Nancy Brune said. “You may think you’re having fun celebrating a graduation or a gender reveal, you release these balloons, and the next thing you know, you’re without power.”\n\nBrune says even before the council votes on it, people should still be aware of what they’re releasing. She said the council is launching a public information campaign letting people know about what might happen if these kinds of balloons are released.\n\n“Graduation season is upon us, and we know that is actually one of the most popular times that our residents use to release balloons,” she said.\n\nBrune told FOX5 there have been about 400 outages caused by mylar balloons in the last four years in Las Vegas. Her bill was voted down by a recommending committee, but is still going before City Council on June 5 for a full vote.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU. All rights reserved.",

(FOX5) - After accusations back and forth about bargaining, Virgin Hotels Las Vegas is expected to meet with union negotiators Tuesday morning.\n\nA contract ended about a year ago and 700 union members wrapped up a two-day strike over the weekend outside the casino hotel.\n\n“We’re not interested in listening to a lot of Wall Street gobbledygook. We’re interested in listening to a company that wants to treat their workers first class. And if that’s where we’re at then we’ll be there as long as it takes. But if not, we’ll see,” said Culinary Union Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge.\n\nNegotiations will continue on Tuesday as workers seek a new contract.\n\nThe union says Virgin Hotels is not offering any wage increases as part of a new deal. Virgin Hotels officials have not commented to FOX5 on the wage complaint by the union. It has complained the union is bargaining in bad faith.\n\nThe casino hotel says the union has engaged in unlawful “take it or leave it” negotiating tactics and said an Executive Board scheduled a strike after canceling a meeting for May 2. The Culinary Union says it proposed several bargaining sessions that Virgin Hotels said no to.\n\nThe union tells FOX5 negotiations Tuesday morning will happen at Virgin Hotels.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

        "content": "LAS VEGAS, Nev. (FOX5) - Clark County School District announced the closure of the only elementary school in Mt. Charleston on Monday.\n\nAccording to a parent letter obtained by FOX5, officials decided to close Earl B. Lundy Elementary School “due to the expense of rebuilding the school from the storms and flooding caused by Tropical Storm Hilary in August 2023.”\n\nThe elementary school caters to about a dozen students, with many able to walk to and from school. However, they have not been able to do that for months since tropical storm Hilary forced the school to close temporarily, and now it does not seem as though the doors will reopen.\n\n“I would basically wake up and get ready for 30 minutes and walk down to the school,” a student said.\n\nFor decades, families in the Mt. Charleston area had the comfort of having an elementary school right in their mountain neighborhood.\n\n“It is convenient but also a necessity for our small children to have a school so close,” Katie Reeh said.\n\nThat convenience was wiped away along with roads and trails when tropical storm Hilary slammed into the mountains which did not spare Lundy Elementary School.\n\n“It was an abrupt end to the school year,” Sarah Hickam, a parent said. For a whole school year, students at Lundy were placed in Indian Springs, with about an hour bus ride each way.\n\n“It has been tough, especially for my son. I don’t like him getting up at 5:30 in the morning just to get ready for school,” Anthony Armas said.\n\nMany who chose the mountain lifestyle are now left to rethink their plans.\n\n“There is a lot of little ones in this mountain and more families are coming up here they were depending on having a school, so it is very disappointing,” Jessie Thompson another parent said.\n\nFor months, since the storm hit, residents told FOX5 they were hopeful the closure was just temporary, but now that they know the school district’s plans to close, they hope they will reconsider.\n\nOfficials say the closure is aligned with school district regulations and will be reviewed by CCSD Trustees in June. Those attending Lundy Elementary will be reassigned to Indian Springs Elementary School.\n\n“The Mount Charleston community would maintain a cohesive, feeder school alignment with the opportunity for siblings to attend the same school as the current middle and high school students assigned to Indian Springs Middle School and High School,” administrators noted in the letter.\n\nThe complete text of the letter is as follows:\n\nDear Earl B. Lundy Elementary School Families:\n\nAfter much review and consideration, we have made the difficult decision to recommend the closure of Earl B. Lundy Elementary School due to the expense of rebuilding the school from the storms and flooding caused by Tropical Storm Hilary in August 2023. We recognize and understand the impact this decision will have on our students, families, staff, and community of Earl B. Lundy Elementary.\n\nThe process to recommend the closure of Earl B. Lundy Elementary School is aligned with Clark County School District Regulation 7113, including a recommendation to close the school to the Board of School Trustees at a Regular Board Meeting in June 2024. In addition, the Clark County School District’s Comprehensive Planning Department evaluated the potential attendance zone reassignment options regarding the recommended closure of Earl B. Lundy Elementary School and recommended reassigning the Earl B. Lundy Elementary School students of Mount Charleston to Indian Springs Elementary School. The Mount Charleston community would maintain a cohesive, feeder school alignment with the opportunity for siblings to attend the same school as the current middle and high school students assigned to Indian Springs Middle School and High School.\n\nPlease be assured that District staff will be readily available to assist and support you and your children during this transition. We are confident that by working together we will promote the success of our students. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact my office at 702-799-5310.\n\nDr. Brenda Larsen-Mitchell, CCSD Interim Superintendent\n\nThis is a developing story, please check back later for updates.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

(FOX5) - A historic salt tram tower in Saline Valley has been damaged according to the National Park Service.\n\nPark rangers believe the 113-year-old tower was pulled over while a person used a winch to get their vehicle out of deep mud. NPS seems to think it happened sometime between April 1 and April 24, 2024.\n\nThe tower toppled over, pulling its concrete footings out of the ground, officials said. As the investigation continued, rangers found tire marks nearby. They believe the vehicle drove a short distance off the legal roadway and then got stuck.\n\n”I have hiked along sections of this tramway, and am amazed by the tenacity it took to build,” said Superintendent Mike Reynolds. “I hope the person responsible for this damage will contact us so we can discuss restitution.”\n\nDeath Valley historic salt tram tower damaged(National Park Service)\n\nBack in the early 1900s, the Saline Valley Salt Company built the 13-mile aerial tram to transport salt from Saline Valley to Owens Valley.\n\nThe salt tram is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is considered nationally significant as it climbed over 7,000 vertical feet at steep grades up to 40 degrees. The age, length and preservation of the tower all reflect why NPS is seeking more information.\n\nOnly the first four towers are within Death Valley National Park. Most of the tramway crosses lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Tram tower #1 is the tower closest to the Saline Valley lakebed.\n\nA salt tram stabilization project was planned before this damage happened. It is unclear if the funding can also be used to re-anchor the fallen tower.\n\nPark rangers are asking anyone with information on this incident to contact the NPS-wide tip line at 888-653-0009 or submit a tip here.\n\nCopyright 2024 KVVU.

        "content": "BRADLEY, Maine (WABI) - Saturday was the annual Alewife Day hosted by Maine Forest and Logging Museum.\n\n“Every year, millions, literally millions of alewives come back up through here to spawn in Chemo Pond,” explains National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) fisheries biologist Max Tritt. “The problem is with the dams and the barriers that we put in their way, they can’t quite make it. So NOAA, our partners Corps of Engineers, several others designed and built this fishway to help get them back into Chemo Pond.”\n\nTritt estimates it has been about a decade since the fish ladder was constructed in the Blackman Stream that flows through the museum grounds.\n\nCatching a glimpse of the alewives’ journey to Chemo Pond, visitors were able to give them a hand by catching the fish with a net and releasing them into the fishway. With biologists like Tritt present, they were also able to learn about alewives and their annual migration.\n\nAlewives are anadromous, meaning they can live in both fresh and saltwater. Every year, waves of alewives make their way from the ocean up streams like Blackman to reproduce in Chemo Pond. When these eggs hatch, they will swim out into the ocean to begin their own migration journey.\n\nFor many, Saturday was their first time touching a live fish.\n\n8-year-old Stella described the alewife as “slimy”, but catching her first fish made her happy!\n\nIt was also Wyatt’s, 5, introduction to fishing. He said how to catch a fish was the most fun thing he learned during the all-day event.\n\nUp the hill from the stream you’ll find the smokehouse, where you can sample smoked alewives yourself... I know I had to!\n\nA day of many firsts, it was Erik Anderson’s first time visiting the museum and trying alewife: “Lots of bones, which is to be expected. But I mean the flavor’s gorgeous, has a beautiful caramelized brown color. It’s got a sweet taste to it.”\n\nGetting out of the mainstream, the museum held blacksmith, wool-spinning, and water-powered saw mill demonstrations across the property.\n\nOperation Game Thief were also on the grounds, serving up a barbeque lunch for visitors. The museum has partnered with the state anti-poaching nonprofit.\n\nWhy the big fuss for such a small fish? Because, like most anything in nature, alewives play an important role in our ecosystem!\n\n“Alewives are referred to as ‘the fish that feeds everything’, and it can go to sea and they can feed seals, they can feed Cormorants, they can feed people!” remarks Tritt. “So it’s an intricate web, and they’re an integral part of it.”\n\nAlewife Day can also be cause for a mindful moment, says Anderson: “Just seeing where things that you interact with daily come from, especially when it comes to animals and the food we eat. We’re often detached, just going to the grocery store, so it’s neat to see what you can do with the resources around you.”\n\nFor museum Board of Directors President Michael Wetherbee, alewives hold ties in Maine history and our environment.\n\n“We want to celebrate that fact that we need to keep this resource going. It’s important for the animals in the area, it’s important for some of the satellite industries, the lobster industry does use alewives for bait,” says Wetherbee. “You have to be responsible about your community, as in the whole ecological and environment community.”\n\nMaine Forest and Logging Museum is open 365 days a week and holds many events throughout the year. They are always looking for volunteers to help tend to their over 400-acre living history museum.\n\nFor more information, head over to their website.\n\nCopyright 2024 WABI. All rights reserved.",

More than 125 years and a few rebuilds later, the 500-foot spectacle is still providing food, entertainment and fun for visitors and locals alike.\n\n“It’s a good thing. It’s almost tradition and everybody gets excited about the season and we got a lot of new folks coming in and college kids and schoolteachers getting out of school. It’s a lot of fun for us,” said Rich Redmond, pier operator.\n\nMost of the pier’s businesses opened on Friday, so they’ll be prepared for Memorial Day Weekend.\n\nAAA predicts the holiday weekend could be the biggest since 2000 in terms of travelers headed somewhere more than 50 miles away.\n\n“We can handle major crowds, so it’s nothing new to us,” said Redmond.\n\nPier businesses aren’t the only ones that will see a spike in visitors over the holiday. Dozens of other businesses in OOB opened their doors Friday to prepare for the busy weekend ahead.\n\n“Summer is short, so let’s do it, do it right and have a good time and have a happy 2024,” Redmond said.\n\nCopyright 2024 WABI.

        "content": "LEWISTON, Maine (WABI) - May is Lyme Disease Awareness Month.\n\nMaine Tracking Network reported almost 3 thousand Mainers were diagnosed with Lyme disease in 2023.\n\nLyme Disease is spread through blacklegged tick bites. Per the CDC, undiagnosed Lyme disease can spread to and affect the joints, heart, and nervous system.\n\nAwarded installation artist Amy Stacey Curtis of Lewiston has had a long journey fighting the symptoms of what her doctors call untreated Lyme.\n\nHer battle began in March 2017 as suicidal ideation suddenly took over her thoughts.\n\n“I nicknamed the thing that was going on in my head ‘The Imposter’,” says Curtis on the way she felt her brain was being hijacked by these constant distressing thoughts.\n\nFrom there, her symptoms only worsened: “Six or seven months into the psychosis, I started to lose all the control of my muscles in my body, including the muscles in my face and also to lose the ability to talk.”\n\nAfter going through multiple doctors, medications, psychiatric hospitals, and even shock therapy, Curtis was recommended to see a naturopathic doctor.\n\n“He said, ‘I think that you have brain inflammation. It can be caused by different things, but it could be caused by Lyme Disease that was never treated. We can’t treat the Lyme Disease itself because it’s not in your system in that way. Lyme Disease attacked your brain and now you have to recover,’” recalls Curtis. “And he said, ‘I’m confident you can fully recover from this.’”\n\nBrain supplements, diet changes, and occupational therapy sessions helped Curtis slowly regain speech and movement.\n\nWith nonlinear and slow-moving progress, Curtis desperately wanted independence. She missed the daily tasks she often took for granted, most notably driving.\n\nThrough intuiting what would promote multitasking behaviors like operating a car, she decided to take matters into her own hands by learning how to play the ukulele.\n\n“It is really about the focus that’s involved with doing multiple things at the same time. So within a week, I had learned some basic chords and some songs, and within a week, my speech and my dystonia, and any other little tic, within a week, everything was gone,” comments Curtis.\n\nDespite the stellar progress, Curtis notes that her treatment is still not linear. Her speech and muscles still do get palsied in times of overstimulation.\n\nPatricia Mulholland is a Board-Certified Music Therapist, operating Be Your Note Music Therapy in her home. To her, how music has helped reconnect Curtis’ mind and body is apparent.\n\n“Now I did notice when I listened to Amy that her speech is still somewhat impaired. But when she sings, it’s absolutely clear and she has an absolutely beautiful voice,” explains Mulholland. “So that is one of the intentions of using singing as a way to bring language back. She was working on the fine motor, she was strumming and playing, she was looking at a score, and then of course, she was expressing herself vocally. And I would say that even listening to her, I would say there’s a lot of emotional connection there, so she’s really lighting up her limbic system, that’s the emotional center.”\n\nStarting with “Sunday Singalongs” on Facebook live, Curtis was convinced by her art students in November 2021 to take her talents to TikTok.\n\nNow, she has amassed almost 25 thousand followers and over 155 thousand likes.\n\n“I try to do a post every Tuesday of a new song, and then I’m trying to go live every Friday to do my hour of occupational therapy live,” Curtis explains of her current posting schedule.\n\nShe says TikTok has felt much more communal compared to other social media: “I’m getting a lot of comments from people who’ve had similar or connected experiences, folks who have people in their lives who have dementia, or stroke, or other types of brain injury, that it’s helpful as well and they share their stories about how music has helped.”\n\nMulholland echoes this sentiment, saying she has had patients referred by neurologists to her and uses music to keep them creative and their brain stimulated.\n\nThrough years of medical trial and error and concerted effort to regain control of her body and mind, the experience has shown Curtis the importance of self-advocacy.\n\n“Self-advocacy, intuiting what I need to do, using art and music in different ways to heal my brain,” remarks Curtis. “Watching the videos from where I’ve come from, it’s pretty amazing to see the difference.”\n\nCurrently, Curtis is involved in a music circle that occurs every second Tuesday in Lewiston. She also has prospects of professionally releasing music and her memoir, documenting her story in her own words.\n\nCopyright 2024 WABI. All rights reserved.",

I love helping people,” said Ian Facella of the Orono Police Department.\n\n“I felt a little bit of a call to the job. My dad was a state trooper. So, I kind of grew up around troopers and police officers and it just felt great. I want to serve my community,” said Jared Willette of the Bangor Police Department.\n\nThis class in particular included 23 military veterans.\n\n“It’s an opportunity for me to give back and serve and protect and take the skills that I’ve learned not only through this training but through my military experience and do my part in that way,” Willette added.\n\nIt’s a long road to get to this point as cadets take on 18 weeks of training.\n\n“In the beginning there’s a lot of yelling and screaming but you get used to it. But near the end, you learn a lot, a lot of different things. A lot of things will help you on the road. It seems like at the beginning 18 weeks is a long time. But once you get to the end, it goes by really quick,” said Facella.\n\nWhen it’s all said and done, they’re joined by their families onstage to commemorate the end of a journey and the start of a new one.\n\n“It’s elating I mean, just standing there and you know, my father that has put so many years in the State Police standing there and kind of almost like passing the torch down and having my wife being they’re the one that’s my rock and I was always there support me, sitting there with them. It was a very special moment,” said Willette.\n\nCopyright 2024 WABI. All rights reserved.",

        "content": "PITTSFIELD, Maine (WABI) - How would you react in a medical emergency?\n\nThat was the question for Maine Central Institute students Thursday in Pittsfield.\n\nAs part of their Introduction to Medical Concepts class, held in conjunction with Northern Light Sebasticook Valley Hospital, they performed in a mock disaster scenario.\n\nThe hospital’s Health and Wellness Education Coordinator Laurie Alexander sets the scene: “The scenario was that there was a track and field event going on, the stands were filled with students and parents and visitors. And this portion of the stands collapsed. And so, what happened, there was a bunch of people that were able to leave the scene, but the five that couldn’t were injured.”\n\nFive student volunteers acted as victims with various medical injuries to gauge how students would treat them. Makeup and prosthetic achieved the look of open wounds on the head and arms and even a broken leg. One volunteer had blue and white face paint under his eyes and on his fingertips to simulate low oxygen circulation. Another had no visible injuries at all, but was prompted to act as if he was internally bleeding.\n\nAfter the victims were prepped, it was time to send out the crews.\n\nThe students were quick to act, patching up wounds, stabilizing bone breaks, and even performing CPR and using a defibrillator.\n\n“I was just like, ‘Oh my God, what patient do I want to go to first? Which one needs the most help?’” MCI student Skyla Dean describes of the experience.\n\nStudent Grace Cunningham took the role of team leader, who says: “It was a little stressful. I had to go around to every patient and see what was happening, and then make sure whoever was over there had what was going on.”\n\nAlexander says this mock disaster is the culmination of 14 weeks worth of classes. The Introduction to Medical Concepts class teaches students medical skills like CPR and first aid, as well as job shadowing healthcare workers at Northern Light Sebasticook Valley Hospital.\n\nThe class’s teacher at MCI, Angie Palonis, hopes that these hands-on experiences will entice more students to pursue healthcare in the future: “What it is is a great way for students to be introduced to healthcare careers so that they get a better idea of what they might like to do, what they’d like to pursue. As we know in the state of Maine, we’re always needing more healthcare.”\n\n“It’s one thing to read about a career online or talk to somebody on the phone, but to actually see them doing their job and finding out why they liked the job. What are the limitations? What are the challenges, what’s exciting about that career? It really gives them an opportunity to see the whole picture,” remarks Alexander on the significance.\n\nDean says the emergency scenario has only reaffirmed her desire to pursue healthcare: ”I myself want to go into the ER and be a nurse, so this experience is kind of just a way for me to get an experience of what that’ll be like in a few years to come.”\n\nFor students who may be turned off from emergency aid, the job shadowing allows them to peer into many different departments that make up hospitals to find their perfect match.\n\nUltimately, students got the chance to test their instincts and learning in times it’s needed the most.\n\n“I think it’s very important, so if they do find themselves in these real world emergencies, they already have previous experience with it,” says one student actor Demarcus Smith.\n\nThis mock disaster was the first one in four years, due mostly to COVID. It was the third time MCI and Northern Light Sebasticook Valley Hospital conducted this exercise.\n\nCopyright 2024 WABI. All rights reserved.",

        "content": "BANGOR, Maine (WABI) - For the third year, adults living with various obstacles will take the stage in Bangor to bare their souls.\n\nOnce again, they’ll be joined by friends, both old and new, to share their message of inclusion and hope.\n\n“Unlimited Solutions Clubhouse is, we like to say, the best kept secret. We’d like to be the best-known solution, though,” said Carrie Lemos, executive director, Unlimited Solutions Clubhouse.\n\nLocated across from the Bangor Police station on Summer Street, Unlimited Solutions Clubhouse is a therapy through work program. The clubhouse helps adults living with various mental challenges find employment, decrease social isolation, further their education, and increase their overall wellness.\n\n“I really appreciate the clubhouse being here because without it I would really, really struggle,” said April Dowling, member, Unlimited Solutions Clubhouse.\n\nLike all nonprofits they could always use more friends - and more funding.\n\nBack in 2019 they started Melodies for the Mind, a benefit concert to help spread the word about the clubhouse and their services.\n\n“The clubhouse is all about music. If you’re here on a daily basis, we like to say it’s like an episode of ‘Glee,’ Lemos said. “Somebody might break out into song. And so, a benefit concert was kind of a natural place for us to go for a fundraiser.”\n\nAs part of the event, a group from the clubhouse takes the stage to sing “Suddenly,” a song written and composed by a fellow member.\n\n“I sing the song ‘Suddenly’ every night before I go to bed, which is the song we’ll be performing,” Dowling said. “The song is all about overcoming your obstacles and reaching new heights.”\n\nThursday’s lineup includes the annual appearance from Maine Street R&B Revue.\n\nAnd, in a first this year, Maine comedian and new clubhouse ally Tim Sample will be performing.\n\n“A room full of people, old people, young people, black people, white people, people of different cultural and economic and political backstories, in the same room at the same time laughing at the same thing is a magical transformative experience,” Sample said.\n\nSample says he jumped at the opportunity to participate in Melodies for the Mind.\n\nHe says he has his own personal connection to mental and emotional health issues stemming from a traumatic brain injury as a child that led to a learning disability.\n\n“It was completely undiagnosed and untreated, and created a lot of cognitive dissonance as I went along,” Sample explained.\n\nNow in his 70s, he’s not performing as much.\n\nBut he’s looking forward to returning to the Gracie stage with a goal similar to the clubhouse’s mission: bringing people together.\n\n“A place where you feel like you belong, and you don’t belong because you check off all the boxes. You belong because you’re you and that’s a powerful thing,” Sample said.\n\nMelodies for the Mind is scheduled for Thursday, May 16, at the Gracie Theater at Husson University starting at 6:00 p.m.\n\nTickets are available online at unlimitedsolutionsclubhouse.com or you can buy them at the door.\n\nCopyright 2024 WABI.

So when I do psychotherapy with people with PTSD, one of the first things we have to get over is it is uncomfortable to talk about. A film will give them a whole other way to get into that conversation and hopefully start some healing if that needs to occur,” psychologist Dr. David Prescott said.\n\nAll proceeds collected were given to the Maine Veteran’s Project.\n\nCopyright 2024 WABI.

I love meeting people and seeing what actual opportunities are around this area that I can actually like. It’s very effective.

We find that they’re very professional. They’re so eager to learn, and you can pick them right out of the group, you know, that you know who’s going to go the furthest, you know, in their education,” said Susan Cronkhite, a clinical supervisor at St. Josheph Hospital.\n\nThe school offers a range of different professions to learn about, and the fair was full of options.\n\n“I think these things are always great because it gives all students from different programs look into like, fields around the area, and I think that that’s very important because especially since we live in Maine, we want people to stay in Maine,” said Sam Wingard, a law enforcement student.\n\n“I talked to the Old Town police officers, and that’s like a department that like, I really think is interesting because like, I want to stay in the area. And, I do want a future in law enforcement once I like graduate college and stuff,” Wingard added.\n\nFor many, the future can be uncertain, but that’s where the fair comes in.\n\n“Yeah, it’s definitely settled a lot of nerves for me for sure. It’s going from knowing nothing, like how do I even get a job? You know, because school doesn’t really teach you that.

We have plans to extend it down the entire street and we have some additional surprise amenities coming. There’ll be like big umbrella, upside down umbrella shaped benches, and upside-down umbrella planters that line the street and just it will really activate the street and make it really exciting,” explained Betsy Lundy, Executive Director, Downtown Bangor Partnership.\n\n“I think it’s a positive thing to have here. People can just look at it and maybe it can cheer them up a bit. You know, times are tough, but just maybe it’ll cheer someone up. I noticed it the other day, ‘wow, that’s really cool.’ It kind of brightened my day a little bit,” said Bangor Resident Gladys Bridges.\n\nOn sunny days, when the light shines through the umbrellas it can create a sort of stained-glass effect on the street below.\n\nCopyright 2024 WABI.

        "content": "BRADLEY, Maine (WABI) - On Saturday, you can get a taste of Maine’s rich logging and forestry history all while witnessing the migration of hundreds of thousands of alewife fish.\n\nThis is part of Maine Forest and Logging Museum’s Alewife Day.\n\n“Every year we have a migration of the alewives, which is a river herring. They come up Blackman Stream, and they migrate their way up to Chemo Pond,” explains museum volunteer Bryan Harper.\n\nAccording to Harper, how many alewives pass along the stream is dependent on various factors including weather. He says due to colder weather last year, about 550,000 fish migrated through the stream. The year before, Harper estimates it was about 600,000 alewives.\n\nWith the warmer weather this week, Harper is hopeful of their outcome.\n\n“I’m hoping that for the fish, you will see a huge influx of them as the day warms up. Sunday, we had 12,500 that went up through the fish ladder, and Monday we had 15,000 by, I think it was, 10 a.m.,” he said.\n\nAlongside the alewife migration, the museum will be brimming with activity for all-age fun and learning. You can participate in the 5K fun run, visit the blacksmith shop or water-powered sawmill, or the smokehouse to sample some alewives yourself!\n\nDue to permits, the museum is able to catch about 250 fish to smoke. It is a three-day process of brining the fish and hanging them in the smokehouse to cook. Volunteers like Harper must tend to the fire inside the smokehouse every three hours to ensure efficiency.\n\nPerfectly placed to see the alewives pass through during their pilgrimage, the museum saw it as an opportunity for a lesson in Maine forestry history.\n\n“We have been here for over 60 years. We cover over 400 acres. It’s a living history museum, and logging is such an incredible history, especially in Maine,” comments Alissa Wetherbee, who is on the museum’s Board of Directors. “You usually find someone whose father, grandfather, great grandfather, grandmother, had logging in their family history.”\n\n“Part of the history with Maine and the forestry industry, especially out in the woods, would be trying to maintain your logging camps with fresh produce, fish, so smoking was a big part of that in this area because of the migration of the alewives,” explains Harper on alewives’ connection to the area. “It gave them that unique opportunity to have a supplement for their food source.”\n\nThe fun run is slated to start at 9 a.m., and the festivities will run until 3 p.m.\n\nIt costs $10 for adults and $5 for kids, but museum members get in for free.\n\nFor more information, visit Maine Forest and Logging Museum’s website.\n\nCopyright 2024 WABI.

One that’s unlike any other on the road.\n\nAs Anders Lovstuen is getting ready to finish up high school, he’s also learning to drive his newly outfitted truck.\n\nPeople from Maine to Texas helped make this vehicle possible.\n\n“There are solutions out there to a lot of problems that you didn’t even know existed,” said Anders.\n\nDecorah native Anders Lovstuen, 18, was born without arms or legs.\n\n“I’ve never really known anything different. So you know it’s not necessarily... Yeah, there are a few things I can’t do, but most things I can do, even if I do them a little bit differently than everybody else,” said Anders.\n\nAnd that includes driving.\n\nWhen Anders was 15, he reached out to his local Vocational Rehabilitation Services to see what the options were.\n\nDecorah’s VR got Anders in contact with Texas-based Driving Ambitions, a company that helps people with disabilities drive.\n\n“Did the initial evaluation, you know how or what sort of system is going to be necessary for me to drive?” said Anders.\n\nFrom there Anders trained on an outfitted van learning all the controls. But because Anders lives on a gravel road, they quickly learned he needed something a bit bigger.\n\nSo, they looked into a Maine-based company called Electronic Mobility Controls -- and they were able to outfit a truck with everything Anders needs to drive.\n\n“Little regular things like that really help sink in the magnitude of me being able to drive and, you know, go places and do things that I want to do,” said Anders.\n\nOnce the truck was outfitted, it was shipped back to Iowa for Anders to complete his training.\n\nHe uses a joystick with his shoulder to drive and a touch screen with his nose for things like putting the truck into gear.\n\nMichael Courtney, a driver evaluator for Driving Ambition said he’ll go through 40 hours of training.\n\n“It’s very comprehensive. We take them everywhere in between the parking lot to the freeway and of course, working on parking and everything else, getting them prepared to be able to control the vehicle,” said Courtney.\n\nAnders said once he passes his driver’s exam, he’ll drive himself to graduation parties and see his show cattle on his Grandpa and Uncle’s farm.\n\n“I can just go there by myself,” said Anders.\n\nAnd Anders said for those with disabilities, it’s never too late to give up on the chance of independence.\n\n“If you really look hard, there a lot of problems have already been solved that you might not think would have,” he said. “Yeah, there’s a lot of different cool stuff out there.”\n\nCopyright 2024 WABI.

        "content": "HAMPDEN, Maine (WABI) - The United States Postal Service says it will pause proposed changes at the Hampden Processing Facility until January 1st.\n\nThe Postal Service proposed converting the Hampden facility into a local processing center which would force outgoing mail to Scarborough.\n\nUSPS also says it will pause similar changes to other facilities across the nation.\n\nThe response from USPS follows a letter sent by a bipartisan group of senators including Maine’s Susan Collins, Rep. Golden, and Angus King.\n\nCollins said in a statement Tuesday, “This USPS pause is welcome news for the people of Maine. This pause, however, should not be temporary – it should be permanent. The USPS should abandon these proposed changes entirely until there can be a study that ensures mail delivery will not be harmed, and we will continue to press them to do so.”\n\nMeanwhile, Golden released the following statement following the announcement:\n\n“I’ve fought tooth and nail to protect rural communities from the restructuring proposed by USPS because I know how Mainers rely on the mail to receive medicine, conduct business, and keep in touch with their loved ones,” Golden said. “This announcement is a big win for the entire state, and I’ll continue to push for a permanent stop to any plans that threaten mail service.”\n\nUSPS’ moratorium follows Golden’s introduction of bipartisan legislation to freeze Mail Processing Facility Reviews (MPFRs) nationwide and his repeated outreach to DeJoy throughout the review of the Hampden facility to express concerns about the agency’s consolidation process.\n\n“We were very pleased to see that the Postal Service is pausing the current network changes until next year,” Scott Adams, President of the American Postal Workers Union of Maine, said. “That should give sufficient time to assess the current delayed mail issues and hopefully correct them, inclusive of returning the process to the way it was before DeJoy’s changes were implemented.  There are no details to the effect this will have on the Eastern Maine P&DC, but since most changes have yet to take place, we see this as great news that should benefit Mainers and their mail service.  Again, thanks to Congressman Golden’s efforts on this, as the decision clearly came about from the pressure from Congress and Postal patrons.”\n\nIn a letter today to Sen. Gary Peters, chairman of the Senate’s Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said he “need[s] more time to evaluate” the effects of MPFRs on timely mail service following outreach from lawmakers in both chambers and that he “will not advance these efforts without advising you of our plans to do so, and then only at a moderated pace of implementation.”\n\nMail Processing Facility Reviews were launched in 2021 to study the feasibility of relocating certain postal operations from local facilities to larger regional ones. The USPS first announced that it was reviewing consolidation of some mail processing from the Eastern Maine facility into its Scarborough site last November, and its decision to move forward with the plan follows a February public hearing that garnered widespread opposition from Mainers across the state.\n\nLast month, Golden introduced bipartisan legislation to eliminate funding for the Mail Processing Facility Review process, effectively blocking the USPS’ plans to shift mail processing from Hampden to Scarborough. The Timely Mail Delivery and Postal Services Protection Act would also require any future consideration of consolidation to be reviewed by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent and bipartisan oversight panel composed of members appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nPrior to his legislation, Golden demanded answers about what steps the agency was taking to prevent mail delays and job losses in the Second District.\n\nFull text of the legislation can be found here.\n\nCopyright 2024 WABI.

Janet Mills said Tuesday she won’t sign any of the 35 bills sent to her on the final day of the session, allowing all of them to die.\n\nMills, who believed Democratic leaders were disregarding her request to be fiscally responsible, was at odds with those who sought to vote on 80 additional bills requiring spending on a final day, which is normally reserved for vetoes. She said it was wrong to try to adopt so many additional bills after the statutory adjournment date had passed.\n\nMills’ position caused tension when the Senate attempted to deliver 35 enacted bills to her office on Friday. Her office initially declined to accept them, creating a standoff between the executive and legislative branches. The House did not try to adopt additional bills, heeding the governor’s wishes. Ultimately, lawmakers adjourned without further action.\n\nIn a written statement, the governor said she was rejecting “harmful precedent” by declining to act on the bills, and she chastised legislative leaders for disregarding constitutional norms that provide “important institutional safeguards.”\n\n“While well intentioned, the Legislature’s decision to consider and enact dozens of additional spending measures on veto day without clear constitutional authority erodes longstanding norms and would create a destabilizing precedent that may be used by future legislatures to achieve aims not so desirable,” she wrote.\n\nState law required the legislative session to end April 17 but lawmakers were allowed to return to deal with vetoes. A spokesperson for the governor said there’s precedent for lawmakers to take up a few other bills on the so-called “veto day” but only with the consent of both parties. Enacting all of the proposed bills would’ve invited lawsuits, the spokesperson said.\n\nCopyright 2024 WABI. All rights reserved.",

Maybe another third kind of slow down to a rolling stop, and then maybe the other third actually make a complete stop,” said Hill, who lives near the intersection.\n\n“She has a legitimate complaint. She lives in a rural area. It’s a four-way intersection there, four-way stop. Every vehicle approaching the intersection is supposed to come to a complete stop before they proceed through the intersection and a lot of vehicles don’t, and, you know, I understand we’ve had several complaints from people living in that area that people will roll right through that stop sign. Some of them won’t even slow down,” explained Mike Mitchell, Chief Deputy, Somerset County Sheriff’s Office.\n\n“I think law enforcement is overwhelmed with a lot of other problems, and they simply don’t have the people and the time and the resources to devote what is necessary to the corner,” added Hill.\n\nSomerset County’s Deputy Chief says deputies do enforce the laws when they are present.\n\n“All the deputies for the Somerset County Sheriff’s Office that patrol that particular area are aware of the complaint and during their discretionary time when they’re out on patrol, they should be passing through that area and taking enforcement action as deemed necessary, if they see motorists failing to stop at one of those intersections,” Mitchell stated.\n\nHill continues to try and have her voice heard.\n\n“I have contacted the town select board, I’ve contacted the town office, I’ve contacted the state and state police, sheriff, you know, and a lot of times they’ll say, ‘well, if people are going through the stop sign, it’s a law enforcement issue,’ and we have made all kinds of phone calls,” said Hill\n\n“This is a town-maintained roadway as opposed to a state highway. The town could, there’s some implements that they could put, like speed bumps in that area if they wanted to, flashing yellow signs, caution stop sign ahead, you know, to give somebody a warning, maybe another sign prior to approaching that intersection, it warns you that a stop sign is ahead.

        "content": "GARDINER, Maine (WABI) - The Maine Board of Funeral Services met Tuesday to address complaints against Harold “Chip” Lamson.\n\nLamson Funeral Home locations have been under investigation, and two, one in Lincoln and the other in Millinocket, were recently searched as part of a theft investigation\n\nComplaints against Lamson pertain to issues with mortuary trusts, deficiencies with funeral services, and failing to communicate with families, among other things.\n\nNine complaints were brought against Lamson that included more than 60 violations.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Lamson, along with his attorney and the Assistant Attorney General representing the Board Staff, presented a Consent Agreement to the board.\n\n“As part of a consent agreement, Mr. Lamson admits to all of the factual allegations that have been made in the notice of hearing. He acknowledges the truthfulness of each of those factual statements. We have nine different matters. Like I said, he does not dispute any of the facts in any of the complaints against him,” said Assistant Attorney General John Belisle\n\nLamson agreed to surrender his license in no more than 120 days.\n\n“The reason that we’ve agreed to 120 days is to give him time to essentially run his business, provide continuity to the community, and wrap up any ongoing client obligations he has, as of today. It would give him an opportunity to sell, lease, transfer, or close businesses or to hire another licensed, responsible person that can come in and run his operation for him,” said Belisle.\n\nIf Lamson settles these items and finds a new licensee to take over, he has to notify the board and likely surrender his license sooner.\n\n“As part of this probationary period of 120 days, Mr. Lamson has agreed to fully cooperate with any mortuary trust audits that he has for any mortuary trust accounts that he currently manages. With that, the audit will be carried out by staff and we’re complying officer and Mr. Lamson has agreed to provide full cooperation and access and copies of any records that he himself has custody and control of.\n\nLamson’s license will be revoked for five years.\n\nHe could reapply in three years, but would need board approval to be reinstated.\n\n“As additional oversight and terms of probation. Mr. Lamson has agreed to submit weekly written reports to board staff. Next, Mr. Lamson is agreeing to return all client property and funds and to respond to requests for records and he is committing to make reasonable efforts to resolve any of the outstanding issues and the nine complaints at issue this morning,” said Belisle.\n\nThe board discussed points of concerns of the agreement with Lamson and his attorney.\n\n“I just hope that the severity of what has happened over the last several years is acknowledged and the acknowledgement that there are very, as I said earlier, very scared families right now not knowing what’s going to happen if they have a death. I just really hope that’s acknowledged by Mr. Lamson and that he sees that this behavior whether it’s from him or from any other license,” said Belisle.\n\nAfter further discussion and review, the board voted to accept the Consent Agreement.\n\n“It is a unanimous four,” said a board member.\n\nCopyright 2024 WABI.

        "content": "AUGUSTA, Maine (WABI) - National Police Week falls on May 15 this year, a yearly remembrance event to commemorate all law enforcement lives lost in the line of duty.\n\nThe 32nd annual Maine Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Observance was held in Augusta Tuesday morning.\n\nEighty-eight names on the Maine Law Enforcement Memorial eternalize the state troopers, officers, game wardens, and more who made the greatest sacrifice while serving and protecting their communities.\n\nThe monument was erected in 1991 by the Maine Chiefs of Police Association following the death of Lewiston Police Officer David Payne.\n\nSpeakers observed all 88 officers on the memorial and acknowledged the sacrifices families and loved ones of law enforcement make every day, never knowing what their officer’s work day will bring.\n\n“In my 29 years of law enforcement, I can confirm there is no greater burden and no greater honor than to bear the loss of a friend, a colleague, or a loved one in service to our communities,” said Auburn Police Chief Jason Moen during his remarks.\n\nHe told us the importance of never forgetting the single name of a fallen Maine officer, “They gave the ultimate sacrifice in service of the state, and when you lay down your life for someone else, that is the greatest sacrifice you can make, and it’s very important for us to make sure that we honor that every year.”\n\nGov. Janet Mills was the keynote speaker, who honored the service and sacrifice officers make every day in our communities.\n\n“We grieve the loss of friends, family, and neighbors taken from us through this violence. May we also pause in solemn gratitude that we need not add another name for this memorial today,” said Mills during her address. “As district attorney, as a private attorney, as your attorney general, and now as your governor, please know that I see the unexpected risks that each of you take when you report to duty every day. I see the sacrifice of your loved ones, waiting to know if you will come home safely. And I see the spirit of our fallen officers embodied in your commitment to serve our community and to keep this state the safest place in the nation to live, work, and raise a family.”\n\nDespite all the differences fallen officers hold in their stories, Mills united them under one principle: “A principle that governed how they upheld the law, a promise to practice integrity, fairness, respect, and compassion in the 1000 daily acts they performed on behalf of the Maine people. As they patrolled our roads, guarded our cities and towns, our woods, lakes, bays, and skies, always ready for that one urgent call that may mean the difference between life and death.”\n\nFor Department of Public Safety Commissioner Michael Sauschuck, the importance of the memorial service lies in continuing their legacy in law enforcement and recognizing loved ones: “It gives us an opportunity to honor their lives, their careers, as well as their families for all that they’ve given to all of us.”\n\nWhite carnations were given to loved ones to honor the memory of their fallen officer and to acknowledge the sacrifices they make every day.\n\nThe family of State Trooper Charles Black, who died in service 60 years ago, make it a point to attend the memorial every year.\n\n“It was three weeks before I was born,” said Trooper Black’s son Charlie Black II. “That was kind of a defining moment and defining date for our family. It was never the same after that. You never know when routine can go to tragedy in an instant.”\n\nFour years ago, the Black family began the nonprofit organization Trooper Black Foundation. Their mission is to provide resources and support to first responders and their families during times of crisis or need.\n\nCopyright 2024 WABI. All rights reserved.",

        "content": "ORONO, Maine (AP) — As waves grew and gusts increased, a wind turbine bobbed gently, its blades spinning with a gentle woosh. The tempest reached a crescendo with little drama other than splashing water.\n\nThe uneventful outcome is exactly what engineers aimed for.\n\nThe demonstration featuring a 13-foot-tall (4-meter-tall) floating wind turbine in an indoor pool aimed to ensure it can withstand the strain of powerful water and wind when much larger versions are deployed in the ocean.\n\nIt’s the University of Maine’s contribution to a worldwide race to improve floating machines to tap wind that blows across deeper waters offshore, too deep to attach turbines to the seabed with permanent pilings.\n\nIn the next decade, UMaine researchers said, they envision turbine platforms floating in the ocean beyond the horizon, stretching more than 700 feet (210 meters) skyward and anchored with mooring lines.\n\n“These structures are massive,” said Anthony Viselli, chief engineer for offshore wind technology at the university’s Advanced Composites Center, after the demonstration wrapped up. “These would be some of the largest moving structures that humankind has endeavored to create. And there would be many of them.”\n\nAs the technology advances, dozens of designs are being promoted by experts who see floating wind turbines as a way to address climate change by shifting away from burning fossil fuels.\n\nFloating turbines are the only way some countries and U.S. states can capture offshore wind energy on a large scale. In the U.S. alone, 2.8 terawatts of wind energy potential blows over ocean waters too deep for traditional turbines that affix to the ocean floor, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. That's enough to power 350 million homes — more than double the number of existing homes in the U.S.\n\nThe first floating wind farm started operating off Scotland's coast in 2017. In the United States, the Department of Interior two weeks ago proposed the first floating wind energy auctions for the Gulf of Maine, following lease auctions for the West Coast that began in 2022. The nearly 1 million acres up for auction off the New England coast could generate enough clean wind energy to power more than 5 million local homes, the department said.\n\nUMaine is home to the nation's largest team of engineers dedicated to floating offshore wind. Other big players include Equinor, which has installed a demonstration floating project of the coast of Norway; global company Principle Power, which has installed small-scale projects off Scotland and Portugal; and SBM Offshore, which has a demonstration project off France.\n\nFloating offshore wind is still a nascent industry, however, making it expensive.\n\nThe Norwegian company Equinor postponed its Trollvind floating initiative, citing technology availability, rising costs and a strained timetable to deliver on the original concept.\n\nDanish wind energy developer Ørsted decided to focus its efforts on fixed-bottom turbines, foregoing deeper offshore regions including Japan, Norway, Spain, Portugal and the U.S. West Coast. \"We care a lot about affordability of renewable power, and floating wind is a lot more expensive than bottom-fixed,\" said CEO Mads Nipper.\n\nBut others are moving forward.\n\nGazelle Wind Power is developing a modular platform system to make manufacture and assembly cost-effective and efficient.\n\n“This is a global problem and this is an ideal solution in order to deliver power to shore,” said Gazelle Wind Power CEO Jon Salazar.\n\nUMaine launched its first floating prototype a decade ago and became a surprise global leader after a study showed that the Gulf of Maine had the wind energy potential of 156 nuclear power plants, due to fast, consistent wind.\n\nThe state could meet all its home heating needs and power every car — if they were all electric vehicles — by tapping just 3% of that water. That improves the odds of successfully sharing the resource with fishermen, recreational boaters, the military and, of course, marine life. Indeed, the federal government's lease proposal spares Maine's key lobstering grounds from development, removing a potential obstacle.\n\nTrailblazers in offshore wind are benefiting from work done by the oil industry, which engineered floating oil and gas rigs, said Habib Dagher, director of the Advanced Composites Center.\n\nThe university's wind wave basin, which looks something like a swimming pool with wave and wind generators that can mimic ocean conditions up to a 500-year storm, takes that work to the next level.\n\nOn a recent day, the semi-submersible floating turbine was tethered to the bottom of the basin. Its 1:70 scale represented a real turbine standing about 800 feet (240 meters) tall atop a platform in the ocean. The goal is to have industrial scale turbines of 15 to 20 megawatts each, Dagher said.\n\nSize and efficiency are keys to profitability. Larger wind turbines mean fewer are needed, reducing construction, installation and maintenance costs, Viselli said. With greater size and efficiency, developers envision only about 50 turbines needed to produce about the same amount of electricity as a nuclear power plant.\n\nFull-size turbines generate peak power starting at about 20 mph (32 kph). In powerful storms, they shut down automatically to avoid stressing the equipment or breaking. The mooring lines tethered to the ocean floor are made of rope nearly thick as a telephone pole and under heavy tension. That makes them safer for marine mammals.\n\nFor all the turbine technology, the platforms developed by UMaine can be built locally with concrete, a simple material that's readily available. The university already has partners around the world interested in licensing its technology. The state of Maine plans to develop a port facility in the Searsport area to build the floating bases and attach turbines before sending them into the Gulf of Maine.\n\nA brand new industry means some experiments in design will succeed and some will fail. And there is work to ensure that wind farms are good neighbors, overcoming objections from others using the ocean.\n\n“We’re going to have some problems and we have to figure out how to roll up our sleeves and solve these problems,” Dagher said. “And I think we have no choice as a society but to do that.”\n\n___\n\nMcDermott reported from Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

        "content": "BAR HARBOR, Maine (WABI) - “It is an enormous amount of money that goes to our infrastructure, and the amount of visitations that we have is very stressed. And it’s going to be a ripple effect,” said Susan Stanley, Seagrass Gallery owner.\n\nAs Memorial Day approaches, coastal towns in Maine are gearing up for the tourism season.\n\nBut, businesses in one popular stop are fighting to let more visitors get there.\n\nThe Association to Preserve and Protect Local Livelihoods is a local non-profit that has filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against an ordinance that limits cruise ships in Bar Harbor to allow no more than 1000 passengers to come ashore each day.\n\n“We formed a group of the citizens, taxpayers, and residents formed a group, a nonprofit to take the town’s orders to court and this latest filing is part of that process where we’re seeking injunctive relief to prevent the economic disruption,” Ocean Properties Director of Operations, Eben Salvatore.\n\nThe injunction would prevent the town from enforcing the ordinance until a court issues a final ruling on its legality.\n\n“More than 90% of our visitors annually come on ships larger than that. And as you can imagine, if you’re a cruise ship, to have to pick and choose who you would like to come ashore and who would have to stay on board, it’s not something that you will do, so they’re just not coming. It’s harmful to the taxpayers, it’s harmful to the businesses and the owners and their employees and families, etc.,” said Salvatore.\n\n“Bar Harbor has always been a tourism town, and people have arrived here on ships since the very beginning. So, this isn’t new in any regard. It’s not just the cruise ships. It’s the fact that they bring people back,” said Stanley.\n\nLocal businesses say return customers are a strong part of their income.\n\nAnd, it’s not only the money being spent at these establishments.\n\n“We do receive well over a million dollars in cruise ship fees, and that money is able to go to our town parks, our bathrooms, our sidewalks, our streetlamps,” said Stanley.\n\nLike many other coastal towns recovering from storm devastation, businesses on Mount Desert Island are seeing the financial hardships from those storms.\n\n“The only way to make up for the missing revenue is going to be raising our property taxes again. It’s got to be figured out somehow, and I think APPLL is more than willing to work with, you know, the other side about this, and I just hope that happens before it’s too late,” said Stanley.\n\nCopyright 2024 WABI.

It really has a lot of history and a lot of heart and the more I thought about it, we had to shoot it here.”\n\n“Anyone that’s familiar with the area is going to recognize places like The Levant Corner Store and Parth and his team over there, The Butcher The Baker and Brittany has been amazing, the city of Bangor we shot,” Rush said.\n\nSome of the crew working on the film have tons of experience, others are just getting their start.\n\n“It was really important for me to hire a crew locally. There’s a lot of talent in Bangor. There’s a lot of talent in Maine and in New England. My first AD, my assistant director, my producer Paul Farnham is from here we met in Los Angeles, but he’s here now, and he just did an absolutely amazing job putting this team together and to see so many people take pride in it reminds me of what it feels like to be from Maine and to work hard,” Rush said.\n\nEthan Thibault is student at United Technologies Center that got to work on set.\n\nThibault said “Having an experience like this has definitely been pretty mind changing. I definitely am a lot more hopeful about my future. I didn’t even know this was possible for someone in my shoes and where I am.”\n\nFor these students opportunities like this can be once in a lifetime.\n\n“I would love to get into film as soon as possible.

        "content": "AUGUSTA, Maine (WMTW) - Oxford County Sheriff Christopher Wainwright will keep his job.\n\nGov. Janet Mills issued her decision Monday afternoon.\n\nA hearing to discuss the complaints brought by the Oxford County Commission against Wainwright wrapped up on April 24.\n\nDuring the hearings, the prosecution claimed the sheriff violated state law and county policy when he traded firearms. In a rebuttal, the sheriff’s attorney argued that the trade-in allowance is used to offset the costs of modernizing department weapons, and that the process was authorized by the board.\n\nAnother complaint the prosecutor presented was one in which the sheriff was heard on a phone call telling a deputy, “I don’t have a boss,” and “I can shred any ticket I want.”\n\nIn another incident, the sheriff reportedly spoke to a deputy about a traffic ticket he had issued to a woman, telling the deputy to “make it right.”\n\nIn their complaint to the governor, the board listed incidents that they believe show Wainwright is unworthy of the office.\n\nThis includes an allegation that Wainwright illegally traded firearms from the Department’s evidence room.\n\nIncluded in their complaint to the governor, the County retained a lawyer to conduct an investigation into the Oxford County Sheriff’s Department. Maine’s Total Coverage obtained the full complaint and investigation documents today.\n\nThis investigation found that Sheriff Wainwright violated state law and county policy when he traded firearms with a gun shop.\n\nThe hearing was held before retired Maine Supreme Court Justice Donald Alexander. After that hearing, he issued an advisory decision with his recommendation to the governor, and in that advisory, he also recommended against removing Wainwright from office.\n\nIn her ruling Monday, Mills said “My decision here should not be viewed as a vindication of Sheriff Wainwright. The hearing record shows that he has made mistakes and acted intemperately on occasion. However, my role here is a narrow one: to consider the facts of the complaint, as established during the proceedings, and to conclude whether those facts justify the removal of a popularly elected official, as laid out by the Maine Constitution. I believe the evidence presented falls short of satisfying what must be a high standard for the Governor’s removal from office of a popularly elected Sheriff. In my view, the voters of Oxford County should be the ultimate judge of the Sheriff on these matters when and if he puts his name before them for reelection in the future.\n\nUnder the Maine Constitution, only the governor can remove a sheriff from office.\n\nCopyright 2024 WABI.

        "content": "The South Florida Spring Jamboree at Jupiter High School on Saturday morning was a thrilling event. In the final game, the home team hosted the formidable Miami Palmetto, setting the stage for an exciting match-up.\n\nNow, jamborees allow college scouts to come out and watch teams while the teams and coaches see how they stack up.\n\nDuring the first possession, Palmetto established physicality, and the run looked at the back, just running through every line of defense.\n\nNext, play the same thing: the do-it-all back hits the hole and gets Palmetto into scoring position, and hey, if it isn't broke, don't fix it. Palmetto gets on the board first and makes things 7-0.\n\nIn the end, Palmetto just had too much. The wideout gets free on a breakdown and hits his head on the goal post, and Palmetto takes this one 14-7.\n\n\"We're young on both sides of the ball, so we just need to clean up some tackling on the defense,\" Jupiter HS Football Coach Jason Kradman said. \"Kind of what your standard spring would be and then offensively just some execution on some of our RPOs and things like that.\"\n\nDown the road, Palm Beach Gardens hosted last year's state runner-up, Homestead, and the runner-ups showed what makes them one of the best in the state. In the first half, the backdrops back and finds the wideout on a slant, and he finds the endzone.\n\nMoments later, Homesteads back gets shifty and gets the boys back on the scoreboard.\n\nHomestead won this one 16-0, and after the game, Gardens shared their thoughts on improving.\n\n\"Just get together and get our timing down as a group with a freshman quarterback and just start working together,\" receiver Cole Cross said.\n\n\"We are an extremely young team, probably the youngest team I've ever been a part of but also one of the most talented teams I've been a part of,\" head coach Tyrone Higgins said. \"It's going to be fun growing these guys.\"\n\nScripps Only Content 2024",

The Vero Beach City Council approved the first draft at a Tuesday meeting.\n\n\"This is really about how we take downtown to the next level,\" Jason Jeffries, Vero Beach planning and development director, said. \"How do we incentivize new development and new residential development while keeping what is working for downtown?\"\n\nPlanning & Development Director Jason Jeffries discusses what the revitalization plan would entail.\n\nThe plan could include increasing walkability, adding parking and building affordable housing. But perhaps the most notable change would be the increase in density from 17 units per acre to as much as 60 units per acre. It's an issue that could be brought to voters in November.\n\n\"The city council does not have the authority to increase the density levels in any zoning district in the city,\" Jeffries said. \"That would actually have to be a referendum by the voters.\"\n\nMany Vero Beach residents feel the changes would be a positive.\n\nPhil Sunkel outlines why affordable workforce housing is essential for Vero Beach.\n\n\"When it comes to your restaurants, shops and things like that, meeting a higher density, especially 30, maybe even 60 units per acre, for workforce housing, is essential to keeping employees at these restaurants and stores,\" Phil Sunkel, a longtime Vero Beach resident said. \"Otherwise they're living in places like Sebastian and Port St. Lucie and spending their money there.\"\n\n\"The town is right for it,\" Mostoller said. \"It needs it.

Maurice may have been deprived of a nap on Friday, but his team has five days to prepare for Game 1 against the Rangers on Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden.\n\n\"I'm not doing that. I'm not doing anything with that,\" he said. \"I need a day off.\"\n\nAnton Lundell scored for the Panthers and also set up the game-winner when his shot was deflected to the left side of the net. Forsling came in and beat Jeremy Swayman on the short side.\n\n\"I didn't see it go in. I just saw someone else react. It was amazing,\" said Forsling, who scored 10 goals this season — one of them a game-winner. \"I'm not usually the guy who scores the game-winning goal; I'm out there trying to defend. It’s nice to help your team win, but I’ll stick to defense.\"\n\nFlorida won all three games in Boston this series and six straight playoff games at the TD Garden. The Panthers also knocked the record-setting Bruins out of the playoffs last year on their way to the Stanley Cup Final, where they lost to the Las Vegas Golden Knights.\n\n\"They had had such a big year last year,\" Maurice said. \"This series felt way different than last year's. I think we're a much better team than we were last year when we came in here.\"\n\nSwayman stopped 26 shots for the Bruins. Pavel Zacha scored to give Boston a 1-0 lead late in the first period, but they were unable to beat Bobrovsky again. In the series, the Panthers outshot the Bruins 198-135.\n\n\"You can’t win every game 2-1,\" Bruins coach Jim Montgomery said. \"Their goalie was good, and we didn’t beat him.\"\n\nThe Bruins got captain Brad Marchand back after he missed two games with an injury believed to be a concussion. The longest-tenured member of the roster got a big ovation at introductions; Montgomery said it helped propel Boston to a better start than previous games, where it spotted the Panthers to a lopsided shooting advantage early\n\n\"That ovation at the beginning of the game says it all,\" he said. \"I thought it was going to be our night before the game. I thought our players were loose and confident. They went out and played that way.\"\n\nBoston took the lead with a minute left in the first period when Jake DeBrusk made a no-look backhanded pass to Zacha to send him on a breakaway. Brandon Carlo also helped by flattening Carter Verhaeghe at the blue line to keep him from pursuing the puck.\n\nBut Florida tied it with seven minutes left in the second, after a scramble in front of the Boston net that left DeBrusk on the ice. Lundell swooped into the slot and swept the puck past Swayman.\n\nScripps Only Content 2024",

        "content": "Dabney Coleman, the mustachioed character actor who specialized in smarmy villains like the chauvinist boss in \"9 to 5\" and the nasty TV director in \"Tootsie,\" has died. He was 92.\n\nColeman died Thursday at his home in Santa Monica, his daughter, Quincy Coleman, said in a statement to The Associated Press. She said he \"took his last earthly breath peacefully and exquisitely.\"\n\nFor two decades, Coleman labored in movies and TV shows as a talented but largely unnoticed performer. That changed abruptly in 1976 when he was cast as the incorrigibly corrupt mayor of the hamlet of Fernwood in \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,\" a satirical soap opera that was so over the top no network would touch it.\n\nProducer Norman Lear finally managed to syndicate the show, which starred Louise Lasser in the title role. It quickly became a cult favorite. Coleman’s character, Mayor Merle Jeeter, was especially popular and his masterful, comic deadpan delivery did not go overlooked by film and network executives.\n\nA six-footer with an ample black mustache, Coleman went on to make his mark in numerous popular films, including as a stressed-out computer scientist in \"War Games,\" Tom Hanks' father in \"You've Got Mail\" and a firefighting official in \"The Towering Inferno.\"\n\nDabney Coleman appears on the set of \"Courting Alex\" at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, Calif., on Jan. 25, 2006.\n\nHe won a Golden Globe for \"The Slap Maxwell Story\" and an Emmy Award for best supporting actor in Peter Levin's 1987 small screen legal drama \"Sworn to Silence.\" Some of his recent credits include \"Ray Donovan\" and a recurring role on \"Boardwalk Empire,\" for which he won two Screen Actors Guild Awards.\n\nIn the groundbreaking 1980 hit \"9 to 5,\" he was the \"sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot\" boss who tormented his unappreciated female underlings — Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton — until they turned the tables on him.\n\nIn 1981, he was Fonda's caring, well-mannered boyfriend, who asks her father (played by her real-life father, Henry Fonda) if he can sleep with her during a visit to her parents' vacation home in \"On Golden Pond.\"\n\nOpposite Dustin Hoffman in \"Tootsie,\" he was the obnoxious director of a daytime soap opera that Hoffman's character joins by pretending to be a woman. Among Coleman's other films were \"North Dallas Forty,\" \"Cloak and Dagger,\" \"Dragnet,\" \"Meet the Applegates,\" \"Inspector Gadget\" and \"Stuart Little.\" He reunited with Hoffman as a land developer in Brad Silberling's \"Moonlight Mile\" with Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\nColeman's obnoxious characters didn’t translate quite as well on television, where he starred in a handful of network comedies. Although some became cult favorites, only one lasted longer than two seasons, and some critics questioned whether a series starring a lead character with absolutely no redeeming qualities could attract a mass audience.\n\n\"Buffalo Bill\" (1983-84) was a good example. It starred Coleman as \"Buffalo Bill\" Bittinger, the smarmy, arrogant, dimwitted daytime talk show host who, unhappy at being relegated to the small-time market of Buffalo, New York, takes it out on everyone around him. Although smartly written and featuring a fine ensemble cast, it lasted only two seasons.\n\nAnother was 1987's \"The Slap Maxwell Story,\" in which Coleman was a failed small-town sportswriter trying to save a faltering marriage while wooing a beautiful young reporter on the side.\n\nDabney Coleman, who stars in NBC's \"Sooner or Later,\" is shown Nov. 14, 1988.\n\nOther failed attempts to find a mass TV audience included \"Apple Pie,\" \"Drexell's Class\" (in which he played an inside trader) and \"Madman of the People,\" another newspaper show in which he clashed this time with his younger boss, who was also his daughter.\n\nHe fared better in a co-starring role in \"The Guardian\" (2001-2004), which had him playing the father of a crooked lawyer. He enjoyed the voice role as Principal Prickly on the Disney animated series \"Recess\" from 1997-2003.\n\nUnderneath all that bravura was a reserved man. Coleman insisted he was really quite shy.\n\n\"I've been shy all my life. Maybe it stems from being the last of four children, all of them very handsome, including a brother who was Tyrone Power-handsome. Maybe it's because my father died when I was 4,\" he told The Associated Press in 1984. \"I was extremely small, just a little guy who was there, the kid who created no trouble. I was attracted to fantasy, and I created games for myself.\"\n\nAs he aged, he also began to put his mark on pompous authority figures, notably in 1998's \"My Date With the President's Daughter,\" in which he was not only an egotistical, self-absorbed president of the United States, but also a clueless father to a teenager girl.\n\nDabney Coleman — his real name — was born in 1932 in Austin, Texas After two years at the Virginia Military Academy, two at the University of Texas and two in the Army, he was a 26-year-old law student when he met another Austin native, Zachry Scott, who starred in \"Mildred Pierce\" and other films.\n\nActor Dabney Coleman poses at his home Sept. 8, 1991, in Brentwood, Calif.\n\n\"He was the most dynamic person I've ever met. He convinced me I should become an actor, and I literally left the next day to study in New York. He didn’t think that was too wise, but I made my decision,\" Coleman told The AP in 1984.\n\nEarly credits included such TV shows as \"Ben Casey,\" \"Dr. Kildare,\" \"The Outer Limits,\" \"Bonanza,\" \"The Mod Squad\" and the film \"The Towering Inferno.\" He appeared on Broadway in 1961 in \"A Call on Kuprin.\" He played Kevin Costner's father on \"Yellowstone.\"\n\nTwice divorced, Coleman is survived by four children, Meghan, Kelly, Randy and Quincy, and the grandchildren Hale and Gabe Torrance, Luie Freundl and Kai and Coleman Biancaniello.\n\n\"My father crafted his time here on earth with a curious mind, a generous heart, and a soul on fire with passion, desire and humor that tickled the funny bone of humanity,\" Quincy Coleman wrote in his honor.\n\nScripps Only Content 2024",

        "content": "Former President Donald Trump will head to Minnesota on a day off from his hush money trial for a Republican fundraiser Friday night in a traditionally Democratic state that he boasts he can carry in November.\n\nTrump will headline the state GOP's annual Lincoln Reagan dinner in St. Paul, which coincides with the party's state convention, after attending his son Barron's high school graduation in Florida. Trump attended the graduation Friday morning with his wife, Melania Trump, and her father, Viktor Knavs.\n\nTrump will use part of the day granted by the trial judge for the graduation to campaign in Minnesota, a state he argues he can win in the November rematch with President Joe Biden. No Republican presidential candidate has won Minnesota since Richard Nixon in 1972, but Trump came close to flipping the state in 2016 when he fell 1.5 percentage points short of Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump returned to Minnesota several times in 2020 when Biden beat him by more than 7 percentage points.\n\n\"I think this is something Trump wants to do. He believes this is a state he can win. We believe that's the case as well,\" David Hann, the chairman of the Republican Party of Minnesota, said in an interview.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota, a Biden ally, said the Trump campaign is \"grasping at straws\" if it thinks he can win the state.\n\n\"The Biden campaign is going to work hard for every vote,\" Smith said in an interview. \"We're going to engage with voters all over the state. But I think Minnesota voters are going to choose President Biden.\"\n\nTrump's youngest son, Barron Trump, graduated from the private Oxbridge Academy in West Palm Beach, Florida. The former president had long complained Judge Juan M. Merchan would not let him attend the graduation before Merchan agreed not to hold court Friday.\n\nHann is co-hosting Friday's dinner along with Trump’s state campaign chair, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, who represents a central Minnesota district. Hann said Emmer was instrumental in bringing the former president to Minnesota.\n\nThe dinner coincides with the party's state convention. Tickets started at $500, ranging up to $100,000 for a VIP table for 10 with three photo opportunities with Trump. Hann declined to say how much money he expects it will raise, but he anticipates a full house of around 1,400 people.\n\nAll the money from the dinner tickets will go to the state party, Hann said, though he added that some money from photo opportunities may go to the Trump campaign.\n\nExperts are split on whether Minnesota really will be competitive this time, given its history and the strong Democratic Party ground game in the state. But Hann said there's \"great dissatisfaction with President Biden\" in the state, noting that nearly 19% of Democratic voters in its Super Tuesday primary marked their ballots for \"uncommitted.\" That was at least partly due to a protest-vote movement over Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war that has spread to several states.\n\nIn an interview aired Wednesday by KSTP-TV of Minneapolis-St. Paul, Trump said his speech would focus on economic issues. He repeated a false claim he made in March to KNSI Radio of St. Cloud that he thought he won Minnesota in 2020, even though there's no evidence that there were any serious irregularities in the state.\n\n\"We think we have a really good shot at Minnesota,\" Trump told KSTP. \"We have great friendships up there. We've done a lot for industry. We've done a lot for everything in Minnesota. Worked hard on Minnesota. Tom Emmer is very much involved.\"\n\nScripps Only Content 2024",

It also received additions over the years including solar panels.\n\nPLANT IS 'WORLD'S FIRST HYBRID SOLAR ENERGY CENTER'\n\nA news release in 2011 celebrated the plant as the world's first hybrid solar energy center.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the plant uses mostly natural gas but solar energy as well to generate power.\n\nA press release also said the facility is about 500 acres.\n\nFPL said the plant connects more than 190,000 solar mirrors with an existing combined natural gas power plant. The mirrors then track the sun to harness fuel and offset fossil fuels.\n\nFlorida Power and Light released the following statement regarding the incident:\n\n\"We are aware of the serious incident Thursday night at FPL's power plant in Indiantown that injured two of our employees.

        "content": "A bill signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis regarding Florida’s energy use is drawing mixed reaction as meteorologists and safety leaders from across the state are in Palm Beach County to prepare for what’s forecasted to be one of the most active hurricane seasons yet.\n\nFlorida HB 1645 takes the phrase \"climate change\" out of state legislation and makes climate change a much lesser priority by restructuring the state's fossil fuel-based energy policy that previously prioritized the changing climate.\n\nIn 2008, Florida lawmakers in both legislative sessions unanimously passed a bill to address climate change and promote renewable energy. HB 1645 removes the word \"climate\" in nine different places, and removes \"climate change\" at least five times.\n\nThe bill also strikes the previous law's focus on increasing energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gases blamed for warming the planet.\n\nIt comes as Accuweather meteorologists previously told WFLX’s Kate Hussey they are predicting an “explosive” hurricane season, forecasting as many as 20 to 25 named storms, four to seven of which could be major hurricanes. Almost all of those are predicted to directly hit the U.S.\n\nCritics fear DeSantis' new bill ignores the reality these dangers pose to Floridians.\n\nColorado State University's top forecaster Phil Klotzbach told Hussey, part of the reason we've seen such active storm seasons is due to chronically rising water temperatures.\n\n“The tropical Atlantic continues to be at record warm temperatures this time of year,” he told Hussey in March. “Warmer waters, mean more fuel for these storms.”\n\nOcean temperatures hit a record high in February, with the average global sea surface temperature hitting just below 70 degrees.\n\nThe Florida Oceanographic Society also blamed exceptionally warm water temperatures as a major contributing factor that fueled blue green algae on the Treasure Coast and along Lake Okeechobee.\n\nEric Roby, executive director of the American Red Cross' Palm Beach and Treasure Coast Chapter, said he's seen the impacts of the changing climate firsthand.\n\n\"The Red Cross does consider what is going on a climate crisis. We consider that by just looking at the number of natural disasters that we’re having. If we just drill down to those natural disasters that do more than a billion dollars worth of damage, adjusted for inflation, we had 28 last year,\" Roby said. \"Reverse all the way to the 1980s, we were only responding, again, comparing apples to apples, adjusting for inflation, to two to three billion dollar disasters a year.\"\n\nThe bill also bans power generating wind turbines offshore or near the state's coastline, which Klotzbach didn't think would be a significant loss to Florida's energy system.\n\n\"There's not a ton of consistent wind across the center of the state,\" Klotzbach said. \"Places like Wyoming? Always windy, great place for wind turbines, Florida's a bit streakier.\"\n\nThe law takes effect July 1 and also boosts the expansion of natural gas. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, natural gas already fuels about three fourths of Florida's energy. Eight out of the state's 10 largest power plants are natural gas-fired, according to the US EIA.\n\nScripps Only Content 2024",

        "content": "A critical conversation continues in Palm Beach County—how do we better prepare for what forecasters are expecting will be active hurricane season?\n\nIt's a discussion that happens every year during the annual Governor's Hurricane Conference as local authorities and meteorologists discuss what we've learned from past storms to help us be ready for the future.\n\nThis time around, as leaders from 65 out of Florida's 67 counties descended on the Palm Beach County Convention Center for the 2024 session, population growth is adding an unexpected challenge.\n\n\"40% to 50%, there’s that many people moving down here from the northeast who have never been through a hurricane before,\" Shane Ratliff, Port St Lucie's emergency operations manager, said.\n\nDiscussing solutions to the issue is one of many reasons Ratliff attended the GHC this year. With Port St. Lucie as one of the fastest growing cities in the nation, Ratliff said it’s critical to learn from other county leaders and figure out how to better communicate with an influx of new residents.\n\n\"It's simplifying the information,\" Ratliff said. \"We want to talk on the level that they’re used to hearing it.\"\n\nMessaging and communication was an emphasis of this year's conference.\n\nIn a panel moderated by our WFLX First Alert Weather Chief Meteorologist Steve Weagle, Director of Florida’s Division of Emergency Management Kevin Guthrie told the crowd in attendance that issuing quick communication via multiple mediums will be key this year, as the National Hurricane Center’s Dr. Michael Brennan displayed data showing the country’s deadliest hurricanes also intensified the fastest.\n\nAccuweather previously told WFLX’s Kate Hussey they’re predicting as many as four to six major hurricanes directly hitting the U.S., with South Florida as one of the regions most at risk for impact.\n\n\"So many lessons learned that they tell you things you would never expect,\" Martin County's Emergency Management Director Sally Waite said.\n\nWaite said she was eager to implement what she's learning from those who have been hit hard by storms themselves, as the time to prepare resources and secure supplies is now.\n\n\"You know, recovery really starts the day the storm comes in,\" Waite said. \"You really got to be ready for all that temporary housing, disaster housing, where do you put people?”\n\nThat seemed to be the conundrum across the region this year: finding disaster housing for a population exponentially larger.\n\n\"How do you approach that?\" Hussey asked Ratliff.\n\n“Disaster housing, any emergency manager will tell you, that’s the hidden thing that everybody worries about, because nobody knows how do we solve the housing market,\" Ratliff said. \"There's not houses out there, apartments are full. You don't have it where there's 70% occupancy and you can use 30% to help people displaced, you just don't have that in Florida.\"\n\nRatliff said the city of Port St. Lucie is working with the state to bring in additional temporary housing in case a hurricane causes a major displacement, and several options for housing were on display at the conference's hurricane expo for emergency managers to browse.\n\n\"We're just like, what don't we have, what do we need, and what do we need more of?\" Waite said.\n\nWaite said the expo is a critical part of the preparation process, especially with so many new residents to communicate with and help recover.\n\nFrom LED message boards to safety equipment for disaster cleanup crews, Waite pointed out you don't always know what you need until you see what you don't have.\n\n\"It’s not only the socializing with directors and staff but just coming here and seeing all the information, you see things, and you’re like, 'Wow, I can really use that,'\" Waite said.\n\nWaite also said the expo isn't just about securing supplies but also about building relationships with local nonprofits and other partners to secure aid and help now. All those who spoke with WPTV told us recovery starts before the storm.\n\n“I think recovery is huge after seeing Ian for most emergency management directors,\" Waite said. \"During Hurricane Ian, I was called over to help, and if I have a storm, I have many directors and emergency management staff that I know all over the state of Florida that would come in, even people outside the state, so that relationship has to be so strong.\"\n\nIt's part of the reason the American Red Cross said they have a booth at the conference too: to build relationships and offer services.\n\n\"You know, it used to be that building relationships was nice and it's something that you should do, but in this day, when you have so many natural disasters back to back and the Red Cross is in a chronic state of deployment for natural disasters, it is crucial, it is critical,\" Eric Roby, executive director of the organization's Palm Beach County and Treasure Coast Chapter, said.\n\nThe Governor's Hurricane Conference runs through May 17 at the Palm Beach County Convention Center.\n\nScripps Only Content 2024",

A police officer who was working off-duty at Sam's Club rushed over to the vehicle to help.\n\n“When our officer got there, she was profusely sweating. She was red, she was flushed, and she was crying,” Mike Jachles, the public information officer for the West Palm Beach Police Department, told WFLX.\n\nMinutes later, after additional police and fire rescue units arrived in the parking lot, Rielo-Fernandez walked out of the store with a \"cart full of merchandise,\" the report stated. When he saw the law enforcement activity, he ran over to his Chevy.\n\nAccording to the arrest report, Rielo-Fernandez told a West Palm Beach police officer he drove to Sam's Club from home and remembered putting his daughter in the SUV, but \"totally forgot that she was inside the car\" when he got to the store.\n\nRielo-Fernandez said \"he had a lot on his mind for Mother's Day shopping and just forgot that he left [the child]\" inside his car, the report said.\n\nWATCH: BODYCAM VIDEO\n\nWest Palm Beach police body camera video shows the moments before a father was arrested after police say he left his 3-year-old daughter alone.\n\nPolice said it appears the girl was inside the hot car for approximately 31 minutes. She was taken to St. Mary's Medical Center for further treatment. Her condition is unknown as of Thursday.\n\n\"To say that this was a close call is an understatement,\" Jachles said.\n\nThe arrest report said a thermometer in a West Palm Beach police officer's car displayed a temperature of 100 degrees outside in the parking lot at the time of the incident.\n\nRielo-Fernandez was booked into the Palm Beach County Jail Saturday evening and was released on his own recognizance on Sunday afternoon. According to court records, a judge ordered the father to have \"no violent contact with the victim.\"\n\nRobert Molleda, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Miami, told WPTV on Thursday that our current record-breaking heat can cause the interior temperature of a car to spike dangerously and quickly.\n\n\"The temperatures inside of a closed vehicle can reach deadly levels in as little as 10 minutes,\" Molleda said.\n\nMolleda said feels-like temperatures this time of year can reach between 105 and 110 degrees.\n\n\"Any amount of time inside an enclosed vehicle is very dangerous. So time is very, very imporant,\" Molleda said. \"So we have to make sure that we always check our vehicles before we step out. Make sure we're not leaving kids or pets behind.\"\n\nDoctor explains dangers of leaving children in hot car\n\nDr. Sara Tano, a pediatric emergency room doctor at Palm Beach Children's Hospital at St. Mary's and West Boca Medical centers, said children's body temperature increases much faster than adults. It could take only 15 minutes to get to a dangerous point which could lead to heat exhaustion or heat stroke.\n\nShe said that can cause \"changes in their mental status, all your organs can start to heat up and they don't function how they are supposed to function and that includes your heart, your lungs, your brain of course and if they are left in there too long and get to a certain temperature, ultimately it can cause a loss of consciousness and unfortunately death, which is obviously our biggest concern.\"\n\n\"It's always best in these cases — they may be acting OK initially but call 911 and have them brought to the hospital so they can be evaluated, just in case,\" she added.\n\nTano suggested that children be dressed in light clothing, keep cars well-ventilated and keep children hydrated during the hot summer months in Florida.\n\nDuring his arrest, Fernandez told officers \"what happens to me, I don't care, [the] most important thing is my daughter is OK.\"\n\nAccording to the Kids and Car Safety database, more than half of the child hot car deaths that occur happen when the child is unknowingly left in the vehicle. Florida ranks second in the country only behind Texas in the number of child hot car deaths.\n\nScripps Only Content 2024",

        "content": "Here is a game-by-game look at the 2024 Miami Dolphins schedule, released Wednesday by the NFL.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (Sept. 8)\n\nJaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence is 2-0 against Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa in their careers. They first faced each other when Lawrence's Clemson steamrolled Tagovailoa's Alabama 44-16 in the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship game. Then they met again in London when the Jaguars snapped a 20-game losing streak with a 23-20 victory in 2021. Can Lawrence keep the streak alive? The Jaguars hold a slight 6-5 edge against Miami all-time, including a 17-7 win on their last visit to Hard Rock Stadium in 2018.\n\nBuffalo Bills (Sept. 12, \"Thursday Night Football\")\n\nThe Dolphins will be looking for payback on \"Thursday Night Football\" after letting the AFC East Division title slip away in a 21-14 loss to the Bills in the final game of the 2023 regular season.\n\nat Seattle Seahawks (Sept. 22)\n\nTwo teams at extreme opposite ends of the country will meet in Seattle, more than 3,000 miles from Miami. Pete Carroll steps into an advisor role in 2024 after 14 seasons as the Seahawks head coach, becoming the all-time wins leader. In his place is former Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator Mike Macdonald (not to be confused with Miami's Mike McDaniel).\n\nTennessee Titans (Sept. 30, \"Monday Night Football\")\n\nThe Dolphins led Tennessee 27-13 in the fourth quarter last December, only to give up two touchdowns in the final minutes as the Titans stunned Miami 28-27 at home. Rookie quarterback Will Levis overcame a fourth-quarter turnover and led the Titans on consecutive scoring drives, capped by Derrick Henry's 3-yard touchdown run and Nick Folk's game-winning extra point. Even though the Titans have moved on from Henry, they've now got a dynamic receiver in Calvin Ridley for Levis to target. Like last season, the teams will have a national audience watching on \"Monday Night Football.\"\n\nat New England Patriots (Oct. 6)\n\nAfter losing 10 straight games at Gillette Stadium between 2009-18, the Dolphins are 3-2 in their last five trips to New England, including last season's 24-17 win. That's when Miami receiver Tyreek Hill called Patriots fans \"some of the worst fans in the NFL.\"\n\nat Indianapolis Colts (Oct. 20)\n\nThe Dolphins and Colts once were divisional foes before the 2002 realignment sent Indianapolis to the AFC South. Miami was 45-21 against the Colts during their old AFC East days, when the teams met twice per season. Since then, however, the Dolphins are just 3-7, including a 27-17 loss when they last played in 2021.\n\nArizona Cardinals (Oct. 27)\n\nDolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threw for 248 yards and two touchdowns in just his second NFL start as Miami rallied for a 34-31 victory when these teams last met in 2020. Miami is 5-1 at home against the Cardinals, who will come to South Florida for the first time since 2016.\n\nat Buffalo Bills (Nov. 3)\n\nThe Bills have pretty much owned Miami in the Josh Allen era. The No. 7 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft is 10-2 against the Dolphins in his career, including a perfect 6-0 mark at home. Buffalo is 8-1 against the Dolphins since 2020 and has won eight consecutive home games in the rivalry, including a 34-31 playoff win during the 2022 season.\n\nat Los Angeles Rams (Nov. 11, \"Monday Night Football\")\n\nThis will be Miami's third consecutive trip to face a Los Angeles team at SoFi Stadium after splitting the past two meetings against the Chargers. In fact, since the Chargers and Rams returned to the L.A. market, the Dolphins are 3-1 in games played there. Miami has won five in a row against the Rams, last losing in St. Louis in 2001.\n\nLas Vegas Raiders (Nov. 17)\n\nThe Raiders are 1-2 against the Dolphins since moving to Las Vegas in 2020. This is the second straight season that the Raiders will face the Dolphins in South Florida. Miami cornerback Jalen Ramsey caught a game-sealing interception in the end zone with 22 seconds left to preserve a 20-13 victory last November. Defensive tackle Christian Wilkins, arguably Miami's top loss in free agency, will make his return to Hard Rock Stadium in a Raiders uniform. He had a career-high nine sacks a season ago.\n\nNew England Patriots (Nov. 24)\n\nFor the first time since 1999, someone other than Bill Belichick will lead the Patriots into Hard Rock Stadium. That man is first-time head coach Jerod Mayo. Miami quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was 5-0 against the Patriots under Belichick. The Dolphins have won four in a row against New England at home, including a 31-17 victory last October.\n\nat Green Bay Packers (Nov. 28, Thanksgiving night on WPTV)\n\nWinning in Green Bay hasn't come easy for the Dolphins in recent years. The Dolphins are just 1-3 in their past four games at Lambeau Field, including a 31-12 loss in 2018. Their lone win in their four previous trips was a 23-20 overtime victory in 2010. Green Bay quarterback Jordan Love threw for 4,159 yards and 32 touchdowns in his first season as a full-time starter after the Packers parted ways with Aaron Rodgers.\n\nNew York Jets (Dec. 8)\n\nAaron Rodgers will presumably make his debut with the Jets a year later than anticipated after a season-ending injury four plays into his New York debut. The former Green Bay quarterback led the Packers to a victory in South Florida on Christmas in 2022, throwing for 238 yards and a touchdown. But his current team hasn't won at Hard Rock Stadium since 2015.\n\nat Houston Texans (Dec. 15)\n\nThe Dolphins are 0-5 in Houston since the NFL resurrected football in that city with the birth of the Texans in 2002. Miami's last win in Houston was in 1996, one year before the Oilers left for Tennessee.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (Dec. 22)\n\nThe 49ers will visit Hard Rock Stadium for the first time since blowing a 10-point fourth-quarter lead against the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIV. Dolphins running back Raheem Mostert scored San Francisco's final touchdown on a 1-yard run late in the third before the Chiefs mounted their comeback. Speaking of the Super Bowl, San Francisco was also Miami's opponent when the Dolphins last played for the Vince Lombardi Trophy to cap the 1984 season.\n\nat Cleveland Browns (Dec. 29, \"Sunday Night Football\" on WPTV)\n\nDolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threw for 285 yards and three touchdowns in a lopsided 39-17 win against the Browns at Hard Rock Stadium in 2022. But that was with Cleveland quarterback Deshaun Watson suspended because of various sexual assault accusations. Watson had season-ending shoulder surgery last November, but he should be ready to go by the start of the season. The Dolphins lost to the Browns 41-24 on their last visit to Cleveland in 2019.\n\nat New York Jets (Jan. 4 or 5)\n\nTrailing 10-6 just before halftime of last year's game at MetLife Stadium, Jets quarterback Tim Boyle heaved a desperation pass toward the end zone in the hopes of putting his team ahead. Instead, Dolphins safety Jevon Holland intercepted the ball at Miami's 1-yard line and returned it 99 yards for a touchdown with no time left on the clock. The Dolphins went on to win 34-13, improving to 7-1 against the Jets since 2020.\n\nThe Dolphins also will host two of the team's three preseason games this season. All three games will be televised on WPTV.\n\n2024 Preseason Schedule\n\nDate\tOpponent\tTime\tTelevision\nAug. 9\tAtlanta Falcons\t7 p.m.\tWPTV\nAug. 17\tWashington Commanders\t7 p.m.\tWPTV\nAug. 23\tat Tampa Bay Buccaneers\t7:30 p.m.\tWPTV\n\nScripps Only Content 2024",

Neighbors said Elan's child was present to witness the aftermath.\n\nSales said it reminds her how important it is to speak up before it's too late.\n\n\"I can tell maybe as a woman how hard it is,\" Sales said, \"to stay quiet and not look for help. She didn't look for her or for her kid. She stayed quiet until she died.\"\n\nCourt documents show Antoine was petitioning for paternity and full custody of the child as recently as last month.\n\nAccording to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, 37.9% of Florida women have experienced intimate partner/domestic violence in their lifetime.\n\nThey also say an abuser's access to guns makes the risk of intimate partner femicide at least five times more likely.\n\nVictim advocates like Bianca DeLoach said there are resources available\n\n\"They have 211.

        "content": "As we get closer to the November elections, WFLX is examining the claims made by the groups spending millions of dollars to sway your vote.\n\nThis week, a group called Smart and Safe Florida spent more than $5 million, blitzing the airwaves with four ads that make multiple claims to convince you to vote “yes” on Amendment 3, which would legalize and regulate recreational marijuana for adults.\n\nHere are the claims:\n\n1. “In Florida, marijuana is already available on the streets.”\n\nThis is true.\n\nWhile marijuana has been available legally with a prescription in Florida since 2017, records show there's still an illegal marijuana market in Florida. FDLE reported 2,329 convictions stemming from marijuana-related charges in 2023. And in an analysis of Amendment 3 published in July, the Florida Financial Impact Estimating Conference predicts if the measure passes, the \"vast majority of anticipated sales are estimated to be from black market users moving to the legal retail market.\"\n\n2. “Most Americans have access to legal marijuana that is regulated and tested for safety.”\n\nThis is also true.\n\nAccording to Pew Research, 54% of the U.S. population lives in a state where recreational marijuana is legal— and therefore, regulated. That number jumps to 74% when states that allow medical marijuana are factored in.\n\n3. “Most Florida marijuana is illegal. It’s produced using toxic chemicals and can be laced with dangerous drugs like fentanyl.”\n\nThis one is harder to fully confirm — since it’s impossible to arrest, survey or otherwise arrest every person who uses marijuana illegally.\n\nMorgan Hill, the spokesperson for Smart and Safe Florida, pointed to the financial analysis to back this claim.\n\n\"Economists project that 1.8 million people every year are accessing marijuana on the illicit market,\" Hill said. \"That's more than double the number of people in the state who currently have those medical marijuana cards.\"\n\nAccording to Florida’s Office of Medical Marijuana use, 878,510 Floridians are authorized to purchase marijuana for medical reasons at one of the state’s 635 dispensaries. The data cited in the Amendment 3 analysis is based on a survey of Florida adults, who were asked to self-report using marijuana illegally. The survey was conducted in 2017, when Florida’s medical marijuana program was in its earliest days.\n\n\"Some of the current illicit use may be for medical purposes,\" said the 2023 report referencing the 2017 study. \"This estimation approach has been used by other states to estimate recreational marijuana use.\"\n\nRegarding the claims of \"toxic chemicals\" and fentanyl, multiplenews reports have referenced marijuana laced with fentanyl. The Florida Department of Health has also raised the issue of fentanyl being detected in marijuana. WPTV has requested data from FDLE and the federal Drug Enforcement Administration regarding fentanyl-laced marijuana, but has not yet received that information.\n\n4. The ads claim revenue from recreational marijuana will bring \"billions for better schools and safer communities.”\n\nThat’s a bit of a stretch. While the ads don’t say how long it’ll take to raise billions in revenue, it’ll likely take years.\n\nThe financial impact audit projects recreational marijuana could bring in between $195 million and $431 million a year in revenue.\n\nStill, there’s no guarantees how much, if any of that, will go to schools and law enforcement. That decision would be left to Florida lawmakers if the ballot measure passes.\n\n\"Education and public safety are two places that we support them using that funding,\" Hill said. \"Certainly, it is up to the legislature.\"\n\nScripps Only Content 2024",

        "content": "There’s a lot of pork in Florida’s next budget — or is that turkey? Nonprofit watchdog Florida TaxWatch is out with its latest Turkey Watch Report, highlighting more concerning spending than ever and urging the governor to consider cuts with his veto pen before signing.\n\nTaxWatch announced its findings during a Wednesday news conference held in Tallahassee. After the annual review of the latest proposed spending plan, about $117.5 billion which lawmakers approved this session, officials found a lot of pork barrel spending.\n\nTaxWatch calls them turkeys— essentially state-funded local projects that lack traditional scrutiny, oversight and review.\n\n\"Look, this is the taxpayer's money,\" former Florida Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp, now a Florida TaxWatch executive vice presidents.\n\nKottkamp noted there were 450 budget turkeys this year or about $855 million worth. That's the most ever, a nearly 43% increase over the previous year. Water projects accounted for more than half.\n\n\"We shouldn't be behind closed doors, sprinkling hundreds of millions of dollars into the budget,\" Kottkamp said. \"We have a process. We have months of committee meetings to vet these projects to have public input, to have a debate on the floor, and that process works.\"\n\nTaxWatch also warned about the proliferation of individual lawmaker projects in general. This year, another record of more than 1,600 of them were approved or about $2.8 billion. That means, on average, each lawmaker is funneling their district about $17 million worth of state cash.\n\nThe House and Senate both had 2,700 member project requests — both over $7 billion,\" Kurt Wenner, Florida TaxWatch senior vice president, said. \"You know, that's way too many to do any kind of thoughtful review. They've got to do something, I think, to limit the number of projects that are requested in the first place.\"\n\nFlorida's governor gets the final say on all this with his veto pen. He's already promised to trim things back a bit, saying this following the conclusion of the session in March.\n\n\"There may have to be a little trimming that is done, but that's how the cookie crumbles,\" Gov. Ron DeSantis said. \"By the time we're done with going over the budget, it is assuredly going to be a net decrease in per-capita spending.\"\n\nIt remains unclear when DeSantis will get out the felt pens and sign the spending plan. It usually happens a few days after the Turkey Report comes out. We do know he's got to have it done by July 1 when the new state budget is set to take effect.\n\nScripps Only Content 2024",

This basketball legend is thriving at pickleball. WFLX caught up with Barry while he competed at the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships in Naples. “My goal was to win the triple crown — play singles and win singles in my age and skill, play men’s doubles and mixed doubles,” he said. “I was able to do that this week.”\n\nBarry is the father of five sons and one daughter. For the boys, basketball could be seen as the family business.\n\n\"To see my boys having a chance to succeed in the sport that was so good to me, that I had great success in, it's just incredible,\" he said.\n\nCanyon Barry is the youngest of Rick's children and still pursuing his hoop dreams. The former Florida Gator will represent Team USA this summer on the men's Olympic 3x3 basketball team along with former NBA player Jimmer Fredette, Kareem Maddox and Dylan Travis.\n\nCanyon spoke about the tense moments before learning he made the team.\n\n\"It was the call to say, 'Hey, congratulations,' or it was the call to say, 'You know, we're so sorry. We've selected a different team,'\" Canyon Barry said. \"But I was lucky that it was the positive side of that coin.\" Together his team has won a silver medal at the 2023 FIBA 3x3 World Cup in Austria, gold at the 2023 Pan American Games and gold at the 2022 FIBA AmeriCup.\n\n\"Those guys have great chemistry. They work well together,\" Rick Barry said. \"I'm so happy the Olympic committee decided to let those guys, who worked so hard for a whole year to get the team qualified, choose them after they had tryouts.\"\n\nRick Barry said out of all his sons, Canyon listened to him most when it came to basketball. All you have to do is watch him shoot a free throw — using Rick's iconic underhand style.\n\n\"He's so freaking smart,\" Rick Barry said. \"He's got his masters in nuclear engineering, a physics degree, so he figured it out that it really is scientifically the most efficient way to do it.\"\n\nCanyon’s support system in the quest for gold includes WFLX First Alert Weather meteorologist Frances Peyton. She’s been there on and off the court as Canyon’s pursued his Olympic dream.\n\n\"I like started to understand the importance because of the sacrifices that he made not only for his job and sleep and health, but he's also making personal sacrifices like missing a best friend's wedding, missing things with his family, missing things with me,\" Peyton said.\n\nPeyton said the journey continues to bring them closer.\n\n\"It's just a special moment to see someone hit a pinnacle in their life and be part of that memory is really special,\" Peyton said. \"He's also he's such a great guy, and he's worked so hard.\"\n\nBack at the pickleball court, Rick Barry is hopeful that his son's Olympic journey brings a podium finish in Paris. \"Nothing would make me happier than to see him standing on that podium,\" he said.\n\nScripps Only Content 2024",

        "content": "A fatal bus accident in Marion County is now shedding additional light on transportation inequities among migrant communities, particularly across Florida.\n\nTuesday, authorities said a bus carrying farmworkers collided with a pickup truck and overturned in central Florida, killing eight people and injuring about 40 other passengers.\n\nThe bus was transporting 53 farmworkers at about 6:40 a.m. when it collided with a truck in Marion County, about 80 miles north of Orlando, the Florida Highway Patrol said.\n\nAccording to data from the U.S. Department of Labor, transportation accidents are the most frequent type of workplace fatality, accounting for 37.7% of all occupational fatalities. There were 2,066 fatal injuries from transportation incidents in 2022, a 4.2% increase from 1,982 in 2021.\n\nAdditionally, USDOL statistics showed transportation incidents were the highest cause of fatalities within minority groups, with 278 for Black or African American workers and 439 for Hispanic or Latino workers.\n\nData shows foreign-born Hispanic or Latino workers accounted for 63.5% (792) of total Hispanic or Latino worker fatalities (1,248). Fatalities in the construction industry accounted for 316 of the 792 foreign-born Hispanic or Latino worker deaths in 2022.\n\nAttorney Bill Zoeller has advocated on behalf of immigrants and their families in similar cases, and told WFLX’s Dave Bohman many of the buses agricultural immigrant workers take to the fields aren’t well maintained, and said many of their drivers aren’t well trained.\n\nThe Florida Immigrant Coalition is now renewing calls for equal transportation standards.\n\n\"It not only brings up questions of equity but it also brings up questions of humanization,\" said Florida Immigrant Coalition's Yareliz Mendez-Yamora. \"We know that for so long, immigrants have been demonized in the state of Florida, and it takes a tragedy of this scale to see people as human, where at least eight folks have died.

        "content": "Jeremy Swayman backed up his victory vow with 28 saves, Charlie McAvoy added to the list of disputed goals in this matchup with the go-ahead score and the Boston Bruins staved off elimination by beating the Florida Panthers 2-1 in Game 5 of their NHL playoff series on Tuesday night.\n\nMorgan Geekie also scored for the Bruins, who improved to 2-0 in elimination games this season — they also won a Game 7 over Toronto in Round 1 — and finally found a way to hold the Panthers’ offense in check.\n\nSam Reinhart scored for Florida, and Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 26 shots.\n\nFlorida — which saw its series lead cut to 3-2 — had 15 goals on 107 shots in Games 2, 3 and 4 combined, all of them Panthers wins. But on Tuesday, the Panthers were held to 29 shots and Swayman looked in total control the whole way.\n\nGame 6 is in Boston on Friday. Game 7, if necessary, would be back in Florida on Sunday.\n\n\"The reality is that we’re going to go to Florida and we're going to play the same game and we're going to get it done,\" Swayman said after Game 4. \"I have no doubt in this group. And we have a lot of confidence and a lot of motivation to bring it back to Boston.\"\n\nIt's going back to Boston.\n\nBobrovsky was pulled with 3:05 left, Florida going 6-on-5 to try to tie the game but managed to get only three pucks to Swayman the rest of the way.\n\nThe Bruins played the second straight game without their captain and leading scorer Brad Marchand, who hasn't been on the ice since late in the second period of Game 3 because of what Boston is calling an upper-body injury. He was hit by Florida's Sam Bennett and wound up leaving that game, a play that the Bruins said was dirty and has only added to the intensity of the series.\n\nDown 1-0 in the second, Panthers coach Paul Maurice gathered his team around the Florida bench during a TV timeout and used that stoppage in play to get some thoughts out — at high volume. Red-faced by the time his rant was over, Maurice was pointing animatedly and had the attention of everyone from players to assistant coaches to even the team's equipment staff.\n\nMessage received. Only 11 seconds after play resumed, Reinhart lifted a rebound past Swayman to tie the game at 1-1.\n\nBut Boston had the lead again when the second period ended after McAvoy scored a goal midway through the frame where Florida — just like the Bruins did on a big goal for the Panthers in Game 4 — claimed interference. Boston's Danton Heinen made contact with Bobrovsky with his stick, but NHL officials in Toronto said it wasn't enough to take the goal off the board.\n\nScripps Only Content 2024",

        "content": "An airport meant to relieve jets from Palm Beach International Airport is scaring off pilots due to its small runway, according to county officials.\n\nTheir solution: extend the North County Airport's runway. But people within the radius of the airport expressed concerns about the increase in noise.\n\nPBIA Director Laura Beebe said it's a necessary sacrifice to boost economic development in the county.\n\n\"There will be an increase in airport activity,\" Beebe said. \"But it's not going to be a significant increase in activity.\"\n\nThe county and city of Palm Beach Gardens worked on the proposal since 2016. The county approved a master plan, which included extending the crossing runway (14/32) from 4,300 feet to 6,000 feet in 2016. The runway would also get wider from 75 feet to 100 feet. The county also applied for an air traffic tower, which the FAA approved in 2019.\n\nThe county completed an environmental assessment process, which people can now comment on the proposal. Tuesday's meeting is part of the process to extend the runway.\n\nBeebe said the current runway creates problems for certain corporate planes. In May, she told the Palm Beach Gardens City Council this means pilots land at other airports.\n\n\"While smaller and some mid-size corporate jets operate at the North County Airport, pilots may be required to reduce the number of passengers the amount of payload and/or the amount of fuel to depart from the North County Airport based on environmental conditions,\" Bebee said. \"Mid-size corporate jets may elect to use alternative airports due to operational limitations or not able to use it based on runway length at all.\"\n\nShe said at the meeting the North County Airport is not a \"true reliever for the airport.\" Beebe also said the project at the North County Airport isn't related to the project at PBIA.\n\nAccording to previous WFLX reporting, the county airport department also wants to extend a runway at PBIA primarily used for jets.\n\n\"PBI essentially operates as a single-runway airport on busy days,\" Beebe told commissioners in April 2023. \"You can't land and take off aircraft when you have an intersection.\"\n\nThe proposal would give PBIA a second runway for commercial planes, which would increase the airport's maximum capacity. PBIA is expected to hit its current maximum capacity between 2028 and 2032 with its current airfield configuration since it includes an intersection.\n\nMost attendees told WFLX they were concerned with the development at the North County Airport. They said they were more concerned with the need for emergency services and the way their animals would react to the noise.\n\n\"Having day-in and day-out noise is really disturbing to all of our communities,\" one attendee said. \"Our animals and vet bills are out of control.\"\n\nAnn Moehlenkamp, who said she lives near the airport, said she's also concerned about her horses and the increased noise. She said she thinks the development is going to destroy her way of life.\n\n\"My biggest fear is that we are going to get a lot of noise that's going to destroy that peace and paradise,\" Moehlenkamp said.\n\nScripps Only Content 2024",

The Sun Prairie mom feels it’s been an ongoing struggle to afford childcare for her two children.\n\n“The costs are unaffordable for a lot of families,” Dicks said. “We’re fighting for affordable child care.”\n\nDicks’ children are five and nine years old. Dicks said she’s been paying for child care since 2014.\n\n“Care is inching up towards $1,500 a month,” Dicks said.\n\nDicks added that the cost of childcare takes up nearly 25% of her family’s monthly income. Dicks works a full-time job and owns a small business with her husband, but the cost of care almost had Dicks reconsider her career plans.\n\n“It’s incredibly difficult because you have to weigh, ‘Should I continue working, or should I maybe take a break from my career?’” Dicks said. “But I didn’t want to take a break.”\n\nRallying for expanded access and improved affordability for child care in Wisconsin, Dicks hopes state legislators hear her voice and others.\n\n“We need them to understand what parents are up against,” Dicks said. “The costs are incredibly high.”\n\nState Representative Lisa Subeck (D-Madison), a former childcare provider herself, called for other lawmakers to take action.\n\n“We here at the state legislature need to be involved,” Rep. Subeck said. “Our counterparts at the federal level in Congress need to be involved because this isn’t a problem that’s going to fix itself.”\n\nSome of the same state leaders and organizers at Saturday’s rally also observed “Day without Child Care” on May 13.\n\nClick here to download the WMTV15 News app or our WMTV15 First Alert weather app.\n\nCopyright 2024 WMTV.

(WBAY) - State Republicans gathered on Saturday for their convention in Appleton, laying the groundwork for the upcoming Fall campaign.\n\nThe event also raised questions about the party’s finances and unity when it comes to support for presidential candidate Donald Trump, and assembly speaker Robin Vos, who is now facing a second recall effort.\n\nWith Republicans from every Wisconsin county gathering at the Fox Cities Exhibition Center on Saturday, it was Senator Ron Johnson who was among the first to address delegates, saying he’s not convinced President Joe Biden will be on the ballot this November.\n\n“We are ground zero in terms of battleground states,” said Sen. Johnson. “It is so crucial that we make sure Wisconsin’s ten electoral votes get assigned to President Trump, not some Democrat nominee, whoever that may be.”\n\nOne Republican noticeably absent was Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, who was booed at previous GOP state conventions and is now facing a second potential recall effort.\n\nIn the race for U.S. Senate, Eric Hovde was officially endorsed and also took aim at the media.\n\n“Look I believe a democracy requires a vibrant and strong press, but to be that, you have to be fair and balanced,” said Hovde. “Hold me accountable, ask me hard questions, but do the same to Senator Baldwin, please.”\n\nAt the time of this convention, state Republicans are at a significant disadvantage to Democrats, when it comes to fundraising. The party chair vowed to make that money up between now and November.\n\n“The truth of the matter here is this is not a 50-state campaign. It’s a seven-state campaign, and Wisconsin is one of those seven states,” said Brian Schimming, the chair of the Republican Party of Wisconsin. “So I’m confident we will have the resources we need and as you can tell from the crowd here today we definitely have the energy we need.”\n\nAcross the aisle, Democrats disagree and have out-raised Republicans by a margin of nearly 15 to 1 through the end of March according to WisPolitics.\n\n“The Republican Party of Wisconsin is bankrupt in every sense of the word,” said Ben Wikler, the chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party. “They’re broke, they’re beholden to Donald Trump, and his bankrupt ideas and they’re politically bankrupt representing an extreme agenda that has no residence with the people of Wisconsin.”\n\nDemocrats will hold their state convention on the weekend of June 8th in Milwaukee, just five weeks ahead of the Republican National Convention in that same city.\n\nCopyright 2024 WBAY.

One of the students in the group, a relative of Savage, said that Savage was out on bail at the time and was trying to buy mace.\n\nSavage pleaded not guilty in July of 2023.\n\nClick here to download the WMTV15 News app or our WMTV15 First Alert weather app.\n\nCopyright 2024 WMTV.

        "content": "MADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - Through a bill signed by the governor in February, top students at high schools across Wisconsin will be guaranteed to get into a Wisconsin university.\n\nThrough Senate Bill 367, now Wisconsin Act 95, Universities of Wisconsin is offering certain high schoolers in the state some assurance.\n\nThrough The Wisconsin Guarantee, the top 5% of college-bound seniors at participating high schools can make an early commitment to any UW school. Students in the top 10% will be automatically admitted to any UW school they choose except UW-Madison, which is not guaranteed.\n\n“So it’s really kind of providing that assurance that our best and brightest have a place at a UW,” Associate Vice President for Enrollment & Student Success Julie Amon said. “Hopefully it kind of gives them a sense of confidence and realizing that their hard work is paying off and that they do have opportunities.”\n\nAmon adds those students are only guaranteed admission to the university at large. They have to work just as hard through their senior year to get into the exact program they want.\n\n“So there may be specific majors, academic programs, schools or colleges at a specific UW that then have a separate kind of criteria to get into those.,” she said. “We need them to put their best foot forward to be able to see if, based on their overall experiences and their academic performance, if they get into some of those, programs that might be a little bit more selective.”\n\nThe Wisconsin Guarantee will begin for the class of 2025. Amon says they are currently looking at juniors who are just finishing their school year.\n\n“We want to make sure that all of our Wisconsin residents know that there’s a place for them at a UW,” Amon said. “And we’re excited to try to make that as easy as possible to get in and experience all the great opportunities that we have across the Universities of Wisconsin.”\n\nIn the summer, Universities of Wisconsin rolled out Direct Admit Wisconsin. Through the initiative, administrators hope to reach high school students in the state who might not be considering college by connecting them with one of their 13 campuses.\n\nClick here to download the WMTV15 News app or our WMTV15 First Alert weather app.\n\nCopyright 2024 WMTV.

(WMTV) - An Illinois police sergeant will not face charges in the deadly shooting of a suspect in mid-March near the Wisconsin-Illinois border, the Rock County District Attorney’s Office stated on Friday.\n\nRoscoe Police Department Sergeant Robert Lewis acted lawfully and in line with his duties as an officer, Rock Co. District Attorney David O’Leary stated. The DA further stated that Sgt. Lewis acted in self-defense and to protect the lives of others.\n\nDA O’Leary reviewed police reports, body camera and squad video, photographs and witness statements before making the conclusion.\n\nSouth Beloit Police Department officers pulled over the vehicle the suspect, identified as Ray Castro, was a passenger in around 9:10 a.m. on Saturday, March 16. Police determined Castro, 19, had outstanding felony warrants and attempted to arrest him, but Castro allegedly wrestled with officers and pulled one of them into the vehicle.\n\nThe officer reached into the vehicle to try to turn off the ignition, and officials reported Castro started the vehicle, put it in drive and told the driver to hit the gas. The vehicle pulled away and the officer was pinned inside of the vehicle. Another officer was nearly hit as it pulled away, the report noted.\n\nThe officer pinned inside the vehicle shot the driver in the leg during the struggle, which caused the car to drive into a ditch. Castro allegedly got away after officers tried to use a taser on him.\n\nPolice said Castro ran away to local bar Macktown Lounge where he allegedly robbed a man at knifepoint and stole a car to get away from them.\n\nOfficers later found him driving away from the lounge’s parking lot and chased him at speeds over 90 mph. An officer hit the back of Castro’s vehicle, causing it to spin around and become behind the squad.\n\nSgt. Lewis stopped his vehicle and pointed a gun at Castro’s vehicle as it accelerated, reportedly causing the tires to smoke. The DA’s Office stated Castro spun his vehicle around so it was headed toward the driver’s side of Sgt. Lewis’ squad and Sgt. Lewis reported firing several rounds into Castro’s vehicle. As his squad was being struck by Castro’s vehicle, Sgt. Lewis fired more rounds toward Castro, hitting him.\n\nDA O’Leary’s report concluded Castro was shot as a result of his actions reported by officials.\n\nThe Winnebago Boone County Integrity Task Force was handling the investigation into the initial police shooting that happened in South Beloit.\n\nClick here to download the WMTV15 News app or our WMTV15 First Alert weather app.\n\nCopyright 2024 WMTV.

        "content": "MADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - State legislators are once again pushing to create a task force focusing on missing and murdered African American women and girls in Wisconsin.\n\nA bill to create this passed in the state Assembly back in February, but it failed to make it to the Senate floor despite bipartisan support.\n\nRepresentative Shelia Stubbs is the author behind the bill. She and other lawmakers held a press conference at the State Capitol Thursday urging the Senate to reconvene and schedule a floor vote.\n\n“How much longer must families of missing persons in our state wait for justice,” Rep. Stubbs said.\n\nAmong those waiting for their loved ones to come back home is Tanesha Howard. Howard’s daughter, Joniah Walker, has been missing from Milwaukee since June of 2022.\n\n“I take it literally minute by minute,” Howard said. “It’s like a nightmare that never ends. She’s out there somewhere and somebody knows something. I have faith that she’s still alive, that she’s out there.”\n\nAs of 2020, Wisconsin had the highest homicide victimization rate for black women and girls in the United States at 20.2 out of every 100,000, according to The Guardian.\n\n“I was shocked to discover that Wisconsin, a state that I love, the state that I’m raising my children in, the state where my husband and I are pastors in, the state where my mother brought me to be raised since the age of 5, had the worst numbers for black female homicide victimization in the nation,” Rep. Stubbs said.\n\nThe MMAAWG task force would aim to develop strategies to prevent violence, improve investigations and support families impacted by missing or murdered black women and girls in Wisconsin.\n\n“I employ everyone to join me in this effort until something is done about this issue in the great state of Wisconsin,” Rep. Stubbs said.\n\nThe bill would require Attorney General Josh Kaul to establish the task force within 45 days of the proposal becoming law.\n\nThe task force is similar to the Wisconsin Department of Justice’s missing and murdered indigenous women task force created by Kaul in 2020. Kaul does have the ability to create the proposed MMAAWG task force without a Senate vote.\n\nRep. Stubbs said she spoke to Kaul about him taking this action, but Kaul told her funding for the task force would be a problem.\n\n“I can say to you from many conversations, funding is an issue and at this point, I don’t care that funding is an issue,” Rep. Stubbs said. “I want something done now.”\n\nState Senator Duey Stroebel, who is the GOP chair of the Senate Government Operations Committee, responded to Stubbs’ press conference Thursday. Sen. Stroebel said he would not give the bill a hearing.\n\nClick here to download the WMTV15 News app or our WMTV15 First Alert weather app.\n\nCopyright 2024 WMTV. All rights reserved.",

(WMTV) - FAFSA applications reached a new low as high school seniors try to submit their forms through a new portal process.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Education, submissions for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) dropped down 33.9% from 2023.\n\nHigh school counselors, college finance experts and elected officials all said the new application process is to blame for the low turnout.\n\n”The problem is the form,” La Follette High School Academic Career Planning Coordinator Annie Hand Braga said. “There have been all of the things that were promised with this better FAFSA that students would be able to do, they just haven’t all materialized or they didn’t materialize when the form opened.”\n\nBraga and La Follette High School Multilingual Counselor Vanessa Hlavacka work with students and their parents to help them go through the financial aid process. The two said some students would not be able to attend college without help from the federal government.\n\n”When we were finally able to submit, it brought me to happy tears for this student just knowing what it means for him and his family,” Hlvacka said. “It’s life changing for so many people. Even without those kinds of scholarships in mind, just the opportunity to see what kind of financial support is out there from the government, makes college attainable for many of our students.”\n\nFAFSA form 2024(Source: WWNY)\n\nThe U.S. Dept. of Ed. rolled out a new online application portal this year to make the process simpler. Under Secretary James Kvall acknowledged the new format did not go as planned.\n\n“We have had some bumps get in there this year,” he said. ”It’s required us to replace up to 20 computer systems. Some of which are older than the parents that are filling out the form. So, it’s a major major IT project for us and it has been a challenging one.”\n\nHe said Congress voted to make legislative changes with FAFSA in 2020 and this was part of the result. When asked what his department is doing to improve things, he said they’ve made significant progression over the last few weeks. “We’ve made a lot of progress within the last few weeks,” he said. “The FAFSA is now up and running smoothly. We’ve had about 9 million people submit their FAFSA and we’re processing them in about one to three days.”\n\nUW Madison Assistant Director of Federal Rewards Katy Weisenburger said her office is working to extend deadlines for students who, to know fault of their own, couldn’t make the FAFSA process work.\n\n”I have seen a lot of students be very discouraged, yes, for sure…. I have had parents crying about not being able to get this done,” she said. “It’s a really awful situation. I would not be surprised if some students choose to not apply for financial aid or choose to not go to school because of this situation, which is really sad.”\n\nWeisenburger said college hopefuls and their parents should continue to reach out to the FAFSA helpline and call their desired school’s financial aid offices to request deadlines.\n\nUW Madison’s Financial Aid Office can be reached at 608-262-3060 for help.\n\nClick here to download the WMTV15 News app or our WMTV15 First Alert weather app.\n\nCopyright 2024 WMTV.

Sheriff’s Office says they asked the Ozaukee Co. Sheriff’s Office to take over the case due to Siegmann being critical of Dodge Co. law enforcement in the past.\n\nOzaukee Co.

Jail roster.\n\nHis preliminary hearing is scheduled for June 20th.\n\nHere is the full statement from the district:\n\nDear Families:\n\nI am writing to update you about a situation that took place on school grounds yesterday.\n\nAt approximately 3:00 pm, a Herman-Neosho-Rubicon School District board member attended a scheduled\n\nmeeting at the Honor Elementary District Office. The board member checked in as a visitor, as per normal\n\nprocedure. During the meeting, the board member noticed that the concealed gun they were licensed to carry\n\nwas not removed before they walked into the school. After notifying me of this, I followed policy and\n\nimmediately escorted the board member to their vehicle, and they drove off the school grounds.\n\nAt no time did the board member pose any kind of threat, and the board member agreed to be escorted out of\n\nthe school. Also, as per policy, I contacted local law enforcement to inform them of the situation. We are in\n\nfull cooperation with the Dodge County Police Department as they continue this investigation. At this time, I\n\nam not aware of any charges or tickets issued by law enforcement.\n\nThe board member involved in the situation has voluntarily resigned from their position with the\n\nHerman-Neosho-Rubicon School District.\n\nThank you for your attention to this communication.\n\nSincerely,\n\nChris Nesemann, District Administrator\n\nClick here to download the WMTV15 News app or our WMTV15 First Alert weather app.\n\nCopyright 2024 WMTV.

        "content": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Wisconsin election officials voted Thursday to provide more details to voters than normal to avoid confusion about a ballot that will have both a special and regular election for a vacant congressional seat.\n\nThe rare anomaly for the 8th Congressional District is due to the timing of former U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher’s surprise resignation. Under state law, if Gallagher had quit before April 9, a special election before November would have had to be called.\n\nGallagher quit on April 24, which required Gov. Tony Evers to call the special election on the same dates as the Aug. 13 primary and Nov. 5 general election.\n\nThat means that voters in the northeastern Wisconsin congressional district will be voting to elect someone in a special election to fill the remainder of the current term, which runs until Jan. 3, and then vote separately for someone to fill the regular two-year term starting in January.\n\n“There is a source for confusion present here and it will be very difficult to avoid any voter confusion,” said Wisconsin Elections Commission attorney Brandon Hunzicker at a meeting Thursday.\n\nTo help avoid confusion, the commission voted to have the ballot show the length of both the special election and the regular term. Voters in the congressional district will also be handed an explanation of why the same congressional seat is on the ballot twice.\n\nThe exact wording of both the ballot and the information sheet will be considered by the commission next month.\n\n“If we’re not clarifying that for the voter, we have done the voters a disservice,” commissioner Ann Jacobs said.\n\nCandidates for the office will also be required to circulate separate nomination papers for both the special and regular elections. Those nomination papers are due June 3.\n\nState Sen. André Jacque, of De Pere, former state Sen. Roger Roth, of Appleton, and former gas station and convenience store owner Tony Wied, are all running as Republicans for the seat. Wied has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump.\n\nDr. Kristin Lyerly is the only announced Democrat in the race.\n\nWisconsin’s 8th Congressional District is solidly Republican, but Democrats have vowed to make it competitive.\n\nTrump won the district by 16 percentage points in 2020, even though he lost the state by less than a point to President Joe Biden. Gallagher won reelection three times by no fewer than 25 points. The district includes the cities of Appleton and Green Bay, Door County and covers mostly rural areas north through Marinette.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.",

Carrying a firearm in a school without the proper authority to do so in light of the school shootings that occur in our country is unacceptable.”\n\nClick here to download the WMTV15 News app or our WMTV15 First Alert weather app.\n\nCopyright 2024 WMTV.

        "content": "MADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - A team of DNA lab technicians and bioinformatic experts worked with a single hair from 1989 and online genealogy matching databases to identify Chimney Doe.\n\nDNA lab experts broke down a rootless hair found with Ronnie Joe Kirk’s bones and then matched it with his relatives online to identify his remains. On Monday, the Madison Police Department shared Kirk’s identity, a discovery made this year after a decades long investigation. Kirk’s skeletal remains were found inside a Madison music store’s chimney in September of 1989.\n\nA team of forensic scientists made the identification possible through their volunteer organization called the DNA Doe Project.\n\nThe DNA matching process behind identifying Chimney Doe(Marcus Aarsvold)\n\n”Everyone deserves to have their name in death,” DNA Doe Project Lab Logistics Director Kevin Lord said. “Often times this does help lead to some form of justice.”\n\nLord said the rootless hair from Kirk’s remains proved the most challenging part of trying to identify him. “It’s often too fragmented to use the traditional forensic methods that they use in crime labs,” he said. “It’s very degraded. It’s lots of very small DNA fragments.”\n\nLord’s team sent the hair to a lab in California where it was broken down into Kirk’s own unique DNA and then put together as a genetic sequence, then sent back to Lord who matched it online using databases GenMatch and Family Tree DNA.\n\n”So the bio-informatics process essentially makes sense of of all of those small fragments of DNA,” he said. “So, it assembles them basically, into that persons genome. Then we look at the various spots or snips that we actually care about for the genealogy purposes and essentially pull those snips out of the whole genome data that we have. Then create a file that can then be uploaded.”\n\nAfter more than 34 years, authorities have successfully identified Dane County Chimney Doe as Ronnie Joe Kirk, originally from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Kirk's last known ties were in Madison, Wisconsin. The identification was made possible through the collaborative efforts of law enforcement, forensic experts, and the DNA Doe Project, employing investigative genetic genealogy.(WMTV)\n\nMadison Police Chief Shon Barnes said the process is crucial in helping investigators find out what happened to Kirk. He said it could lead to new clues as to how Kirk ended up inside of a 12-inch-wide chimney.\n\n”People can come forward and say, ‘Hey, that was my family member. We last saw him or her on this time,’ Or what they may have been involved in,” Chief Barnes said. “It does help paint the picture for our detectives.”\n\nLord said the work is rewarding when it results in an identification like Kirk’s situation.\n\nThe DNA matching process behind identifying Chimney Doe(Marcus Aarsvold)\n\n”By identifying the person, then that allows law enforcement also to work on their criminal investigation and also get justice for that person,” Lord said.\n\nDNA Doe Project works on 25 to 50 cases across North America every year. According to Lord, they’ve helped identify 200 people since they started online genetic matching seven years ago.\n\nClick here to download the WMTV15 News app or our WMTV15 First Alert weather app.\n\nCopyright 2024 WMTV.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The number of U.S. fatal overdoses fell last year, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data posted Wednesday.\n\nAgency officials noted the data is provisional and could change after more analysis, but that they still expect a drop when the final counts are in. It would be only the second annual decline since the current national drug death epidemic began more than three decades ago.\n\nExperts reacted cautiously. One described the decline as relatively small, and said it should be thought more as part of a leveling off than a decrease. Another noted that the last time a decline occurred — in 2018 — drug deaths shot up in the years that followed.\n\n“Any decline is encouraging,” said Brandon Marshall, a Brown University researcher who studies overdose trends. “But I think it’s certainly premature to celebrate or to draw any large-scale conclusions about where we may be headed long-term with this crisis.”\n\nIt’s also too soon to know what spurred the decline, Marshall and other experts said. Explanations could include shifts in the drug supply, expansion of overdose prevention and addiction treatment, and the grim possibility that the epidemic has killed so many that now there are basically fewer people to kill.\n\nCDC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Deb Houry called the dip “heartening news” and praised efforts to reduce the tally, but she noted “there are still families and friends losing their loved ones to drug overdoses at staggering numbers.”\n\nAbout 107,500 people died of overdoses in the U.S. last year, including both American citizens and non-citizens who were in the country at the time they died, the CDC estimated. That’s down 3% from 2022, when there were an estimated 111,000 such deaths, the agency said.\n\nThe drug overdose epidemic, which has killed more than 1 million people since 1999, has had many ripple effects. For example, a study published last week in JAMA Psychiatry estimated that more than 321,000 U.S. children lost a parent to a fatal drug overdose from 2011 to 2021.\n\n“These children need support,” and are at a higher risk of mental health and drug use disorders themselves, said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which helped lead the study. “It’s not just a loss of a person. It’s also the implications that loss has for the family left behind.”\n\nPrescription painkillers once drove the nation’s overdose epidemic, but they were supplanted years ago by heroin and more recently by illegal fentanyl. The dangerously powerful opioid was developed to treat intense pain from ailments like cancer but has increasingly been mixed with other drugs in the illicit drug supply.\n\nFor years, fentanyl was frequently injected, but increasingly it’s being smoked or mixed into counterfeit pills.\n\nA study published last week found that law enforcement seizures of pills containing fentanyl are rising dramatically, jumping from 44 million in 2022 to more than 115 million last year.\n\nIt’s possible that the seizures indicate that the overall supply of fentanyl-laced pills is growing fast, not necessarily that police are whittling down the illicit drug supply, said one of the paper’s authors, Dr. Daniel Ciccarone of the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nHe noted that the decline in overdoses was not uniform. All but two of the states in the eastern half of the U.S. saw declines, but most western states saw increases. Alaska, Washington, and Oregon each saw 27% increases.\n\nThe reason? Many eastern states have been dealing with fentanyl for about a decade, while it’s reached western states more recently, Ciccarone said.\n\nNevertheless, some researchers say there are reasons to be optimistic. It’s possible that smoking fentanyl is not as lethal as injecting it, but scientists are still exploring that question.\n\nMeanwhile, more money is becoming available to treat addiction and prevent overdoses, through government funding and also through legal settlements with drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies, Ciccarone noted.\n\n“My hope is 2023 is the beginning of a turning point,” he said.\n\n___\n\nAP medical writer Carla K.

If paid, he cannot have any contact with the man he allegedly shot, he cannot go to Reindahl Park or possess any firearms.\n\nAccording to the released criminal complaint, Moses and another man fought over a parking spot.\n\nMoses allegedly parked in a spot that was previously occupied by a man and his acquaintance.

The Wisconsin DNR says the project is tentatively approved and has received an initial application.\n\nThe department is in the process of reviewing the application internally, which includes asking for more information regarding design updates before making a permit decision.\n\n“The goal of our state wetlands requirements is to avoid wetlands first,” Von Holdt said. “When an applicant shows that they can’t avoid the wetland then the state requires that you minimize. So we’ve worked really hard with the consultant and the applicant to really evaluate what alternatives they have.”\n\nThe comment period ends on May 19.

(AP) — Utility companies have started construction on a contentious power line crossing in a Mississippi River wildlife refuge.\n\nITC Midwest and Dairyland Power Cooperative are looking to string the final mile (1.6 kilometers) of the Cardinal-Hickory Creek transmission line across the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge near Cassville, Wisconsin. When finished, the 102-mile (164 kilometer) line will link Iowa’s Dubuqe County and Wisconsin’s Dane County.\n\nA coalition of conservation groups sued in March to block the refuge crossing and won a preliminary injunction from U.S. District Judge William Conley. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the injunction on May 7, however, clearing the way for construction to begin. The utilities said in a joint statement that preliminary construction work began Monday with tower footings slated to be poured the week of May 27.\n\nThe conservationists have asked Conley to issue another preliminary injunction. Conley held a hearing on the request Tuesday but didn’t rule on it. He said he remains concerned about damage the line could cause to the refuge but the reality is the line will be completed and cause damage somewhere.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "content": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The Republican-controlled Wisconsin Senate voted Tuesday to override nine vetoes of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in a mostly symbolic move that comes less than six months before the November election.\n\nThe overrides included bills combatting PFAS pollution, setting a population goal for gray wolves and requiring a new post-election audit.\n\nBut despite the Senate’s votes, all of Evers’ overrides are likely to stand.\n\nTo be successful, two-thirds of both the Senate and Assembly must vote to override a veto. Republicans have a two-thirds majority in the Senate, but they are short of that in the Assembly. There are no immediate plans for the Assembly to hold a vote and Republican leaders there did not return messages Tuesday.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Spreitzer said lawmakers were “wasting time” on overrides that Republicans “know won’t be sustained.”\n\nEven though the overrides appear ultimately to be doomed, the votes will give Republicans fodder for the campaign trail to use against Democrats.\n\nOne of the most contentious ongoing fights between Republicans and Evers was the focus of one override.\n\nThe Senate voted to override the veto of a bill that would have created grants to spend $125 million fighting pollution from “forever chemicals” known as PFAS.\n\nEvers and Republicans have not been able to agree on the best way to combat pollution from PFAS, chemicals that have polluted groundwater in communities across the state. Evers and Republicans have both said that fighting the chemicals is a priority, but they haven’t been able to come together on what to do about it.\n\n“We’ve done nothing on PFAS,” said Democratic Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein. “Worse than nothing.”\n\nShe urged Republicans to “get the dollars out the door.”\n\nRepublican Sen. Mary Felzkowski accused Democrats of playing politics over PFAS funding.\n\n“You’re playing with peoples lives, their investments and their families,” she said. “And it’s time to stop.”\n\nEvers has repeatedly called on lawmakers to release the $125 million in funding approved last year in the state budget. But Republicans object to handing the money over to the state Department of Natural Resources and instead want to funnel it through the grant program created under the bill Evers vetoed.\n\nRepublican Sen. Eric Wimberger said doing what Evers wants would give the state DNR a “slush fund” that wouldn’t protect innocent landowners from lawsuits, fines and other harm.\n\nThe bill Evers vetoed called for spending the money on grants for municipalities, private landowners and waste disposal facilities to test for PFAS in water treatment plants and wells. Landowners with property that became contaminated through no fault of their own also would have been eligible for grants.\n\nEvers said in his veto message that he objected to the bill because it would limit the DNR’s authority to hold polluters liable.\n\nThe Senate also voted to override the veto of a bill to make $15 million available for emergency hospital services in Chippewa or Eau Claire counties.\n\nSimilar to the fight over the PFAS funding, Evers and Republicans have not been able to agree on the best way to spend $15 million on health care in the wake of hospital closures in Eau Claire and Chippewa Falls. Evers signed a bill into law allowing for the spending, but the Legislature’s GOp-controlled budget committee has yet to approve it.\n\nAmong the eight other vetoes the Senate voted to override were bills that would require new post-election audits; set a new goal for the state’s gray wolf population; change the framework for teacher apprenticeship programs and require the transportation department to put the words “not valid for voting purposes” on identification cards of people who are not citizens.\n\nNot a single Democrat voted for any of the overrides.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(WBAY) - It’s an important, ceremonial day for Green Bay and the 2025 NFL Draft.\n\nThe ceremonial handoff football is beginning its journey in Wisconsin, leading to the 2025 NFL Draft countdown at Lambeau Field.\n\nThe handoff is like the passing of the torch, if you will, from Detroit to Green Bay. Detroit had an incredible turnout for this year’s draft with over 700,000 attendees. Green Bay is expecting 250,000 for draft events that will be more centrally located around the Titletown district\n\nThe Lake Express Ferry left Milwaukee Tuesday morning on a mission across Lake Michigan to pick up the special delivery in Muskegon, Mich. and returned shortly before noon. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers walked off the ferry carrying the football one-handed, gleefully showing it to the small crowd that was waiting.\n\nGov. Tony Evers carries the ceremonial handoff football for the 2025 NFL Draft that made a ferry trip from Michigan to Wisconsin(WBAY)\n\nThe football begins its Wisconsin journey in a part of the state that has a lot of pro football history. Early NFL teams were located in Milwaukee, Racine and Kenosha, and in 1939 Milwaukee hosted the NFL Draft. The Packers even played a portion of their schedule in Milwaukee from 1933 to 1994.\n\nThat football needs to make its way to Lambeau Field and Titletown for another ceremony -- the unveiling of the NFL Draft countdown clock.\n\nIt’ll make its way north from Milwaukee not by car but by bike. The group carrying the football includes riders from the Green Bay Packers, Travel Wisconsin, Wisconsin Bike Fed, and Green Bay-area bicycle shops and cycling advocates. The Packers say the cyclists will pedal past a few landmarks along the way to highlight tourism and the state’s stunning trails and outdoor activities.\n\nPackers Director of Public Affairs Ryan Popkey joked, “Remember this is a no-drop ride,” saying he didn’t want to get left behind.\n\nGetting the football to Lambeau Field is taking most of the day. It’s expected to reach Titletown around 6:30 p.m.\n\nAs the football is carried on the final leg from the Ray Nitschke practice field to Lambeau Field, kids are invited to carry on a Packers tradition. Kids will bikes should be in place for the ride on Armed Forces Drive by 6 p.m.\n\nThe 2025 NFL Draft starts Thursday, April 24, in less than 345 days.\n\nCopyright 2024 WBAY. All rights reserved.",
